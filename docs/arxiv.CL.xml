Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B, fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt. Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision (98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

<div> Keywords: Electric power marketing, Customer service, Large language models, Dialogue dataset, Knowledge augmentation

Summary:
Electric power marketing customer service is vital for addressing inquiries efficiently. Current systems like China's 95598 hotline often face challenges like slow response times and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o showcase strong general capabilities, they lack domain expertise and empathy necessary for this field. To address this gap, the researchers introduce ElectriQ, a new benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance LLMs in electric power marketing contexts. ElectriQ includes a dialogue dataset covering key service categories and introduces four evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and user-friendliness. By integrating domain-specific knowledge and employing a knowledge augmentation method, smaller models like LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and augmented, outperform larger models like GPT-4o in professionalism and user-friendliness. ElectriQ lays the groundwork for developing LLMs tailored to the specific needs of power marketing services.

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities, they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

<div> Keywords: illegal marketplaces, deep and dark web, language models, semi-supervised learning, illicit content detection 

Summary: 
This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that utilizes fine-tuned language models and a semi-supervised ensemble learning strategy to detect and categorize illicit marketplace content across various online platforms. By combining semantic representations extracted from a specialized transformer model with manually engineered features, the framework can effectively identify illicit sales-related documents and classify them into drug, weapon, or credential categories. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the model outperforms several baselines, showcasing its accuracy, F1-score, and robustness in detecting illicit content. The proposed approach showcases strong generalization abilities, robustness under limited supervision, and effectiveness in real-world scenarios of illicit content detection. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines, including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of 0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

<div> Keywords: subject access, large language models, multi-label classification, hybrid framework, Library of Congress Subject Headings <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Providing subject access to information resources is crucial for library management systems. While large language models (LLMs) have been used for classification tasks, they are not extensively explored for subject analysis. Traditional machine learning (ML) models struggle with unseen cases in subject analysis, prompting the need for a hybrid framework that combines embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This framework utilizes ML models to predict the optimal number of LCSH labels and post-edit LLM predictions with actual LCSH terms to address hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate that providing initial predictions and post-editing improve the control and vocabulary alignment of subject term predictions. This approach offers a promising method for enhancing subject analysis using LLMs in libraries. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1) predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2) post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and vocabulary-aligned outputs.

<div> Knowledge graphs, schema matching, entity matching, context matching, KG integration<br />
Summary:<br />
The study addresses the challenge of context matching in knowledge graphs (KGs). Unlike schema and identity matching, context matching is less explored despite its importance in integrating diverse and complex KGs. The proposed method includes label and triple matching using string manipulation, fuzzy matching, and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. By identifying mappings between triples conveying comparable information, entity-matching accuracy is improved. The approach demonstrates competitive performance in the OAEI competition and against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy in various test cases. Additionally, a new dataset is introduced to comprehensively evaluate the triple-matching step. <div>
arXiv:2507.22914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching, and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

Summary: 
Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is explored in this paper through formal definitions, theoretical analyses, and the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations. The concept of a hallucination risk for models is introduced, with bounds derived through learning-theoretic frameworks. Detection strategies such as token-level uncertainty estimation and attention alignment checks are surveyed. Mitigation approaches including retrieval-augmented generation and fact-verification modules are discussed. A unified detection and mitigation workflow is proposed to integrate these strategies. Evaluation protocols are outlined to quantify and reduce hallucinations, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental setups. This work provides a theoretical foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the challenge of hallucination in LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models. We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of hallucination in LLMs.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, temporal logic, longitudinal queries, diachronic question answering, financial news <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is effective at integrating static knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) but struggles with handling longitudinal queries. This new framework proposes a redesigned RAG pipeline infused with temporal logic to address this challenge. By disentangling queries into subjects and temporal windows, a specialized retriever is able to gather evidence that is both topically relevant and temporally coherent. The Analytical Diachronic Question Answering Benchmark (ADQAB) is introduced for evaluation, showing substantial accuracy gains compared to standard RAG implementations. The approach in this work enables RAG systems to analyze complex, real-world questions in a nuanced and evolutionary manner. The dataset and code for this study are publicly available for further research and development. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static, factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional, semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

Summary: <br />
The study explores feature universality in Gemma-2 language models, specifically Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B, to determine whether models of different scales converge on similar internal concepts. By applying the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline to residual-stream activations of each model, researchers aligned monosemantic features and compared them using SVCCA and RSA. The findings indicate that middle layers exhibit the highest similarity, while early and late layers show less overlap. Preliminary experiments extending the analysis to multi-token subspaces suggest that semantically similar subspaces interact comparably with language models. These results support the notion that despite variations in size, large language models delineate the world into consistent, interpretable features, reinforcing the idea of universality as a basis for cross-model interpretability. <div>

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar, interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a foundation for cross-model interpretability.

Summary: 
- The study aimed to develop models for predicting serious adverse event (SAE) results in clinical trials using information from trial registrations.
- Analysis of over 22,000 clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted to develop prediction models.
- Two models were developed: one to predict SAE rates between experimental and control arms, and another to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms.
- A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models was utilized for feature extraction.
- A sliding window method was developed to extract embeddings from long trial texts and consistently improved model performance.
- The best model achieved a 77.6% AUC for predicting SAE rates and an RMSE of 18.6% for predicting SAE proportions.
- The study emphasizes the underutilization of available data at ClinicalTrials.gov and the potential for improving trial design and identifying discrepancies in safety results. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event (SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107 two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error; RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g., ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model (ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across 12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion: Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported safety results.

arXiv:2507.22920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems.

<div> Keywords: Language models, Language Model Chain, hallucinations, knowledge extraction, prediction speed

Summary:

The Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm aims to address the issues of costly and inaccurate information production in language models. This algorithm works by utilizing multiple language models in a multi-stage cascade to improve prediction speed and accuracy while reducing hallucinations. The LMC algorithm was tested on extracting patient dates of birth from medical documents, showcasing significant improvements in accuracy and speed. The algorithm ensures that a language model's response is only considered correct if it exists in a collection of possible answers, preventing the generation of incorrect information. By feeding text corresponding to incorrect responses into more predictive language models, the LMC algorithm iteratively refines predictions until all are accurate. The results of applying the LMC algorithm suggest its potential for advancing the field of knowledge extraction and warrant further exploration in the future.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e., candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored much further in the future.

Summary: 
This paper examines the impact of sentiment from social media, particularly Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, on stock market movements, focusing on GameStop and AMC Entertainment. The study utilizes three sentiment analysis methods and finds that social media sentiment has a weak correlation with stock prices. Surprisingly, simpler metrics like comment volume and Google search trends are more predictive. The findings suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may not capture the complexity of retail investor behavior. Retail investor activity, as seen in the GameStop short squeeze, raises questions about the influence of online sentiment on stock prices. The study introduces a new sentiment analysis model designed to better interpret informal language and emojis in social media discussions. The research underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the nuances of market-moving online conversations. <div>

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends, exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems, knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios, two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages, especially the low-resource ones.

<div> Keywords: graduate programs, international students, peer feedback, online courses, language background

Summary:
The study explores the impact of native versus non-native English speaker status on peer feedback experiences in online computing courses in the U.S. It reveals that non-native English speakers tend to write more positively but receive less positive feedback in return, while native English speakers rate feedback less favorably. The sentiment analysis also considers the students' language background and reveals significant interactions when controlling for sex and age. The study highlights that language background plays a modest yet complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences in online computing courses. <div>

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S. students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the concept of Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents) to improve long-term memory integration. H-MEM organizes memory in multi-level fashion based on semantic abstraction, with each memory vector embedding a positional index for efficient retrieval. An index-based routing mechanism allows layer-by-layer retrieval without exhaustive similarity computations. The study evaluates the approach on LoCoMo dataset with five task settings, showing consistent outperformance of five baseline methods. H-MEM enhances decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents, addressing limitations in structured memory organization and retrieval efficiency. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in long-term dialogue scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents. While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer. During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient, layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations. We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue scenarios.

<div> Keywords: document-level relation extraction, global context, multi-sentence reasoning, input encoding, entity relationships

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel input embedding approach for document-level relation extraction that considers the entire document context rather than just the sentences where entities are mentioned. By representing entities as standalone segments throughout the document, the proposed method leverages global relationships and multi-sentence reasoning to accurately predict entity relationships. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets, including DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL, demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in accurately predicting entity relationships. The research advances global context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation extraction, providing theoretical advancements in the field. Practically, the proposed method enhances relationship detection in NLP applications, offering improved performance and interpretability of entity-level insights. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another. Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences. Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments, independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level insights and interpretability.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Large Language Models, Benchmark, Document Utilization, Placeholder-Based Approach

Summary: 
The article introduces a fine-grained benchmark called Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark for evaluating the document utilization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The benchmark focuses on multi-level filtering abilities, combination abilities, and reference reasoning to assess the LLM's performance in generating responses based on retrieved documents. By using a placeholder-based approach, the study decouples the contributions of the LLM's knowledge and external knowledge, revealing limitations in error resilience and context faithfulness of representative LLMs in RAG systems. The benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and efficient RAG systems. Experimental results highlight the need for improvement in LLM-specific capabilities within RAG systems. The code for the benchmark is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Alipay-Med/PRGB. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial. However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce \textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark, emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in https://github.com/Alipay-Med/PRGB.

<div> Keywords: Chain-of-thought prompting, Large Language Models, Causal study, Activation patching, Modular internal computation

Summary:
Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) on multi-step tasks. This study investigates the faithfulness of CoT-generated "thoughts" by analyzing monosemantic features extracted from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B models while solving math problems. The results reveal that CoT significantly increases answer log-probabilities in the larger 2.8B model but not in the 70M model, indicating a scale threshold. CoT also leads to higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger model, suggesting more modular internal computation. The confidence of generating correct answers improves with CoT. Patching analysis shows that useful CoT information is distributed widely across features. Overall, CoT induces more interpretable internal structures in high-capacity LLMs, supporting its role as a structured prompting method.

<br /><br />Summary: 
- CoT prompting boosts LLM accuracy on multi-step tasks.
- Study analyzes CoT faithfulness using feature-level causal analysis.
- The 2.8B model shows a significant impact of CoT on answer log-probabilities.
- CoT leads to higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in large models.
- Confidence in generating correct answers improves with CoT. <div>
arXiv:2507.22928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting. Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed. Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting method.

<div> Benchmark, Ophthalmology, Hallucinations, Language Models, Multimodal Data
Summary:
EH-Benchmark is a new ophthalmology benchmark created to evaluate hallucinations in Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs). The challenges faced by MLLMs include limited ophthalmic knowledge, lack of visual localization and reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data. The benchmark categorizes MLLMs' hallucinations into two primary classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each with multiple subclasses. A three-phase framework is proposed to mitigate hallucinations, including Knowledge-Level Retrieval, Task-Level Case Studies, and Result-Level Validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework significantly improves accuracy, interpretability, and reliability of MLLMs. The project is available on GitHub at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs' hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

arXiv:2507.22930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3 text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence, i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

Summary: 
The article introduces Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework aimed at improving inference efficiency in large language models that integrate external knowledge. ACC-RAG dynamically adjusts compression rates based on the complexity of input queries, optimizing both speed and accuracy. By combining a hierarchical compressor with a context selector, ACC-RAG mimics human skimming behavior to retain essential information while discarding unnecessary details. Evaluation on various datasets demonstrates that ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods, unlocking over four times faster inference speed without compromising accuracy. This innovative approach to context compression shows promising results in enhancing the performance of retrieval-augmented generation models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining. Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information systems.

Operational intelligence derived from organizational data repositories faces challenges due to data confidentiality and integration objectives. This work discusses the Knowledge Extraction process, including Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation Extraction. Sixteen NLP tools are evaluated alongside Large Language Models for operational and maintenance intelligence in the aircraft industry. The study uses a baseline dataset from the US Federal Aviation Administration to assess zero-shot performance in a confidential environment. Significant limitations are observed, highlighting challenges in trusted NLP and LLM tools for mission-critical industries like aviation.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation. We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks. However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored. Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the 'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent, semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how prompts are written and what source material is used.

<div> Keywords: AIOps, collaboration-of-expert framework, large language model, retrieval-augmented generation, DevOps-EVAL dataset

Summary: <br /><br />
The paper introduces a collaboration-of-expert framework (CoE-Ops) for AIOps in DevOps, integrating a large language model task classifier. By incorporating a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism, the framework can handle both high-level and low-level tasks in AIOps effectively. Experimental results on the DevOps-EVAL dataset show that CoE-Ops significantly improves routing accuracy for high-level tasks, outperforming existing CoE methods. Additionally, the framework enhances accuracy in problem resolution by up to 8% compared to single AIOps models. Moreover, CoE-Ops surpasses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models in accuracy, indicating its superiority in AIOps domain applications. <div>

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.) and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

<br />
Summary: 
This study introduces an innovative approach to Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents, focusing on flowchart images in the telecom domain. By incorporating graph representations of flowcharts from Visual large Language Models (VLMs) into a text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, the authors demonstrate improved QA performance. The process involves document processing, image classification, graph building, and integration with text embedding for efficient retrieval. Results reveal that fine-tuned VLM models provide robust graph representations with low edit distances compared to ground truth. The approach not only enhances retrieval performance using text-based embedding models but also eliminates the need for VLM in inference, reducing costs for deployed QA systems. Overall, the study showcases the efficacy of leveraging VLM-generated graph representations for QA tasks involving flowchart images in technical documents within the telecom domain.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams. Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents, classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth, which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images. Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference, which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

<div> fact-checking classifier, Group Relative Policy Optimization, mechanistic interpretability, factual accuracy, large language models 

Summary:
The RELIANCE framework addresses the issue of factual inaccuracies in Large Language Models (LLMs) during reasoning processes. It consists of a fact-checking classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data, a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach, and a mechanistic interpretability module to enhance factual accuracy. Evaluation of ten state-of-the-art models reveals low reasoning factual accuracy, with leading models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 only reaching around 80%. RELIANCE significantly improves factual robustness by up to 49.90% while maintaining or enhancing performance on challenging benchmarks such as Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA. The activation-level analysis provides insights into how factual enhancements impact reasoning trajectories within model architectures, laying the groundwork for future training methodologies targeting factual robustness through activation-guided optimization. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers. This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality, coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and (3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA. Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

<div> Keywords: Electronic medical reports, machine learning, survival analysis, SigBERT, temporal dynamics <br />
Summary:<br />
- SigBERT is proposed as a framework for temporal survival analysis in healthcare, specifically designed to handle sequential textual data from electronic medical reports (EHR).
- SigBERT processes timestamped medical reports by extracting word embeddings and deriving sentence embeddings through averaging in order to capture complex temporal dynamics.
- The framework utilizes signature extraction from rough path theory to generate geometric features from the time series of sentence embedding coordinates, enhancing the performance of the survival model.
- These features are then utilized in a LASSO-penalized Cox model to estimate patient-specific risk scores, resulting in a C-index score of 0.75 on an independent test cohort from a real-world oncology dataset.
- SigBERT integrates sequential medical data effectively to improve risk estimation in narrative-based survival analysis. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However, existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing narrative-based survival analysis.

<div> Natural language processing, validation study, claims databases, code-based algorithms, outcome misclassification <br />
Summary: <br />
The article focuses on enhancing analyses conducted with large claims databases by validating code-based algorithms for identifying health outcomes. It introduces an expedited validation process using natural language processing (NLP) to reduce manual chart review time and a multi-wave adaptive sampling approach to stop the study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient precision. The case study validates a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in obese patients. The NLP-assisted annotation process reduced review time by 40%, and the pre-defined stopping rule would have prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to measurement precision. This approach could enable more routine validation of code-based algorithms, improving the reliability of findings from database studies. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.22943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by 40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of find-ings derived from database studies.

<title>Opacity as Authority: Arbitrariness and the Preclusion of Contestation</title>

<div> Keywords: arbitrariness, semiotic trait, motivation, Contestability, artificial intelligence systems

Summary: 
Arbitrariness is redefined in this article as a foundational functional mechanism present in human systems and interactions. It is seen as a semiotic trait that enables systems to operate effectively while withholding their internal rationale, extending beyond language to law and social dynamics. The "Motivation -> Constatability -> Contestability" chain is introduced, with motivation being key in rendering an act's logic contestable. Mechanisms like "immotivization" and "Conflict Lateralization" can break this chain, leading to acts producing binding effects without revealing their rationale, thus evading accountability. Formalized as conditional entropy, arbitrariness is proposed as a neutral operator crucial in interpersonal relations and control mechanisms. This framework also provides insight into analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability, particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation -> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like "immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence systems.

<div> Keywords: Spoken Dialogue Models, Large Language Models, benchmark dataset, human conversational dynamics, evaluation method

Summary:
Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have gained popularity for generating voice responses to user queries but lack comprehensive research on their effectiveness compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs). Human voice interactions present unique challenges such as ambiguity from semantic and phonological factors, as well as context-dependency like omission and coreference. To bridge this gap, a benchmark dataset with 1,079 instances in English and Chinese is introduced, enabling a thorough evaluation of SDMs. An evaluation method aligned with human judgment is provided to assess SDMs in handling these complexities. This dataset aims to shed light on the current state of SDM development and their capabilities in understanding and simulating human conversations.

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns. Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079 instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these practical challenges.

Summary:  
- The study explores whether contemporary Language Model models (LLMs) can effectively perform natural language inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts, termed the Math NLI problem.  
- A corpus of Math NLI pairs is constructed, with premises from mathematical text and hypotheses from experts in both mathematics research and NLI.  
- The quality of corpora using LLM-generated hypotheses is also examined.  
- Positive findings include the use of a majority vote of LLMs being comparable to human-labeled data in certain Math NLI scenarios.  
- However, LLMs struggle with mathematical language and occasionally fail at basic inferences.  
- Current models are less susceptible to hypothesis-only "inference" compared to previous generations.  
- The corpora are provided to support future research on Math NLI.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem. We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field. We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs. We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings, we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

Summary: 
Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) involves identifying predicates and their arguments based on Frame Semantics. This study explores the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for FSP tasks without fine-tuning the model. The method generates task-specific prompts for Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role Labeling (FSRL) using the FrameNet database. These prompts guide six different LLMs in experiments focused on frames related to violent events, achieving competitive F1 scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The results demonstrate that ICL can be a practical and effective approach for domain-specific FSP tasks, providing an alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1 scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for domain-specific FSP tasks.

<div> Rotary Positional Embeddings, RoPE, context-sensitive relationships, token embeddings, CARoPE<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Positional encoding is crucial in Transformer architectures for incorporating sequence order into self-attention mechanisms. While RoPE has been widely adopted for its efficiency, it lacks the ability to model context-sensitive relationships due to its static frequency patterns. In this work, CARoPE is introduced as a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates head-specific frequency patterns based on token embeddings. By computing input-dependent phase shifts using a transformation of token embeddings, CARoPE offers token- and context-sensitive positional representations while maintaining efficiency and simplicity. Evaluation on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset with GPT-2 variants shows that CARoPE outperforms RoPE and other positional encoding baselines, achieving lower perplexity even at longer context lengths. Moreover, CARoPE enables faster training throughput without compromising model stability, making it a scalable, expressive, and efficient enhancement to positional encoding strategies in Transformer models. <div>

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures, enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms. Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally, CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability. These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer models.

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images) domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain, cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images. Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

Summary: 
The article presents a novel approach to scaling natural language interfaces for databases to enterprise-level data catalogs. The proposed component-based retrieval architecture decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, allowing for more targeted retrieval. This approach prioritizes table identification while leveraging column-level information to ensure manageable context budgets. Experimental results show high recall and accuracy, with the system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying structures and metadata availability. The solution eliminates the need for domain-specific fine-tuning, making it practical for deployment in diverse enterprise settings.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget. Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy, with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database interfaces.

<div> Keywords: trustworthiness, large language models, Chinese textual ambiguity, dataset, language understanding

Summary: <br /><br />Large language models (LLMs) face challenges when encountering ambiguous narrative text, especially in the context of Chinese textual ambiguity. A benchmark dataset was created to study LLM behavior in handling ambiguity, revealing significant differences from human interpretation. LLMs struggle to distinguish between ambiguous and unambiguous text, often displaying overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single meaning. Additionally, LLMs tend to overthink when trying to understand multiple possible meanings within ambiguous text. These findings underscore a critical limitation in current LLMs and emphasize the need for improved approaches to address uncertainty in language understanding. The publicly available dataset and code provide valuable resources for further research in this area. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs, representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans. Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/ictup/LLM-Chinese-Textual-Disambiguation.

<div> benchmark, causal relationships, multimodal models, vision-language, performance 

Summary: 
ISO-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating causal relationships between visual observations and procedural text in multimodal models. The benchmark presents image-text pairs of task steps to determine temporal dependencies. Current vision-language models perform below human level, with the best zero-shot F1 score at 0.57 and chain-of-thought reasoning improving results up to 0.62 F1. Humans outperform models with a 0.98 F1 score. The findings suggest the need for enhancements in causal understanding within multimodal models. <div>

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal models.

<div> Keywords: language models, user feedback, user-LM interaction, implicit feedback, model performance<br />
Summary: <br /><br />Language models (LMs) can benefit from continuous evolution based on user feedback harvested from user-LM interaction logs. The study analyzes implicit user feedback in two datasets and finds that the content of user feedback, not just its polarity, can enhance model performance in short human-designed questions. However, this improvement is not seen in longer and more complex questions. The study also highlights that the quality of the initial prompt from the user is essential for the usefulness of feedback. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential and limitations of implicit user feedback for enhancing the performance of language models. <div>
arXiv:2507.23158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench). We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

<div> confidence, Large Language Models, ensemble learning, neural networks, internal representations

Summary:
LENS introduces a novel method for combining the predictions of multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning to estimate model confidence through analyzing internal representations. By training a linear confidence predictor for each LLM, LENS effectively weights model predictions based on context-dependent reliability without modifying the model parameters. Experimental results on question-answering tasks show that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble methods significantly. This approach leverages neural network hidden states and normalized probabilities to provide nuanced weighting of predictions, leading to improved system robustness and performance. The findings indicate that internal representations offer valuable signals for determining model confidence and can be leveraged for enhancing ensemble learning in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2507.23167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

<br />
In response to the increasing demand for AI-generated GPU kernels, a new evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and the GEAK framework have been developed. The Triton language, known for its balance of performance and ease of coding, is a popular target for AI-generated kernels. The GEAK framework utilizes cutting-edge LLMs to generate efficient Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, such as the AMD MI300X and MI250. By leveraging inference-time compute scaling and a Reflexion-style feedback mechanism, GEAK significantly outperformed baseline approaches in terms of correctness and execution speed. The results demonstrate the potential of GEAK-like agentic code generation in accelerating the adoption of diverse hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia. As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs, aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

<title>Failures Are the Stepping Stones to Success: Enhancing Few-Shot In-Context Learning by Leveraging Negative Samples</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Few-shot in-context learning, Positive samples, Negative samples, Semantic similarity

Summary:
In this study, the focus is on improving few-shot in-context learning (ICL) by leveraging both Positive and Negative samples for better example selection. The research builds Positive and Negative sample corpora based on Zero-Shot-Cot and uses semantic similarity for selecting examples during inference. By incorporating information from Negative samples, the method enhances the selection of Positive examples, thereby improving ICL performance. Results indicate that utilizing Negative samples in example selection leads to better performance compared to methods solely relying on Positive samples. This innovative approach demonstrates the importance of considering both Positive and Negative samples in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of few-shot in-context learning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL. Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through improved Positive sample selection.

<div> Keywords: topic models, sparse autoencoders, semantic features, controllable text generation, evaluation framework

Summary:
Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs) are introduced as a new class of topic models that utilize interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Unlike traditional and neural topic models that rely on word lists, MTMs operate on semantically rich spaces to reveal deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. They also enable controllable text generation through topic-based steering vectors, a unique feature among topic models. Evaluation using the topic judge framework shows that MTMs match or exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are preferred by judges, and allow effective steering of language model outputs. Overall, MTMs offer a promising approach to capturing complex topics in large text collections with improved interpretability and performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover, uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Summary:
TAP-GPT is a novel framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for the early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by analyzing heterogeneous biomarkers in a tabular format. The framework, based on TableGPT2 and adapted for AD diagnosis, incorporates few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability. By constructing tabular prompts with in-context learning examples and using parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, TAP-GPT outperforms other LLMs and a tabular foundation model for AD prediction tasks. This approach represents a groundbreaking application of LLMs in utilizing tabular biomarker data for AD diagnosis, opening new avenues for LLM-driven frameworks in biomedical informatics. <br /><br />Summary: TAP-GPT harnesses the power of large language models for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis through tabular data analysis, offering superior prediction capabilities compared to existing models. <div>
arXiv:2507.23227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to the other two LLMs.

Summary:<br /><br />In this work, the challenges faced in Bengali NLP performance are explored, with a focus on the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. 10 recent Large Language Models were evaluated on translated datasets, highlighting performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, especially in smaller models and specific families. Certain architectures, like DeepSeek, show promising robustness across languages. An inverse relationship between tokenization efficiency and model accuracy was observed, with more concise tokenization leading to improved performance. The study emphasizes the need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methods tailored for multilingual contexts to advance NLP research for underrepresented languages and make advanced language technologies more accessible worldwide. <div>

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient \& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

Summary: 
SEs, termed Super Experts, have been identified as a crucial subset in Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. These SEs exhibit extreme activation outliers, impacting the model's performance significantly, especially in mathematical reasoning tasks. Pruning SEs leads to repetitive and uninformative outputs, emphasizing their importance in ensuring model efficiency. SEs induce attention sinks vital for attention score distribution but are disrupted by pruning, affecting model functionality. The distribution and influence of SEs are model-specific, remaining consistent post-training. Analysis shows SEs play a fundamental role in the model's forward inference mechanism. The research provides a deeper understanding of SEs' heterogeneous importance and their contribution to enhancing MoE LLMs' learning capacity. The available code enables further exploration and validation of the findings.

arXiv:2507.23279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs. However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g., pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii) We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly disrupted by SE pruning.

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts. Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against traditional methods.

arXiv:2507.23334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities, showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

<title>MPCC: A Novel Benchmark for Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13 advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only 21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally, we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios. Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

<title>Causal2Vec: Improving Decoder-only LLMs as Versatile Embedding Models</title>

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks. However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining. Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs without altering their original architectures or introducing significant computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture contextualized information even without attending to future tokens. Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared to best-performing methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of individual translators and small businesses.

<title>MRGSEM-Sum: An Unsupervised Multi-document Summarization Framework based on Multi-Relational Graphs and Structural Entropy Minimization</title>

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News, DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

<title>Enhanced Arabic Text Retrieval with Attentive Relevance Scoring</title>

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects. Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages. Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available at \href{https://github.com/Bekhouche/APR}{GitHub}.

<title>Beyond Passive Critical Thinking: Fostering Proactive Questioning to Enhance Human-AI Collaboration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23407</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.23407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions. Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking, especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm, we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to 73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic, role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

<title>A Novel Evaluation Benchmark for Medical LLMs: Illuminating Safety and Effectiveness in Clinical Domains</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30 criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures. Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&amp;A items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%), with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001). Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs, facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in healthcare environments.

<title>Med-R$^3$: Enhancing Medical Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning of LLMs via Progressive Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance. Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

<title>T-Detect: Tail-Aware Statistical Normalization for Robust Detection of Adversarial Machine-Generated Text</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the development of robust detection methods capable of identifying machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution, providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at https://github.com/ResearAI/t-detect.

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks, including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this behavior.

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1) to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached 0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state of the art machine translation systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules. Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets, FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts and data used in this study are publicly available at https://github.com/idirlab/KGRule2NL}{https://github.com/idirlab/KGRule2NL.

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families. Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

Abstract: Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and language-learning platforms often fail to adapt in real time to the user's cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological conditions such as post-stroke aphasia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)--based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and transformer--based large language models (LLMs) offer complementary strengths: BCIs capture users' neural intent with low fatigue, while LLMs generate contextually tailored language content. We propose and evaluate a novel hybrid framework that leverages real-time EEG signals to drive an LLM-powered language rehabilitation assistant. This system aims to: (1) enable users with severe speech or motor impairments to navigate language-learning modules via mental commands; (2) dynamically personalize vocabulary, sentence-construction exercises, and corrective feedback; and (3) monitor neural markers of cognitive effort to adjust task difficulty on the fly.

Abstract: We developed a voice-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system that guides anyone - from paramedics to family members - through expert-level stroke evaluations using natural conversation, while also enabling smartphone video capture of key examination components for documentation and potential expert review. This addresses a critical gap in emergency care: current stroke recognition by first responders is inconsistent and often inaccurate, with sensitivity for stroke detection as low as 58%, causing life-threatening delays in treatment. Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just over 6 minutes. Users reported high confidence (median 4.5/5) and ease of use (mean 4.67/5). The system successfully identified 86% of actual strokes but also incorrectly flagged 2 of 3 non-stroke cases as strokes. When an expert physician reviewed the AI reports with videos, they identified the correct diagnosis in 100% of cases, but felt confident enough to make preliminary treatment decisions in only 40% of cases due to observed AI errors including incorrect scoring and false information. While the current system's limitations necessitate human oversight, ongoing rapid advancements in speech-to-speech AI models suggest that future versions are poised to enable highly accurate assessments. Achieving human-level voice interaction could transform emergency medical care, putting expert-informed assessment capabilities in everyone's hands.

Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2% of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%; the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians. These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare workforce shortages.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative opportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios. However, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially across different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack appropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure general intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically designed for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular architecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues through simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design without requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a hybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective pedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational scenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching, Interdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question Generation, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with education specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability distributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and limitations. ELMES provides educators and researchers with an accessible evaluation framework that significantly reduces adaptation barriers for diverse educational applications while advancing the practical implementation of LLMs in pedagogy. The framework is publicly available at \emph{https://github.com/sii-research/elmes.git}.

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation. These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender independence than the baseline MFCCs.

We introduce \textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house data demonstrate significant improvements, with $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3 for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable, annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling, designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g., autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation. This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers (JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent. Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies, highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

<title>SWE-Debate: Competitive Multi-Agent Debate for Software Issue Resolution</title>

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks. While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts. Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes. Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6% Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue resolution.

Abstract: Topic models are gaining increasing commercial and academic interest for their ability to summarize large volumes of unstructured text. As unsupervised machine learning methods, they enable researchers to explore data and help general users understand key themes in large text collections. However, they risk becoming a 'black box', where users input data and accept the output as an accurate summary without scrutiny. This article evaluates topic models from a database perspective, drawing insights from 1140 BERTopic model runs. The goal is to identify trade-offs in optimizing model parameters and to reflect on what these findings mean for the interpretation and responsible use of topic models

<title>Counterfactual Evaluation for Blind Attack Detection in LLM-based Evaluation Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer. An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.

Abstract: While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs. The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at https://github.com/xiaomi-research/mecat

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into expressive representations. These representations are then combined with encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration, assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from 0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA, a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a research demo for public testing.

Abstract: The Latin language has received attention from the computational linguistics research community, which has built, over the years, several valuable resources, ranging from detailed annotated corpora to sophisticated tools for linguistic analysis. With the recent advent of large language models, researchers have also started developing models capable of generating vector representations of Latin texts. The performances of such models remain behind the ones for modern languages, given the disparity in available data. In this paper, we present the LiMe dataset, a corpus of 325 documents extracted from a series of medieval manuscripts called Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani, and thoroughly annotated by experts, in order to be employed for masked language model, as well as supervised natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: Why is language vague? Vagueness may be explained and rationalized if it can be shown that vague language is more useful to speaker and hearer than precise language. In a well-known paper, Lipman proposes a game-theoretic account of vagueness in terms of mixed strategy that leads to a puzzle: vagueness cannot be strictly better than precision at equilibrium. More recently, \'Egr\'e, Spector, Mortier and Verheyen have put forward a Bayesian account of vagueness establishing that using vague words can be strictly more informative than using precise words. This paper proposes to compare both results and to explain why they are not in contradiction. Lipman's definition of vagueness relies exclusively on a property of signaling strategies, without making any assumptions about the lexicon, whereas \'Egr\'e et al.'s involves a layer of semantic content. We argue that the semantic account of vagueness is needed, and more adequate and explanatory of vagueness.

Abstract: Real-world applications of KBQA require models to handle unanswerable questions with a limited volume of in-domain labeled training data. We propose the novel task of few-shot transfer for KBQA with unanswerable questions and contribute two new datasets for performance evaluation. We present FUn-FuSIC - a novel solution for our task that extends FuSIC KBQA, the state-of-the-art few-shot transfer model for answerable-only KBQA. We first note that FuSIC-KBQA's iterative repair makes a strong assumption that all questions are unanswerable. As a remedy, we propose Feedback for Unanswerability (FUn), which uses iterative repair using feedback from a suite of strong and weak verifiers, and an adaptation of self consistency for unanswerabilty to better assess the answerability of a question. Our experiments show that FUn-FuSIC significantly outperforms suitable adaptations of multiple LLM based and supervised SoTA models on our task, while establishing a new SoTA for answerable few-shot transfer as well.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including solving math word problems (MWPs), but struggle with real-world problems containing irrelevant information. To address this, we propose a prompting framework that generates adversarial variants of MWPs by adding irrelevant variables. We introduce a dataset, PROBLEMATHIC, containing both adversarial and non-adversarial MWPs. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are susceptible to distraction by numerical noise, resulting in an average relative performance drop of ~26% on adversarial MWPs. To mitigate this, we fine-tune LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral) on the adversarial samples from our dataset. Fine-tuning on adversarial training instances improves performance on adversarial MWPs by ~8%, indicating increased robustness to noise and improved ability to identify relevant data for reasoning. Finally, to assess the generalizability of our prompting framework, we introduce GSM-8K-Adv, an adversarial variant of the GSM-8K benchmark. LLMs continue to struggle when faced with adversarial information, reducing performance by up to 6%.

Abstract: Ambiguous words are often found in modern digital communications. Lexical ambiguity challenges traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods, due to limited data. Consequently, the efficiency of translation, information retrieval, and question-answering systems is hindered by these limitations. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve WSD using a novel approach combining a systematic prompt augmentation mechanism with a knowledge base (KB) consisting of different sense interpretations. The proposed method incorporates a human-in-loop approach for prompt augmentation where prompt is supported by Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, synonyms of ambiguous words, aspect-based sense filtering and few-shot prompting to guide the LLM. By utilizing a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompting-based approach, this work demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance. The evaluation was conducted using FEWS test data and sense tags. This research advances accurate word interpretation in social media and digital communication.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in aligning with diverse cultural values despite their remarkable performance in generation, which stems from inherent monocultural biases and difficulties in capturing nuanced cultural semantics. Existing methods struggle to adapt to unknown culture after fine-tuning. Inspired by cultural geography across five continents, we propose Cultural Palette, a multi-agent framework that redefines cultural alignment as an adaptive "color-blending" process for country-specific adaptation. Our approach harnesses cultural geography across five continents (Africa, America, Asia, Europe, Oceania) through three key steps: First, we synthesize the Pentachromatic Cultural Palette Dataset using GPT-4o, refining continental-level dialogues with Hofstede's cultural dimensions to establish foundational cultural representations. Second, five continent-level alignment agents form specialized cultural communities that generate region-specific draft responses. Third, a Meta Agent employs Cultural MoErges to dynamically blend these cultural "colors" through attention-gated parameter merging, akin to mixing pigments on a palette, resolving conflicts while preserving cultural nuances to produce the final culturally-aligned response. Extensive experiments across various countries demonstrate that Cultural Palette surpasses existing baselines in cultural alignment.

Abstract: This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models (LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express in their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.

Abstract: Abstractive multi-document summarization (MDS) is the task of automatically summarizing information in multiple documents, from news articles to conversations with multiple speakers. The training approaches for current MDS models can be grouped into four approaches: end-to-end with special pre-training ("direct"), chunk-then-summarize, extract-then-summarize, and inference with GPT-style models. In this work, we evaluate MDS models across training approaches, domains, and dimensions (reference similarity, quality, and factuality), to analyze how and why models trained on one domain can fail to summarize documents from another (News, Science, and Conversation) in the zero-shot domain transfer setting. We define domain-transfer "failure" as a decrease in factuality, higher deviation from the target, and a general decrease in summary quality. In addition to exploring domain transfer for MDS models, we examine potential issues with applying popular summarization metrics out-of-the-box.

Abstract: Variation in language use, shaped by speakers' sociocultural background and specific context of use, offers a rich lens into cultural perspectives, values, and opinions. However, the computational study of these Sociocultural Linguistic Phenomena (SLP) has often been limited to bespoke analyses of specific groups or topics, hindering the pace of scientific discovery. To address this, we introduce Splits!, a 9.7 million-post dataset from Reddit designed for systematic and flexible research. The dataset contains posts from over 53,000 users across 6 demographic groups, organized into 89 discussion topics to enable comparative analysis. We validate Splits! via self-identification and by successfully replicating several known SLPs from existing literature. We complement this dataset with a framework that leverages efficient retrieval methods to rapidly validate potential SLPs (PSLPs) by automatically evaluating whether a given hypothesis is supported by our data. Crucially, to distinguish between novel and obvious insights, the framework incorporates a human-validated measure of a hypothesis's ``unexpectedness.'' We demonstrate that the two-stage process reduces the number of statistically significant findings requiring manual inspection by a factor of 1.5-1.8x, streamlining the discovery of promising phenomena for further investigation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but their development has primarily focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving many languages underserved. We present our latest Hindi-English bi-lingual LLM \textbf{Mantra-14B} with ~3\% average improvement in benchmark scores over both languages, outperforming models twice its size. Using a curated dataset composed of English and Hindi instruction data of 485K samples, we instruction tuned models such as Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct and Phi-4 to improve performance over both English and Hindi. Our experiments encompassing seven different LLMs of varying parameter sizes and over 140 training attempts with varying English-Hindi training data ratios demonstrated that it is possible to significantly improve multilingual performance without compromising native performance. Further, our approach avoids resource-intensive techniques like vocabulary expansion or architectural modifications, thus keeping the model size small. Our results indicate that modest fine-tuning with culturally and locally informed data can bridge performance gaps without incurring significant computational overhead. We release our training code, datasets, and models under mit and apache licenses to aid further research towards under-represented and low-resource languages.

Abstract: An ideal detection system for machine generated content is supposed to work well on any generator as many more advanced LLMs come into existence day by day. Existing systems often struggle with accurately identifying AI-generated content over shorter texts. Further, not all texts might be entirely authored by a human or LLM, hence we focused more over partial cases i.e human-LLM co-authored texts. Our paper introduces a set of models built for the task of token classification which are trained on an extensive collection of human-machine co-authored texts, which performed well over texts of unseen domains, unseen generators, texts by non-native speakers and those with adversarial inputs. We also introduce a new dataset of over 2.4M such texts mostly co-authored by several popular proprietary LLMs over 23 languages. We also present findings of our models' performance over each texts of each domain and generator. Additional findings include comparison of performance against each adversarial method, length of input texts and characteristics of generated texts compared to the original human authored texts.

<title>Vision-Language Models Are Not Pragmatically Competent in Referring Expression Generation</title>

Abstract: Referring Expression Generation (REG) is a core task for evaluating the pragmatic competence of vision-language systems, requiring not only accurate semantic grounding but also adherence to principles of cooperative communication (Grice, 1975). However, current evaluations of vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook the pragmatic dimension, reducing REG to a region-based captioning task and neglecting Gricean maxims. In this work, we revisit REG from a pragmatic perspective, introducing a new dataset (RefOI) of 1.5k images annotated with both written and spoken referring expressions. Through a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, we identify three key failures of pragmatic competence: (1) failure to uniquely identify the referent, (2) inclusion of excessive or irrelevant information, and (3) misalignment with human pragmatic preference, such as the underuse of minimal spatial cues. We also show that standard automatic evaluations fail to capture these pragmatic violations, reinforcing superficial cues rather than genuine referential success. Our findings call for a renewed focus on pragmatically informed models and evaluation frameworks that align with real human communication.

Abstract: Constructing specialized content corpora from vast, unstructured web sources for domain-specific applications poses substantial data curation challenges. In this paper, we introduce a streamlined approach for generating high-quality, domain-specific corpora by efficiently acquiring, filtering, structuring, and cleaning web-based data. We showcase how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to address complex data curation at scale, and propose a strategical framework incorporating LLM-enhanced techniques for structured content extraction and semantic deduplication. We validate our approach in the behavior education domain through its integration into 30 Day Me, a habit formation application. Our data pipeline, named 30DayGen, enabled the extraction and synthesis of 3,531 unique 30-day challenges from over 15K webpages. A user survey reports a satisfaction score of 4.3 out of 5, with 91% of respondents indicating willingness to use the curated content for their habit-formation goals.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for dysarthric speech remains challenging due to data scarcity, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we fine-tune a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech (UASpeech) to encode both speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions, then apply it to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model, Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE (Tamil) demonstrates that VC with both speaker and prosody conversion significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and subjective analyses of the generated data further confirm that the generated speech simulates dysarthric characteristics.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emerging capabilities in social intelligence tasks, including implicature resolution and theory-of-mind reasoning, both of which require substantial pragmatic understanding. However, how LLMs acquire this pragmatic competence throughout the training process remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce ALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of alternatives, to evaluate whether LLMs at different training stages can accurately infer nuanced speaker intentions. Each instance pairs two equally plausible yet pragmatically divergent continuations and requires the model to (i) infer the speaker's intended meaning and (ii) explain when and why a speaker would choose one utterance over its alternative, thus directly probing pragmatic competence through contrastive reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across 3 key training stages: after pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to examine the development of pragmatic competence. Our results show that even base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves consistently with increases in model and data scale. Additionally, SFT and RLHF contribute further gains, particularly in cognitive-pragmatic scenarios. These findings highlight pragmatic competence as an emergent and compositional property of LLM training and offer new insights for aligning models with human communicative norms.

Abstract: We present AutoSchemaKG, a framework for fully autonomous knowledge graph construction that eliminates the need for predefined schemas. Our system leverages large language models to simultaneously extract knowledge triples and induce comprehensive schemas directly from text, modeling both entities and events while employing conceptualization to organize instances into semantic categories. Processing over 50 million documents, we construct ATLAS (Automated Triple Linking And Schema induction), a family of knowledge graphs with 900+ million nodes and 5.9 billion edges. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multi-hop QA tasks and enhances LLM factuality. Notably, our schema induction achieves 95\% semantic alignment with human-crafted schemas with zero manual intervention, demonstrating that billion-scale knowledge graphs with dynamically induced schemas can effectively complement parametric knowledge in large language models.

<title>Framing Political Bias in Multilingual LLMs Across Pakistani Languages</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape public discourse, yet most evaluations of political and economic bias have focused on high-resource, Western languages and contexts. This leaves critical blind spots in low-resource, multilingual regions such as Pakistan, where linguistic identity is closely tied to political, religious, and regional ideologies. We present a systematic evaluation of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five Pakistani languages: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto, and Balochi. Our framework integrates a culturally adapted Political Compass Test (PCT) with multi-level framing analysis, capturing both ideological stance (economic/social axes) and stylistic framing (content, tone, emphasis). Prompts are aligned with 11 socio-political themes specific to the Pakistani context. Results show that while LLMs predominantly reflect liberal-left orientations consistent with Western training data, they exhibit more authoritarian framing in regional languages, highlighting language-conditioned ideological modulation. We also identify consistent model-specific bias patterns across languages. These findings show the need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing frameworks in global NLP.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith) reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM reasoning. The implementation is available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/theorem-of-thought.

<title>Unable to Forget: Proactive Interference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length</title>

Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup. While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs' ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information, suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval.

Abstract: This survey paper outlines the key developments in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs), including enhancements to their reasoning skills, adaptability to various tasks, increased computational efficiency, and the ability to make ethical decisions. The techniques that have been most effective in bridging the gap between human and machine communications include the Chain-of-Thought prompting, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. The improvements in multimodal learning and few-shot or zero-shot techniques have further empowered LLMs to handle complex jobs with minor input. A significant focus is placed on efficiency, detailing scaling strategies, optimization techniques, and the influential Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which strategically routes inputs to specialized subnetworks to boost predictive accuracy, while optimizing resource allocation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on recent advancements in LLMs, going beyond isolated aspects such as model architecture or ethical concerns. Additionally, it explores the role of LLMs in Agentic AI and their use as Autonomous Decision-Making Systems, and categorizes emerging methods that enhance LLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. The survey also identifies underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration, and sustainability. While significant advancements have been made in LLMs, challenges such as high computational costs, biases, and ethical risks remain. Overcoming these requires a focus on bias mitigation, transparent decision-making, and explicit ethical guidelines. Future research will generally focus on enhancing the model's ability to handle multiple inputs, thereby making it more intelligent, safe, and reliable.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet concerns about cultural bias - particularly towards Arabs and Muslims - pose significant ethical challenges by perpetuating harmful stereotypes and marginalization. Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs, prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024 investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming, self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques, creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes while maintaining model utility.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks, overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody, homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations. We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios, introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios. The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable insights for speech model development and evaluation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose PAPO, a novel policy gradient algorithm that encourages the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason. Specifically, we introduce the Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term, which can be seamlessly plugged into mainstream RLVR algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation, reward models, or stronger teacher models. To further enhance the training stability of PAPO, we introduce the Double Entropy Loss, which effectively regularizes the new KL objective without compromising performance. Despite its simplicity, PAPO yields significant overall improvements of 4.4%-17.5% on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more pronounced, approaching 8.0%-19.1%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also observe a substantial reduction of 30.5% in perception errors, indicating improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. Overall, our work introduces a deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into core learning objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages visually grounded reasoning. Code and data will be made publicly available for research purposes. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.

We extend self-attention to take into account text block positions in relative polar coordinate system rather than the Cartesian one. Despite being pre-trained on a dataset more than six times smaller than the widely used IIT-CDIP corpus, DocPolarBERT achieves state-of-the-art results. These results demonstrate that a carefully designed attention mechanism can compensate for reduced pre-training data, offering an efficient and effective alternative for document understanding.

Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs) fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity. Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather than flattening the moral landscape.

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many Indian languages share the same script, making the task even more challenging. Taking all these challenges into account, we develop and release a dataset of 250K sentences consisting of 23 languages including English and all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers, where data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models. Our models outperforms the state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer models for the language identification task. The dataset and the codes are available at https://yashingle-ai.github.io/ILID/ and in Huggingface open source libraries.

Abstract: Exposure to large language model output is rapidly increasing. How will seeing AI-generated ideas affect human ideas? We conducted an experiment (800+ participants, 40+ countries) where participants viewed creative ideas that were from ChatGPT or prior experimental participants and then brainstormed their own idea. We varied the number of AI-generated examples (none, low, or high exposure) and if the examples were labeled as 'AI' (disclosure). Our dynamic experiment design -- ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition -- speaks to the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having LLMs 'in the culture loop'. We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. AI made ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure. We also found that self-reported creative people were less influenced by knowing an idea was from AI and that participants may knowingly adopt AI ideas when the task is difficult. Our findings suggest that introducing AI ideas may increase collective diversity but not individual creativity.

<title>EgoOops: A Dataset for Mistake Action Detection from Egocentric Videos referring to Procedural Texts</title>

Abstract: Mistake action detection is crucial for developing intelligent archives that detect workers' errors and provide feedback. Existing studies have focused on visually apparent mistakes in free-style activities, resulting in video-only approaches to mistake detection. However, in text-following activities, models cannot determine the correctness of some actions without referring to the texts. Additionally, current mistake datasets rarely use procedural texts for video recording except for cooking. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes the EgoOops dataset, where egocentric videos record erroneous activities when following procedural texts across diverse domains. It features three types of annotations: video-text alignment, mistake labels, and descriptions for mistakes. We also propose a mistake detection approach, combining video-text alignment and mistake label classification to leverage the texts. Our experimental results show that incorporating procedural texts is essential for mistake detection. Data is available through https://y-haneji.github.io/EgoOops-project-page/.

Abstract: Language model alignment is a critical step in training modern generative language models. Alignment targets to improve win rate of a sample from the aligned model against the base model. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. For best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, we propose specific transformations offering up to 3-8% improvement on inference-time win rates. Finally, we also show that our proposed reward calibration method is a strong baseline for optimizing standard win rate.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has highlighted the critical roles of both the visual backbone and the underlying language model. While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored. Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets. Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development. Our source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/LLaVA-MORE.

<title>AgentSpec: Customizable Runtime Enforcement for Safe and Reliable LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Agents built on LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, automating complex decision-making and task execution. However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identify 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.

<title>How Can I Publish My LLM Benchmark Without Giving the True Answers Away?</title>

Abstract: Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.

Summary:<br /><br />This article introduces IndoPref, a human-authored multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of text generated by large language models (LLMs). The dataset addresses the underrepresentation of Indonesian language in preference-based research for LLMs. All annotations in IndoPref are in Indonesian, ensuring cultural and linguistic authenticity. The dataset has been evaluated using Krippendorff's alpha, showing strong inter-annotator agreement. Multiple LLMs have been benchmarked using IndoPref to assess the quality of their output. This initiative aims to address the gap in preference-based research for Indonesian language and enhance the performance of LLMs in generating text that is natural and high-quality in Indonesian.

Abstract: Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset specifically designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. All annotations are natively written in Indonesian and evaluated using Krippendorff's alpha, demonstrating strong inter-annotator agreement. Additionally, we benchmark the dataset across multiple LLMs and assess the output quality of each model.

<div> keywords: Large Language Models, benchmarks, persona-based prompting, writing styles, performance evaluation<br />
Summary:<br />
Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) lack writing style diversity, potentially leading to brittle performance. This study explores the impact of persona-based prompting on LLM evaluation. Results show that variations in writing style significantly affect LLM performance. Specific writing styles consistently trigger either low or high performance across models. This method offers a scalable approach to enhance benchmarks, improving the validity of LLM performance assessments across linguistic variations.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs, which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation. Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

Summary:
The article introduces an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies (VFFs) using large language models (LLMs). This pipeline outperforms existing syntactic parsers and allows for rapid and scalable estimation of VFFs. By instructing an LLM to analyze the syntactic structure of sentences containing 476 English verbs, the pipeline generates a new VFF database with broader verb coverage and finer-grained syntactic distinctions. It also provides explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is customizable and extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and languages. The authors release all code and data to support further research in automated frame frequency estimation.

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies (VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames. VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale, accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and release all code and data to support future research.

Summary: 
Media reputation plays a crucial role in attracting venture capital investment for startups. Previous research has focused mainly on general media exposure, but this study introduces the concept of media memorability, which is the ability of media to imprint a startup's name in the memory of investors. Data from 197 UK startups in the micro and nanotechnology sector show that media memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Venture capitalists look for cues such as a startup's distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. Startups should focus on creating targeted, meaningful coverage that highlights their uniqueness and relevance within the industry conversation to strengthen brand memorability and attract investment. This research contributes to understanding the relationship between media, entrepreneurial finance, and startup funding decisions.

Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.

Summary:
- Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure that predicts how difficult it is to process a word before encountering it.
- Recent studies have explored the impact of entropy on language processing, in addition to surprisal effects.
- Entropy is often estimated based on the probability of a word's first subword token, leading to underestimation and potential distortion of true word entropy.
- Monte Carlo (MC) estimates of word entropy, allowing words to span multiple tokens, provide a more accurate measure.
- Regression experiments on reading times reveal differences between first-token and MC word entropy, cautioning against relying solely on first-token approximations for contextual entropy analysis.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated difficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC) estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens. Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using first-token approximations of contextual entropy.

Summary:<br />
Preference-learning methods in machine translation, such as Direct Preference Optimization, have shown impressive results but struggle with generalization. The novel framework proposed, Reinforcement Learning from Teacher-Model Refinement, eliminates reliance on static triplets by utilizing continuous feedback from an external teacher model. By framing each translation step as a micro-tutorial and rewarding the actor based on alignment with the teacher's refinement, the model learns to emulate the teacher's improvements incrementally. Guided by negative edit distance and COMET score, the actor improves both lexical and structural fidelity and semantic adequacy. On the FLORES-200 benchmark, RLfR outperforms MT-SFT and preference-based baselines, showing significant enhancements in COMET and M-ETA scores. <div>

Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance, promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher, mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement. On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy) and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

Summary: This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) represent English dative constructions using Pythia-1.4B. By analyzing a dataset of varied sentence pairs, it is found that LLMs' internal representations reflect the function-infused gradience proposed by the usage-based constructionist approach. The separability between construction representations in LLMs is influenced by gradient preference strength, with more prototypical exemplars occupying distinct regions in the activation space. These results demonstrate that LLMs learn rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and support geometric measures of basic constructionist principles within LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2507.22286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience. We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions (Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of $5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.

Summary: 
Intent recognition is crucial for task-oriented dialogue systems (TODS), but it often requires a large amount of annotated data. This work introduces a hybrid approach that combines BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot settings to recognize intents and detect out-of-scope (OOS) utterances. By leveraging the generalization power of LLMs and computational efficiency of BERT, the proposed method improves system performance on multi-party conversation corpora. The approach involves sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs, resulting in enhanced performance in intent recognition and OOS detection within TODS. <div>

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However, traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system performance improvement.

These findings offer a pathway for improving the robustness of neural models in handling complex reasoning tasks involving negation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions; (2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel personality assessment framework called Traits Run Deep, which utilizes psychology-informed prompts to extract high-level personality-relevant semantic representations. This framework includes a Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network that integrates asynchronous signals from various modalities. It incorporates a Chunk-Wise Projector for dimensionality reduction, a Cross-Modal Connector, and a Text Feature Enhancer for modality fusion, and an ensemble regression head for improved generalization. By guiding large language models using personality-specific prompts, the framework enhances representation quality. Additionally, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features further improves accuracy. Experimental results show a significant reduction in mean squared error and the framework ranks first in the Personality Assessment track of the AVI Challenge 2025.

Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called \textit{\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs \textit{\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a \textit{\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality. Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e., approximately a 45\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority, ranking first in the Personality Assessment track.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations, and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks. We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone. Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and future research.

Summary:
The Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmark, commonly used to test Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts, may overestimate their true capability. A new benchmark, NeedleChain, is proposed where the context consists entirely of query-relevant information, challenging LLMs to fully grasp the input. The benchmark allows for flexible context length and reasoning order, providing a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance. An approach called ROPE Contraction is introduced to enhance LLMs' long-context understanding. Experiments with various advanced LLMs reveal discrepancies between their ability to process large contexts and their capacity to truly understand them. The findings suggest the need for improved evaluation methods for assessing LLMs' long-context understanding. Source code and datasets for NeedleChain are available for further research and analysis.

Abstract: The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance. Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them.

<div> culture, language model, narrative bias, AI-generated narratives, cultural alignment
<br />
The study investigates the cultural relevance of stories generated by a language model trained on Anglo-American texts for different nationalities. Using OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model, the researchers generated 11,800 stories for 236 countries, finding that while the stories incorporate surface-level national symbols, they largely follow a uniform plot structure centered around nostalgia, tradition, and community events. This narrative homogeneity, characterized by sanitized conflicts and a lack of romantic elements, reflects a bias towards stability over change and tradition over growth. The authors argue that this structural conformity represents a distinct form of AI bias, impacting efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI. The findings have implications for literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, and NLP research.

Abstract: Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated 11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a 1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events. Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models (LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1 is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024. These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks, instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license, underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.

<div> large language models, abstract reasoners, zero-shot performance, input encoding, fine-tuning
Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have been criticized for their poor zero-shot performance on challenging tasks, leading to debates about their ability to serve as abstract reasoners. The study shows that even minimal parameter tuning for input encoding can significantly improve LLMs' performance on tasks. However, despite this improvement, the fine-tuning does not consistently transfer across different datasets. These findings suggest the need to reconsider the definition of "abstract reasoner" and the significance of LLMs fitting this description. The discussion surrounding LLMs' capabilities raises questions about the underlying mechanisms driving their performance and challenges the assumptions about their ability to reason abstractly. The study offers insights into the complexities of interpreting LLMs' performance and highlights the importance of understanding the limitations and strengths of these models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has argued that large language models (LLMs) are not "abstract reasoners", citing their poor zero-shot performance on a variety of challenging tasks as evidence. We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an "abstract reasoner", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces forward and backward constraints generation to enhance the instruction-following capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation tasks. It presents IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark with 1.6K test samples across seven programming languages, evaluating correctness and instruction-following separately. Experiments on over 40 LLMs show that closed-source models outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation. However, there is a notable disparity between the models' ability to generate correct code and code that precisely adheres to provided instructions. The paper underscores the importance of aligning code outputs with detailed requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints beyond mere correctness. <div>

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code; however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints, beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics: correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus code that precisely follows instructions.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) excel in translating natural language questions into SQL queries, while small language models (SLMs) struggle due to limited logical reasoning abilities. This study explores enhancing SLM performance in Text-to-SQL tasks through post-training techniques. The researchers leverage the SynSQL-2.5M dataset to create two derived datasets for SQL generation and revision. By employing supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training on SLMs, followed by a corrective self-consistency approach during inference, significant improvements are achieved. Experimentally, the SLM-SQL method demonstrates effectiveness and generalizability, with models reaching up to 67.08% execution accuracy on the BIRD development set. The release of the dataset, model, and code on GitHub offers valuable resources for further research in this domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). In contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy (EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset, model, and code to github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/slm_sql.

CliCARE transforms unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHRs) into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range dependencies and aligns these with normative guideline knowledge graphs for decision support. The framework provides evidence-grounded decision support by generating clinical summaries and actionable recommendations for oncologists. Validation using diverse datasets demonstrated that CliCARE outperforms strong baseline methods and shows high correlation with expert oncologists' assessments. Overall, CliCARE offers promise in enhancing clinical decision support in oncology by effectively utilizing LLMs and incorporating clinical guidelines for improved decision-making.

arXiv:2507.22533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex, longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph. This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation. We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol, which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert oncologists.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential for Question Answering (QA) systems, improving efficiency and reducing human workload in customer service. The emergence of Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However, domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios. We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11 lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ura-hcmut/Vietnamese-Customer-Support-QA.

Summary:
ControlMed is a new medical language model designed to enhance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency in clinical decision-making. It allows users to actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through fine-grained control markers. The model is trained through a three-stage pipeline, including pre-training on a synthetic medical instruction dataset, supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data, and reinforcement learning to improve accuracy and response quality. Experimental results show that ControlMed performs similarly or better than existing models on English and Korean medical benchmarks. Users can adjust reasoning length to balance accuracy and efficiency as needed, making ControlMed a practical solution for clinical question answering and medical information analysis.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support. Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2) supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for clinical question answering and medical information analysis.

CognitiveAttack introduces a new red-teaming framework that leverages individual and combined cognitive biases to bypass safety mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs). By integrating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates optimized prompts that successfully attack LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate vulnerabilities in 30 LLMs, particularly open-source models, with CognitiveAttack outperforming the state-of-the-art black-box method PAP. The study highlights the power of multi-bias interactions as a significant yet underexplored attack vector in undermining LLM safeguards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models. CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety, paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

<div> Language-specific neurons, amplification, multilingual behavior, low-resource languages, cross-lingual transfer
Summary:
Language-specific neurons in large language models (LLMs) can influence model behavior by deactivating them, but their role in amplification is not well understood. This study explores amplifying language-specific neurons across 18 languages, including low-resource languages, using three different models. The amplification factors are evaluated based on their effectiveness in steering output towards the target language, and tested on various downstream tasks. The results show that optimal amplification factors can effectively steer output towards different languages but may not always improve cross-language performance. This highlights the importance of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, with amplification potentially benefitting low-resource languages more than cross-lingual transfer tasks.

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them. However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge (Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

<div> advancement, Large Language Models, Arabic, benchmark, BALSAM

Summary: 
The article discusses the disparity in the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English compared to Arabic, attributed to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic, and benchmark quality. To address these challenges, the authors introduce BALSAM, a community-driven benchmark for Arabic LLM development and evaluation. BALSAM comprises 78 NLP tasks from 14 categories, with 52K examples for testing and development. It offers a centralized platform for blind evaluation and aims to set standards and foster collaborative research to enhance Arabic LLM capabilities. <div>

Abstract: The impressive advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English has not been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps. In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

Summary:<br />
Large language models exhibit strong multilingual abilities, with language-specific neurons identified across 21 languages. These neurons cluster in deeper layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Language arithmetics are used to steer models towards desired language behavior, outperforming simpler approaches. Interventions effectively guide behavior across multilingual tasks, with manipulation more successful for high-resource languages. Typological similarity improves effectiveness, and cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream performance. Internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection are revealed as neurons are progressively deactivated. The code is publicly available for access. <div>
arXiv:2507.22608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of linguistic proximity.
  Through language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing, translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness. We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream performance and reveal internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection when neurons are progressively deactivated.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, political biases, ideological positions, multilingual settings, manipulability

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly utilized in various applications, raising concerns about their potential political biases. Previous studies have shown that LLMs tend to exhibit political biases, often leaning towards liberal or progressive positions. This study addresses gaps in existing research by conducting a large-scale analysis of political orientation in modern open-source LLMs across different languages. The results indicate that larger models tend to shift towards libertarian-left positions, with variations observed across languages and model families. Additionally, the study demonstrates that political stances of LLMs can be manipulated using a center-of-mass activation intervention technique, allowing for the steering of model responses towards alternative ideological positions in various languages. The code used in the study is publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday tools and applications, raising concerns about their potential influence on political views. While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings. Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.
  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative ideological positions across multiple languages. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/d-gurgurov/Political-Ideologies-LLMs.

Abstract: Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates' suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores ``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three} modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and \textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview performance assessment.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a novel framework called TIRESRAG-R1 that aims to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models by addressing three main failure patterns in existing models. The framework utilizes a think-retrieve-reflect process along with a multi-dimensional reward system to improve reasoning and stability. It includes sufficiency rewards to encourage thorough retrieval of information, reasoning quality rewards to assess the rationality and accuracy of reasoning chains, and reflection rewards to detect and revise errors. Additionally, TIRESRAG-R1 implements a difficulty-aware reweighting strategy and training sample filtering to improve performance on complex tasks. Experimental results on multiple question-answering datasets demonstrate that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms previous retrieval-augmented generation methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality. This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o have shown proficiency in generating human-like text but often produce factually incorrect statements, known as 'hallucinations'. A study examined conversational data in Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin to analyze errors in LLMs including GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen-3. Results revealed that Mandarin had the fewest hallucinations while Hindi and Farsi exhibited significantly more. Identifying and addressing hallucinations are crucial for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs across languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as 'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.

Summary: 
- Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for generating text with impressive performance.
- Token-level representations in LLMs capture rich semantics but lose information when pooled into text embeddings.
- Non-generative tasks like clustering, classification, and retrieval require accurate sentence- or document-level embeddings.
- Adaptation strategies for pre-trained LLMs include aggregation techniques for token embeddings, task-specific prompt engineering, and contrastive fine-tuning for text-level augmentation.
- By combining these strategies, the study achieves state-of-the-art results on English clustering in the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB).
- Analysis of the attention map shows that fine-tuning focuses on relevant words, improving compression of meaning in the final hidden state.
- Experiments show that LLMs can be effectively adapted as text embedding models using prompt engineering and contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically generated positive pairs.

arXiv:2507.22729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However, pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information. Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering, classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and (iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically generated positive pairs.

<div> hallucinations, abstractive summarization, reward-driven fine-tuning, Entity Hallucination Index, reinforcement learning

Summary:
In this work, the challenge of reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization is addressed through a reward-driven fine-tuning framework. The framework optimizes for the Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric that evaluates the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated summaries. By using reinforcement learning to fine-tune model parameters with EHI as a reward signal, the model generates entity-faithful outputs. The approach does not require human-written factuality annotations, allowing for scalable fine-tuning. Experimental results show consistent improvements in EHI scores across datasets, highlighting a reduction in entity-level hallucinations without compromising fluency or informativeness. The release of a reproducible Colab pipeline enables further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using lightweight metrics like EHI.

Abstract: Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline, facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.

Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia, created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover, apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for open-ended question answering.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a new approach to query-focused table summarization, utilizing structured representations for complex reasoning. The proposed framework, SPaGe, involves three phases: Structured Planning to generate a new structured plan (TaSoF) from a query, Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps to SQL, and Summary Generation for producing query-focused summaries. This structured approach captures complex dependencies, improving reliability and scalability, especially for multi-table tasks. Experimental results show that SPaGe outperforms prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, highlighting the advantages of structured representations in enhancing the robustness and efficiency of table summarization. <div>
arXiv:2507.22829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.

<div> in-context learning, large language models, demos, positional bias, accuracy

Summary:
The study explores a new positional bias in in-context learning (ICL) called DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. It investigates how the position of demos, system prompts, and user messages in large language models (LLMs) affects accuracy and predictions. Two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, are introduced to quantify the impact of changes in demo positions. Experiments on ten LLMs across various tasks show that placing demos at the start of the prompt leads to more stable and accurate outputs, with gains of up to +6 points. Placing demos at the end of the user message significantly affects predictions, flipping over 30% without improving correctness on question answering tasks. Smaller models are more sensitive to this bias, but even large models show some impact on more complex tasks. <div>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time: we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks. We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position. Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN, LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast, placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on complex tasks.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models, Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, Multi-modal instructions, Self-correction

Summary: 
Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning (CIMR) is a framework designed to enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in processing complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions. The framework introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and self-correction module, operating in two stages: initial reasoning and response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal feedback. CIMR integrates textual, visual, and contextual features dynamically at each step. By fine-tuning LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluating on the Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset, CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, and InstructBLIP. This demonstrates the effectiveness of CIMR's iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in handling complex tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5 (78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex tasks.

CodeEvo is a framework that leverages collaborative programming practices to synthesize high-quality code data for training Large Language Models (LLMs). It involves iterative interactions between two LLM agents - a Coder and a Reviewer - where the Coder generates code and test cases based on instructions, while the Reviewer provides feedback and new instructions. A hybrid feedback mechanism ensures the quality control by combining compiler determinism with generative flexibility. Experimental results show that models trained on CodeEvo data outperform existing baselines in code generation tasks. The approach emphasizes the importance of code-centric data synthesis and offers insights into effective strategies for generating diverse and relevant code samples. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instruction-code pairs is essential for training Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. Manually curated data is expensive and inherently limited in scale, motivating the development of code-centric synthesis methods. Yet, current approaches either focus on augmenting existing code or rely on predefined heuristics, both lacking rigorous data validation, which results in synthetic data that is ungrounded, repetitive, or overly simplistic. Inspired by collaborative programming practices, we propose CodeEvo, a framework that synthesizes code data through iterative interactions between two LLM agents: a Coder, which generates candidate code and test cases based on given instructions, and a Reviewer, which guides the synthesis process by producing new instructions and feedback. We further introduce a hybrid feedback mechanism that combines compiler determinism with the generative flexibility of agents, enabling automatic quality control throughout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data significantly outperform established baselines across code generation benchmarks with various difficulties. In-depth analyses further provide insights from multiple perspectives into effective code-centric data synthesis.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a method for optimizing attack generator prompts using the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for individual attacks. By measuring the discoverability of each attack through multiple attempts against a randomly seeded target, exploitable patterns are revealed. This approach enhances the evaluation and refinement of attack generators by ensuring a more robust assessment of their effectiveness. Automated Red Teaming with Large Language Models (LLMs) is a growing trend in identifying system vulnerabilities, making the optimization of attack generators crucial. The evaluation of attack generators using ASR on individual attacks provides insights into their discoverability and effectiveness. By iterating attacks against randomly seeded targets, exploitable patterns can be detected, leading to improved prompt optimization. This method allows for a more comprehensive evaluation and refinement process, ultimately enhancing the overall security of target systems. <div>

Abstract: Applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming widespread, making the identification of system vulnerabilities increasingly important. Automated Red Teaming accelerates this effort by using an LLM to generate and execute attacks against target systems. Attack generators are evaluated using the Attack Success Rate (ASR) the sample mean calculated over the judgment of success for each attack. In this paper, we introduce a method for optimizing attack generator prompts that applies ASR to individual attacks. By repeating each attack multiple times against a randomly seeded target, we measure an attack's discoverability the expectation of the individual attack success. This approach reveals exploitable patterns that inform prompt optimization, ultimately enabling more robust evaluation and refinement of generators.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, security, jailbreaking attacks, logit-level attacks, defense 

Summary: 
The article discusses the importance of ensuring the security of Large Language Models (LLMs) against jailbreaking attacks, particularly in critical areas where these models are increasingly being adopted. Traditional defenses against malicious prompts may not be sufficient, as recent logit-level attacks have demonstrated the ability to manipulate token-selection processes. In response to these advanced attacks, Strategic Deflection (SDeflection) is proposed as a defense mechanism that redirects the model's response to neutralize harmful intents rather than outright refusing them. Experimental results show that SDeflection effectively lowers Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining model performance on benign queries. This approach represents a significant shift in defensive strategies, moving towards strategic content redirection to mitigate advanced threats.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical areas, ensuring their security against jailbreaking attacks is paramount. While traditional defenses primarily rely on refusing malicious prompts, recent logit-level attacks have demonstrated the ability to bypass these safeguards by directly manipulating the token-selection process during generation. We introduce Strategic Deflection (SDeflection), a defense that redefines the LLM's response to such advanced attacks. Instead of outright refusal, the model produces an answer that is semantically adjacent to the user's request yet strips away the harmful intent, thereby neutralizing the attacker's harmful intent. Our experiments demonstrate that SDeflection significantly lowers Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining model performance on benign queries. This work presents a critical shift in defensive strategies, moving from simple refusal to strategic content redirection to neutralize advanced threats.

<div> systematicity, explainability, AI models, connectionism, Fodorian<br />
<br />Summary: This paper argues that explainability is just one aspect of a broader ideal guiding our expectations of artificial intelligence (AI). The focus is on the extent to which AI demonstrates systematicity, not only in understanding how thoughts are composed but also in striving toward a consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled body of thought. The author presents a framework to define "the systematicity of thought" in four distinct senses to address challenges posed by connectionism. The conceptual framework aims to reconcile systematicity with connectionism and explores the historical notion of systematic thought informed by rationales for systematization. The paper identifies five rationales for systematization and examines their applicability to AI models, introducing the "hard systematicity challenge." The dynamic understanding of systematization helps determine the level of systematicity required in AI models based on the reasons for systematizing thought. <div>
arXiv:2507.22197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI). Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the "systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed "the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational, authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic we need AI models to be and when.

<div> Hierarchy, CoEx, LLM, world model, planning <br />
Summary: <br />
The article discusses the limitations of current LLM agents in effectively assimilating new observations into their static internal world models for planning. To address this issue, the authors propose a hierarchical agent architecture called CoEx. This architecture utilizes hierarchical state abstraction to allow LLM planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx employs LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic plans involving subgoals, continuously integrating these experiences into a neurosymbolic belief state. The agent is evaluated across various scenarios, demonstrating superior performance in planning and exploration compared to existing paradigms. Through experiments in diverse environments and complex tasks, including ALFWorld, PDDL, and Jericho, CoEx showcases its ability to generate effective plans and interact with the world in a more adaptive and efficient manner. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld, PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent paradigms in planning and exploration.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task. Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination, black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm, LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently, and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria: dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit ''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high consistency (robustness).

Tokenization is a key aspect in natural language processing and other sequence modeling fields, with vocabulary size playing a significant role in model performance. This study introduces a systematic approach to determining the optimal vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions based on Zipf's law. The research demonstrates a correlation between downstream task performance and adherence to power-law behavior, highlighting the benefits of aligning with Zipfian scaling for enhancing model efficiency and effectiveness. Through extensive experiments in various domains such as NLP, genomics, and chemistry, the study establishes Zipfian alignment as a reliable and broadly applicable criterion for selecting vocabulary size. <div>

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.

Summary:<br />
The article addresses the challenge of balancing data privacy and model utility when training large language models on sensitive datasets, particularly in healthcare. Traditional differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) methods suffer from a trade-off between privacy and accuracy due to gradient clipping and noise perturbation. The proposed framework, RLDP, leverages deep reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust per-parameter gradient-clipping thresholds and noise levels during model training. Through extensive experiments on various language models, RLDP demonstrates significant improvements in model performance, achieving up to 30.5% perplexity reduction and 5.6% downstream utility gain while maintaining privacy guarantees. The framework also shows faster convergence, requiring only a fraction of the gradient-update budget compared to baseline methods, and exhibits resilience against privacy attacks. RLDP presents a promising approach to enhancing the utility of language models while preserving data privacy. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.22565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise, degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Dragon-FM is a novel text-to-speech (TTS) model that combines the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models. It processes audio codec tokens at a fast rate of 12.5 tokens per second, allowing for efficient generation of high-quality content. The model utilizes autoregressive modeling across chunks for global coherence and parallel flow-matching within chunks for fast denoising. By incorporating key-value caching and future context within each chunk, Dragon-FM addresses the limitations of both diffusion and autoregressive models. It also bridges the gap between continuous and discrete feature modeling, showcasing the ability to predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. The model's efficient codec and architecture make it particularly effective for generating extended content like zero-shot podcasts. Experiment demos on podcast datasets have shown the model's capability to generate high-quality content efficiently.

Abstract: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact 12.5 tokens per second rate. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Consequently, the proposed model can utilize KV-cache across chunks and incorporate future context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also makes the proposed model particularly effective for generating extended content. Experiment for demos of our work} on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

Summary:
GeoOutageKG is a new multimodal knowledge graph designed for detecting, analyzing, and predicting power outages, particularly during extreme weather events like hurricanes. By combining diverse data sources such as nighttime light satellite images, spatiotemporal power outage maps, and county-level outage reports, GeoOutageKG provides a comprehensive and detailed representation of power outages in the United States. With over 10.6 million outage records, 300,000 NTL images, and 15,000 outage maps integrated into the knowledge graph, GeoOutageKG offers a robust platform for analyzing power outages at different spatial and temporal resolutions. Its modular and reusable structure enables efficient data integration and supports multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power outages. <div>

Abstract: Detecting, analyzing, and predicting power outages is crucial for grid risk assessment and disaster mitigation. Numerous outages occur each year, exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image data provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events. However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology, GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from 2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and reusable semantic resource that enables robust multimodal data integration. We demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power outages.

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful applications of artificial intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants, and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e., optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent. This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole recommendation ecosystem.
  To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App. Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions. These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually beneficial recommendation ecosystem.

<title>Towards the Law of Capacity Gap in Distilling Language Models</title>

Abstract: Language model (LM) distillation aims at distilling the knowledge in a large teacher LM to a small student one. As a critical issue facing LM distillation, a superior student often arises from a teacher of a relatively small scale instead of a larger one, especially in the presence of substantial capacity gap between the teacher and student. This issue, often referred to as the \textit{curse of capacity gap}, suggests that there is likely an optimal teacher yielding the best-performing student along the scaling course of the teacher. Consequently, distillation trials on teachers of a wide range of scales are called for to determine the optimal teacher, which becomes computationally intensive in the context of large LMs (LLMs). This paper addresses this critical bottleneck by providing the \textit{law of capacity gap} inducted from a preliminary study on distilling a broad range of small-scale (<3B) LMs, where the optimal teacher consistently scales linearly with the student scale across different model and data scales. By extending the law to LLM distillation on a larger scale (7B), we succeed in obtaining versatile LLMs that outperform a wide array of competitors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results on machine translation for high resource language pairs and domains. However, in specialised domains (e.g. medical) LLMs have shown lower performance compared to standard neural machine translation models. The consistency in the machine translation of terminology is crucial for users, researchers, and translators in specialised domains. In this study, we compare the performance between baseline LLMs and instruction-tuned LLMs in the medical domain. In addition, we introduce terminology from specialised medical dictionaries into the instruction formatted datasets for fine-tuning LLMs. The instruction-tuned LLMs significantly outperform the baseline models with automatic metrics.

Abstract: Historical analogies, which compare known past events with contemporary but unfamiliar events, are important abilities that help people make decisions and understand the world. However, research in applied history suggests that people have difficulty finding appropriate analogies. And previous studies in the AI community have also overlooked historical analogies. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on the historical analogy acquisition task, which aims to acquire analogous historical events for a given event. We explore retrieval and generation methods for acquiring historical analogies based on different large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, we propose a self-reflection method to mitigate hallucinations and stereotypes when LLMs generate historical analogies. Through human evaluations and our specially designed automatic multi-dimensional assessment, we find that LLMs generally have a good potential for historical analogies. And the performance of the models can be further improved by using our self-reflection method.

Abstract: We address the problem of extending a pretrained large language model to a new domain that was not seen during training. Standard techniques, such as finetuning or low-rank adaptation (LoRA) are successful at domain adaptation, but do not formally add capacity to the model. This often leads to a trade-off, between performing well on the new domain vs. degrading performance on the original domain. Here, we revisit and improve adapters to extend LLMs from three angles: data, architecture and training procedure, which are advantageously considered jointly. The resulting method, called neutral residues, modifies adapters in a way that leads each new residual block to output near-zeros on the original domain. This solution leads to strong results when adapting a state-of-the-art model originally trained on English to a new language. Neutral residues significantly outperform competing approaches such as finetuning, LoRA or vanilla adapters in terms of the trade-off between learning the new language and not forgetting English.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is revolutionising the way both professionals and laypersons operate in the legal field. The considerable potential for NLP in the legal sector, especially in developing computational assistance tools for various legal processes, has captured the interest of researchers for years. This survey follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses framework, reviewing 154 studies, with a final selection of 131 after manual filtering. It explores foundational concepts related to NLP in the legal domain, illustrating the unique aspects and challenges of processing legal texts, such as extensive document lengths, complex language, and limited open legal datasets. We provide an overview of NLP tasks specific to legal text, such as Document Summarisation, Named Entity Recognition, Question Answering, Argument Mining, Text Classification, and Judgement Prediction. Furthermore, we analyse both developed legal-oriented language models, and approaches for adapting general-purpose language models to the legal domain. Additionally, we identify sixteen open research challenges, including the detection and mitigation of bias in artificial intelligence applications, the need for more robust and interpretable models, and improving explainability to handle the complexities of legal language and reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents Yankari, a large-scale monolingual dataset for the Yoruba language, aimed at addressing the critical gap in Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources for this important West African language. Despite being spoken by over 30 million people, Yoruba has been severely underrepresented in NLP research and applications. We detail our methodology for creating this dataset, which includes careful source selection, automated quality control, and rigorous data cleaning processes. The Yankari dataset comprises 51,407 documents from 13 diverse sources, totaling over 30 million tokens. Our approach focuses on ethical data collection practices, avoiding problematic sources and addressing issues prevalent in existing datasets. We provide thorough automated evaluations of the dataset, demonstrating its quality compared to existing resources. The Yankari dataset represents a significant advancement in Yoruba language resources, providing a foundation for developing more accurate NLP models, supporting comparative linguistic studies, and contributing to the digital accessibility of the Yoruba language.

Abstract: Continual learning remains a challenge across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as models updated with new training data often risk catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. We introduce a discrete key-value bottleneck (DKVB) for encoder-only language models, enabling efficient continual learning through localized updates. Inspired by a discrete key-value bottleneck in vision, we consider new and NLP-specific challenges. We compare different bottleneck architectures for NLP and introduce a new, task-independent initialization technique for the discrete keys. We evaluate our DKVB for NLP in four continual learning scenarios and show that it alleviates catastrophic forgetting. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance compared to popular continual learning methods while incurring lower computational costs. Furthermore, we show that DKVB remains effective even in challenging single-head continual learning scenarios where no task ID is provided.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional versatility across domains, including applications to electrocardiograms (ECGs). A growing body of work focuses on generating text from multi-channeled ECG signals and corresponding textual prompts. Existing approaches often involve a two-stage process: pretraining an ECG-specific encoder with a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective, followed by finetuning an LLM for natural language generation (NLG) using encoder-derived features. However, these methods face two key limitations: inefficiency due to multi-stage training and challenges in interpreting encoder-generated features. To overcome these issues, we propose ECG-Byte, an adapted byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer pipeline for autoregressive language modeling of ECGs. ECG-Byte compresses and encodes ECG signals into tokens, enabling direct end-to-end LLM training by combining ECG and text tokens. This approach enhances interpretability, as ECG tokens can be directly mapped back to the original signals. Leveraging ECG-Byte, we achieve competitive NLG performance while training 3 times faster and using just 48\% of the data required by traditional two-stage methods.

<title>Modeling Story Expectations to Understand Engagement: A Generative Framework Using LLMs</title>

Abstract: Understanding when and why consumers engage with stories is crucial for content creators and platforms. While existing theories suggest that audience beliefs of what is going to happen should play an important role in engagement decisions, empirical work has mostly focused on developing techniques to directly extract features from actual content, rather than capturing forward-looking beliefs, due to the lack of a principled way to model such beliefs in unstructured narrative data. To complement existing feature extraction techniques, this paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models to model audience forward-looking beliefs about how stories might unfold. Our method generates multiple potential continuations for each story and extracts features related to expectations, uncertainty, and surprise using established content analysis techniques. Applying our method to over 30,000 book chapters, we demonstrate that our framework complements existing feature engineering techniques by amplifying their marginal explanatory power on average by 31%. The results reveal that different types of engagement-continuing to read, commenting, and voting-are driven by distinct combinations of current and anticipated content features. Our framework provides a novel way to study and explore how audience forward-looking beliefs shape their engagement with narrative media, with implications for marketing strategy in content-focused industries.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). Despite the encouraging results of previous studies, prior methods prompt LLMs to predict answers directly, neglecting intermediate thought processes. We argue that prior methods do not sufficiently activate the capacities of LLMs. We propose a framework called PLRH that Prompts LLMs with Rationale Heuristics for knowledge-based VQA. The PLRH prompts LLMs with Chain of Thought (CoT) to generate rationale heuristics, i.e., intermediate thought processes, and then leverages the rationale heuristics to inspire LLMs to predict answers. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the existing baselines by more than 2.2 and 2.1 on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical applications such as disease diagnosis and treatment planning. However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the deep reasoning required for complex medical problems, such as differential diagnosis and medication recommendations. We propose FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality medical synthetic data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduce Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also propose a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity. The project and data will be released on GitHub.

Abstract: Data quantity and quality play a vital role in determining the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). High-quality data, in particular, can significantly boost the LLM's ability to generalize on a wide range of downstream tasks. Large pre-training datasets for leading LLMs remain inaccessible to the public, whereas many open datasets are small in size (less than 5 trillion tokens), limiting their suitability for training large models.
  In this paper, we introduce GneissWeb, a large dataset yielding around 10 trillion tokens that caters to the data quality and quantity requirements of training LLMs. Our GneissWeb recipe that produced the dataset consists of sharded exact sub-string deduplication and a judiciously constructed ensemble of quality filters. GneissWeb achieves a favorable trade-off between data quality and quantity, producing models that outperform models trained on state-of-the-art open large datasets (5+ trillion tokens).
  We show that models trained using GneissWeb dataset outperform those trained on FineWeb-V1.1.0 by 2.73 percentage points in terms of average score computed on a set of 11 commonly used benchmarks (both zero-shot and few-shot) for pre-training dataset evaluation. When the evaluation set is extended to 20 benchmarks (both zero-shot and few-shot), models trained using GneissWeb still achieve a 1.75 percentage points advantage over those trained on FineWeb-V1.1.0.

Abstract: Word-level quality estimation (QE) methods aim to detect erroneous spans in machine translations, which can direct and facilitate human post-editing. While the accuracy of word-level QE systems has been assessed extensively, their usability and downstream influence on the speed, quality and editing choices of human post-editing remain understudied. In this study, we investigate the impact of word-level QE on machine translation (MT) post-editing in a realistic setting involving 42 professional post-editors across two translation directions. We compare four error-span highlight modalities, including supervised and uncertainty-based word-level QE methods, for identifying potential errors in the outputs of a state-of-the-art neural MT model. Post-editing effort and productivity are estimated from behavioral logs, while quality improvements are assessed by word- and segment-level human annotation. We find that domain, language and editors' speed are critical factors in determining highlights' effectiveness, with modest differences between human-made and automated QE highlights underlining a gap between accuracy and usability in professional workflows.

Abstract: The ability to extract compact, meaningful summaries from large-scale and multimodal data is critical for numerous applications, ranging from video analytics to medical reports. Prior methods in cross-modal summarization have often suffered from high computational overheads and limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a \textit{Cross-Modal State-Space Graph Reasoning} (\textbf{CSS-GR}) framework that incorporates a state-space model with graph-based message passing, inspired by prior work on efficient state-space models. Unlike existing approaches relying on purely sequential models, our method constructs a graph that captures inter- and intra-modal relationships, allowing more holistic reasoning over both textual and visual streams. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves summarization quality and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency, as validated on standard multimodal summarization benchmarks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to highlight the contributions of each component.

Abstract: While the inconsistency of LLMs is not a novel topic, prior research has predominantly addressed two types of generative inconsistencies: i) Randomness Inconsistency: running the same LLM multiple trials, yielding varying responses; ii) Paraphrase Inconsistency: paraphrased prompts result in different responses from the same LLM. Randomness Inconsistency arises from the inherent randomness due to stochastic sampling in generative models, while Paraphrase Inconsistency is a consequence of the language modeling objectives, where paraphrased prompts alter the distribution of vocabulary logits. This research discovers Prompt-Reverse Inconsistency (PRIN), a new form of LLM self-inconsistency: given a question and a couple of LLM-generated answer candidates, the LLM often has conflicting responses when prompted "Which are correct answers?" and "Which are incorrect answers?". PRIN poses a big concern as it undermines the credibility of LLM-as-a-judge, and suggests a challenge for LLMs to adhere to basic logical rules. We conduct a series of experiments to investigate PRIN, examining the extent of PRIN across different LLMs, methods to mitigate it, potential applications, and its relationship with Randomness Inconsistency and Paraphrase Inconsistency. As the first study to explore PRIN, our findings offer valuable insights into the inner workings of LLMs and contribute to advancing trustworthy AI.

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-driven tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), is reshaping professional writing. Still, key aspects of their adoption such as languages support, ethics, and long-term impact on writers voice and creativity remain underexplored. In this work, we conducted a questionnaire (N = 301) and an interactive survey (N = 36) targeting professional writers regularly using AI. We examined LLM-assisted writing practices across 25+ languages, ethical concerns, and user expectations. The findings of the survey demonstrate important insights, reflecting upon the importance of: LLMs adoption for non-English speakers; the degree of misinformation, domain and style adaptation; usability and key features of LLMs. These insights can guide further development, benefiting both writers and a broader user base.

Abstract: Generation capabilities and language coverage of multilingual large language models (mLLMs) are advancing rapidly. However, evaluation practices for generative abilities of mLLMs are still lacking comprehensiveness, scientific rigor, and consistent adoption across research labs, which undermines their potential to meaningfully guide mLLM development. We draw parallels with machine translation (MT) evaluation, a field that faced similar challenges and has, over decades, developed transparent reporting standards and reliable evaluations for multilingual generative models. Through targeted experiments across key stages of the generative evaluation pipeline, we demonstrate how best practices from MT evaluation can deepen the understanding of quality differences between models. Additionally, we identify essential components for robust meta-evaluation of mLLMs, ensuring the evaluation methods themselves are rigorously assessed. We distill these insights into a checklist of actionable recommendations for mLLM research and development.

Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics. Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance, specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate real-world use.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a way to complement the in-context knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external documents. However, real-world applications demand not only accuracy but also interpretability. While dense retrieval methods provide high accuracy, they lack interpretability; conversely, sparse retrieval methods offer transparency but often fail to capture the full intent of queries due to their reliance on keyword matching. To address these issues, we introduce IterKey, an LLM-driven iterative keyword generation framework that enhances RAG via sparse retrieval. IterKey consists of three LLM-driven stages: generating keywords for retrieval, generating answers based on retrieved documents, and validating the answers. If validation fails, the process iteratively repeats with refined keywords. Across four QA tasks, experimental results show that IterKey achieves 5% to 20% accuracy improvements over BM25-based RAG and simple baselines. Its performance is comparable to dense retrieval-based RAG and prior iterative query refinement methods using dense models. In summary, IterKey is a novel BM25-based approach leveraging LLMs to iteratively refine RAG, effectively balancing accuracy with interpretability.

Abstract: Traditional dialogue summarization primarily focuses on dialogue content, assuming it comprises adequate information for a clear summary. However, this assumption often fails for discussions grounded in shared background, where participants frequently omit context and use implicit references. This results in summaries that are confusing to readers unfamiliar with the background. To address this, we introduce Knowledge-Grounded Discussion Summarization (KGDS), a novel task that produces a supplementary background summary for context and a clear opinion summary with clarified references. To facilitate research, we construct the first KGDS benchmark, featuring news-discussion pairs and expert-created multi-granularity gold annotations for evaluating sub-summaries. We also propose a novel hierarchical evaluation framework with fine-grained and interpretable metrics. Our extensive evaluation of 12 advanced large language models (LLMs) reveals that KGDS remains a significant challenge. The models frequently miss key facts and retain irrelevant ones in background summarization, and often fail to resolve implicit references in opinion summary integration.

Abstract: Linear concept vectors effectively steer LLMs, but existing methods suffer from noisy features in diverse datasets that undermine steering robustness. We propose Sparse Autoencoder-Denoised Concept Vectors (SDCV), which selectively keep the most discriminative SAE latents while reconstructing hidden representations. Our key insight is that concept-relevant signals can be explicitly separated from dataset noise by scaling up activations of top-k latents that best differentiate positive and negative samples. Applied to linear probing and difference-in-mean, SDCV consistently improves steering success rates by 4-16\% across six challenging concepts, while maintaining topic relevance.

Abstract: Long Context Understanding (LCU) is a critical area for exploration in current large language models (LLMs). However, due to the inherently lengthy nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses. Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237 test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore, our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See https://github.com/MilkThink-Lab/MiniLongBench for our code, data and tutorial.

<title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Bengali Math Word Problem Solving with Chain of Thought Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Solving Bengali Math Word Problems (MWPs) remains a major challenge in natural language processing (NLP) due to the language's low-resource status and the multi-step reasoning required. Existing models struggle with complex Bengali MWPs, largely because no human-annotated Bengali dataset has previously addressed this task. This gap has limited progress in Bengali mathematical reasoning. To address this, we created SOMADHAN, a dataset of 8792 complex Bengali MWPs with manually written, step-by-step solutions. We designed this dataset to support reasoning-focused evaluation and model development in a linguistically underrepresented context. Using SOMADHAN, we evaluated a range of large language models (LLMs) - including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA series models, Deepseek, and Qwen - through both zero-shot and few-shot prompting with and without Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT prompting consistently improved performance over standard prompting, especially in tasks requiring multi-step logic. LLaMA-3.3 70B achieved the highest accuracy of 88% with few-shot CoT prompting. We also applied Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune models efficiently, enabling them to adapt to Bengali MWPs with minimal computational cost. Our work fills a critical gap in Bengali NLP by providing a high-quality reasoning dataset and a scalable framework for solving complex MWPs. We aim to advance equitable research in low-resource languages and enhance reasoning capabilities in educational and language technologies.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning, and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.72 F1. They are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of the figure.

Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300 annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge correctly recognizes instance-specific issues in 2/3 cases and is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports composed by human annotators. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/tunde-ajayi/llm-as-a-qualitative-judge.

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks. Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings. In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to 0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35). Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the trajectory of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the performance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets. By doing so, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the diverse landscape of VLMs. Additionally, we underscore potential avenues for future research in this dynamic domain, anticipating further breakthroughs and advancements.

Abstract: Acoustic context effects, where surrounding changes in pitch, rate or timbre influence the perception of a sound, are well documented in speech perception, but how they interact with language background remains unclear. Using a reverse-correlation approach, we systematically varied the pitch and speech rate in phrases around different pairs of vowels for second language (L2) speakers of English (/i/-/I/) and French (/u/-/y/), thus reconstructing, in a data-driven manner, the prosodic profiles that bias their perception. Testing English and French speakers (n=25), we showed that vowel perception is in fact influenced by conflicting effects from the surrounding pitch and speech rate: a congruent proximal effect 0.2s pre-target and a distal contrastive effect up to 1s before; and found that L1 and L2 speakers exhibited strikingly similar prosodic profiles in perception. We provide a novel method to investigate acoustic context effects across stimuli, timescales, and acoustic domain.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in caption generation, existing evaluation metrics often fail to capture the full quality or fine-grained details of captions. This is mainly due to their reliance on non-specific human-written references or noisy pre-training data. Still, finding an effective metric is crucial not only for captions evaluation but also for the generation phase. Metrics can indeed play a key role in the fine-tuning stage of captioning models, ultimately enhancing the quality of the generated captions. In this paper, we propose PAC-S++, a learnable metric that leverages the CLIP model, pre-trained on both web-collected and cleaned data and regularized through additional pairs of generated visual and textual positive samples. Exploiting this stronger and curated pre-training, we also apply PAC-S++ as a reward in the Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) stage typically employed to fine-tune captioning models. Extensive experiments on different image and video datasets highlight the effectiveness of PAC-S++ compared to popular metrics for the task, including its sensitivity to object hallucinations. Furthermore, we show that integrating PAC-S++ into the fine-tuning stage of a captioning model results in semantically richer captions with fewer repetitions and grammatical errors. Evaluations on out-of-domain benchmarks further demonstrate the efficacy of our fine-tuning approach in enhancing model capabilities. Source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/pacscore.

Abstract: Attributing outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) in adversarial settings-such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns-presents significant challenges that are likely to grow in importance. We approach this attribution problem from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective, drawing on formal language theory (identification in the limit) and data-driven analysis of the expanding LLM ecosystem. By modeling an LLM's set of possible outputs as a formal language, we analyze whether finite samples of text can uniquely pinpoint the originating model. Our results show that, under mild assumptions of overlapping capabilities among models, certain classes of LLMs are fundamentally non-identifiable from their outputs alone. We delineate four regimes of theoretical identifiability: (1) an infinite class of deterministic (discrete) LLM languages is not identifiable (Gold's classical result from 1967); (2) an infinite class of probabilistic LLMs is also not identifiable (by extension of the deterministic case); (3) a finite class of deterministic LLMs is identifiable (consistent with Angluin's tell-tale criterion); and (4) even a finite class of probabilistic LLMs can be non-identifiable (we provide a new counterexample establishing this negative result). Complementing these theoretical insights, we quantify the explosion in the number of plausible model origins (hypothesis space) for a given output in recent years. Even under conservative assumptions-each open-source model fine-tuned on at most one new dataset-the count of distinct candidate models doubles approximately every 0.5 years, and allowing multi-dataset fine-tuning combinations yields doubling times as short as 0.28 years. This combinatorial growth, alongside the extraordinary computational cost of brute-force likelihood attribution across all models and potential users, renders exhaustive attribution infeasible in practice.

Abstract: Synthetic verification techniques such as generating test cases and reward modelling are common ways to enhance the coding capabilities of large language models (LLM) beyond predefined tests. Additionally, code verification has recently found great success as a critical component in improving reasoning capability of LLMs via reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose an approach which can transform existing coding benchmarks into scoring and ranking datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic verifiers. We also propose multiple metrics to measure different aspects of the synthetic verifiers with the proposed benchmarks. By employing the proposed approach, we release four new benchmarks (HE-R, HE-R+, MBPP-R, and MBPP-R+), and analyzed synthetic verification methods with standard, reasoning-based, and reward-based LLMs. Our experiments show that reasoning can significantly improve test case generation and that scaling the number of test cases enhances the verification accuracy.

Abstract: We present a challenging benchmark for the Open WorLd VISual question answering (OWLViz) task. OWLViz presents concise, unambiguous queries that require integrating multiple capabilities, including visual understanding, web exploration, and specialized tool usage. While humans achieve 69.2% accuracy on these intuitive tasks, even state-of-the-art VLMs struggle, with the best model, Gemini 2.0, achieving only 26.6% accuracy. Current agentic VLMs, which rely on limited vision and vision-language models as tools, perform even worse. This performance gap reveals significant limitations in multimodal systems' ability to select appropriate tools and execute complex reasoning sequences, establishing new directions for advancing practical AI research.

Abstract: Text-driven speech style transfer aims to mold the intonation, pace, and timbre of a spoken utterance to match stylistic cues from text descriptions. While existing methods leverage large-scale neural architectures or pre-trained language models, the computational costs often remain high. In this paper, we present \emph{ReverBERT}, an efficient framework for text-driven speech style transfer that draws inspiration from a state space model (SSM) paradigm, loosely motivated by the image-based method of Wang and Liu~\cite{wang2024stylemamba}. Unlike image domain techniques, our method operates in the speech space and integrates a discrete Fourier transform of latent speech features to enable smooth and continuous style modulation. We also propose a novel \emph{Transformer-based SSM} layer for bridging textual style descriptors with acoustic attributes, dramatically reducing inference time while preserving high-quality speech characteristics. Extensive experiments on benchmark speech corpora demonstrate that \emph{ReverBERT} significantly outperforms baselines in terms of naturalness, expressiveness, and computational efficiency. We release our model and code publicly to foster further research in text-driven speech style transfer.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models are accelerating the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents that utilize human-like vision perception capabilities to enhance productivity on digital devices. Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation. In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding. We will release corresponding artifacts at https://microsoft.github.io/FIVE-UI-Evol/ .

<title>Enhancing Ultra-Low-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models Through Saliency-Aware Partial Retraining</title>

Abstract: The growing use of large language models has raised environmental and economic concerns about their intensity of resource usage during inference. Serving these models to each user requires substantial energy and water for cooling. Model compression techniques like quantization can shrink large language models and make them more resource efficient at the cost of potential performance degradation. Quantization methods compress model size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through full retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This gain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. This publicly available method relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on LLaMA 7B and 13B benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces the ApiQ's accuracy degradation by 10.85% and 7.54% respectively. A Python implementation of the proposed quantization method is publicly available on GitHub https://github.com/TokuyuSou/ULB-SAPR.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has emerged as a crucial research direction, as integrating textual and visual information can substantially enhance performance in tasks such as classification, retrieval, and scene understanding. Despite advances with large pre-trained models, existing approaches often suffer from insufficient cross-modal interactions and rigid fusion strategies, failing to fully harness the complementary strengths of different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Co-AttenDWG, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and expert fusion. Our approach first projects textual and visual features into a shared embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention mechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities. This is further strengthened by a dimension-wise gating network, which adaptively modulates feature contributions at the channel level to emphasize salient information. In parallel, dual-path encoders independently refine modality-specific representations, while an additional cross-attention layer aligns the modalities further. The resulting features are aggregated via an expert fusion module that integrates learned gating and self-attention, yielding a robust unified representation. Experimental results on the MIMIC and SemEval Memotion 1.0 datasets show that Co-AttenDWG achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior cross-modal alignment, highlighting its effectiveness for diverse multi-modal applications.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to generalize across domains and tasks. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a recent study explored the integration of HGNNs with LLMs for generalizable heterogeneous graph learning. However, this approach typically encodes structural information as HG tokens using HGNNs, and disparities in embedding spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension of HGs. Moreover, since these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks, the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent cloze-style 'mask' token prediction paradigm. Specifically,MLM4HG first converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover, the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/MLM4HG.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models show difficulty perception misaligned with human intuition, exhibit dramatic 2Dto-3D performance cliffs, default to formulaic derivation over visualization, and paradoxically suffer performance degradation from Chain-of-Thought prompting in open-source models. Through statistical and qualitative analysis of error types, SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark data and evaluation code are publicly available.

<title>BlockFFN: Towards End-Side Acceleration-Friendly Mixture-of-Experts with Chunk-Level Activation Sparsity</title>

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs), architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts (MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g., end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques (e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally, we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over 80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, AI Social Gym, Sociocultural Theory, Pedagogical Strategies, Knowledge Acquisition

Summary:
The study investigates the use of socially mediated learning paradigms to enhance the knowledge acquisition process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, the researchers created the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI learner agent engages in pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI teacher agents. The focus is on how different pedagogical strategies impact the AI learning process, particularly in ontology acquisition. The results show that dialogic approaches, including mixed-direction interactions, significantly improve the LLM's ability to acquire and apply new knowledge compared to traditional instructional methods and structured datasets. By integrating pedagogical and psychological insights into AI and robot training, the study highlights the potential for enhancing post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals, limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, EFL writing, editing behaviors, expository writing, secondary students

Summary: 
This research examines the impact of using AI-generated text in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts. The study focused on how secondary students in Hong Kong edit AI-generated text in their expository writing process and compositions. The findings revealed two main editing patterns among students: refining introductory units repeatedly and quickly shifting to extensive edits in body units. Despite significant editing efforts, the study showed only limited improvement in composition quality, indicating that AI supports but does not replace writing skills. The results suggest the importance of genre-specific instruction and process-focused writing before integrating AI. Educators should develop assessments valuing both the writing process and product to encourage critical engagement with AI text. <div>

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied. This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text. Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content, organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities. Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics, temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement with AI text.

Summary:
Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for solutions to the grounding problem, but this condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. Luc Steels presents a different suggestion, highlighting the need to rethink the problem's formulation and the role of goals in a system. By understanding computing, it becomes apparent that the only sensible grounding problem concerns explaining and reproducing the behavioral ability and function of meaning in artificial computational agents. This suggests a shift in focus towards understanding how meaning can be preserved and replicated within computational systems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in artificial computational agents

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, emotional tone, response bias, tone floor, AI alignment <br />
Summary: 
Large Language Models such as GPT-4 adjust their responses based on the emotional tone of prompts in addition to the actual question. The study systematically varied the emotional tone of 156 prompts across different topics and analyzed the impact on model responses. It was found that GPT-4 is more likely to respond neutrally or positively to negatively framed questions, indicating a "rebound" bias. This bias is even more pronounced in sensitive topics like justice and politics, where tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. The concept of a "tone floor" was introduced as a lower bound in response negativity, and tone-valence transition matrices were used to quantify the model's behavior. Visualizations based on embeddings confirmed semantic drift based on emotional tone. These findings highlight biases driven by emotional framing in prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced: tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity - and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust.

<div> framework, side effects, large language models, fine-tuning, model diffing
Summary:
The article introduces MNEME, a framework for identifying unintended side effects in large language models (LLMs) that occur during fine-tuning or unlearning processes. MNEME uses sparse model diffing to compare base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data, enabling the detection of behavioral shifts without access to fine-tuning data. The framework was tested on five LLMs across various scenarios, achieving up to 95 percent accuracy in predicting side effects. It successfully identified issues such as knowledge unlearning, emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning effects without the need for custom heuristics. The study also found that retraining on high-activation samples could partially reverse these effects. The results highlight the scalability and automation of MNEME in understanding and managing changes in LLM behavior brought about by fine-tuning processes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning, emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for understanding and managing LLM behavior.

<div> ensemble, amateur models, generation patterns, multi-amateur contrastive decoding, controllable generation <br />
Summary: 
Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD) is proposed as an enhancement to Contrastive Decoding (CD) for text generation. By utilizing an ensemble of amateur models, MACD is able to address a wider range of undesirable generation patterns such as repetition and hallucination. Through averaging and consensus mechanisms, MACD improves fluency, coherence, diversity, and adaptability in text generation across various domains. The framework also allows for controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with specific biases. Experimental results show that MACD outperforms conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of performance metrics, without the need for additional training. <div>
arXiv:2507.21086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) has emerged as an effective inference-time strategy for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news, encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency, coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional training or fine-tuning.

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper presents an approach to subjectivity detection in CheckThat! 2025 Task 1, utilizing a feature-augmented transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained language models with statistical and linguistic features. The system achieved competitive performance in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across various languages including English, Arabic, German, and Italian. The approach leverages pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features, such as part-of-speech tags and TF-IDF features for Arabic, and a cross-lingual DeBERTa V3 model with TF-IDF features and gating mechanism for other languages. The study highlights the effectiveness of combining TF-IDF features with the gating mechanism and cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity detection. An ablation analysis emphasized the importance of these components and revealed the model's sensitivity to the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and linguistic proximity of training languages. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the training languages.

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

Summary:
Arabic Rhetoric is a vital aspect of conveying messages effectively in Arabic linguistics, utilizing literary devices to enhance communication. However, measuring the use of Arabic rhetoric objectively has been a challenge. This study aimed to develop a tool to quantify the density of literary devices in Arabic texts, serving as a proxy for assessing Arabic rhetoric. By compiling a list of 84 common literary devices, creating a system to identify and calculate their density, and developing electronic tools, including a website and online calculator, the study offers a practical approach to analyze Arabic rhetoric. The tool can accurately determine the density of Arabic rhetoric in any text, aiding in the comparison of rhetoric usage across genres, authors, and historical periods. This innovative method provides a valuable resource for scholars and researchers in the field of Arabic linguistics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness. The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself. A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator. Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

Summary:
Curved Inference introduces a framework to track how a language model's trajectory changes in response to different semantic concerns. The study compares two large language models, Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b, across various semantic domains. Using metrics based on curvature and salience, the analysis reveals that both models adjust their internal activation trajectories in response to different prompts, with LLaMA showing more significant changes. The findings suggest a dual-layer structure in language model geometry, involving a latent conceptual space and prompt-specific contextual trajectories. The study highlights the importance of understanding how models navigate semantic meaning over different levels, providing insights into alignment, abstraction, and inference dynamics. Overall, Curved Inference offers a systematic approach to examining semantic abstraction and model alignment in language models.<br /><br />Summary: Curved Inference framework tracks language model trajectory changes in response to semantic concerns.

Across 20 matched prompts spanning emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics, with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants. Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate, reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics. These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces SemRAG, a framework that enhances the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model by efficiently integrating domain-specific knowledge through semantic chunking and knowledge graphs. SemRAG uses a semantic chunking algorithm to segment documents based on cosine similarity, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational overhead. By structuring retrieved information into knowledge graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and Wikipedia datasets show that SemRAG outperforms traditional RAG methods in terms of relevance and correctness of retrieved information.

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph, outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance, as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI applications in domain-specific fields.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern, data-driven insurance analytics.

Summary:<br /><br />
The study focuses on evaluating the safety of large language models (LLMs) in high-risk fields such as law, finance, and medicine. Domain-specific safety principles, based on established ethical codes, are defined for LLMs. Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically for assessing LLM safety in legal, financial, and medical domains, is introduced. Nineteen models were evaluated on Trident-Bench, revealing that generalist models meet basic safety expectations while domain-specialized models struggle with ethical nuances. The study underscores the need for domain-specific safety enhancements. Trident-Bench is a crucial resource for studying LLM safety in regulated fields and sets the stage for future research on mitigating safety risks in LLM deployment. The code and benchmark are available at the provided GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap, we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal, financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source our training and modeling code under an MIT license.

Summary: 
Diversity plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance of machine learning models, particularly large language models (LLMs). This study compares two diversity approaches in answering binary questions using LLMs: model diversity and question interpretation diversity. Model diversity involves multiple models answering the same question, while question interpretation diversity frames the same question in different ways for the same model to answer. Majority voting is used as the ensemble consensus heuristic to determine the final answer. Results across boolq, strategyqa, and pubmedqa datasets consistently demonstrate that question interpretation diversity outperforms model diversity in terms of ensemble accuracy. Analysis of GPT and LLaMa models indicates that model diversity often yields results between the best and worst ensemble members without significant improvement. This research provides valuable insights into the effective utilization of diversity strategies in enhancing the performance of LLMs in answering binary questions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs). However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa, and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges in explaining the decisions of transformer-based AI models, particularly in text classification tasks. Activation-based attribution methods, while effective, can be unreliable due to the presence of class-irrelevant features within activations. To address this issue, the authors propose a novel method called Contrast-CAT, which filters out such features to provide clearer and more accurate attribution maps. Experimental results demonstrate that Contrast-CAT outperforms existing methods, with significant improvements in interpretability metrics under the MoRF setting. The findings highlight the importance of enhancing interpretability in transformer models to foster trust and safe deployment in real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations, leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations, Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

Abstract: In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

arXiv:2507.21242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the door to further improvements in this area.

Summary: 
- The study explores the use of human-based clinical rationales in improving AI-driven clinical text classification for primary cancer site diagnoses.
- 99,125 human-based clinical rationales were analyzed alongside electronic pathology reports to train transformer-based models.
- Clinical rationales as additional training data showed improved model performance in high-resource scenarios but were inconsistent with limited resources.
- Using sufficiency as a metric for pre-selecting rationales yielded inconsistent results.
- Models trained on additional reports outperformed those trained on rationales, suggesting that labeling more reports is more beneficial for model accuracy.
- Training models on rationale-supplemented data slightly improved explainability but resulted in smaller performance improvements compared to additional report training. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649 electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority, training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

Summary: 
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about embedded biases, including gender, racial, and cultural biases derived from training data. This study examines how LLMs capture cross-cultural differences in moral perspectives by comparing variances in moral scores, conducting cluster alignment analyses, and probing models with comparative prompts. The results show that current LLMs often fail to accurately represent cross-cultural moral variation, compressing differences and showing low alignment with empirical survey patterns. This highlights the need for improved approaches to mitigate biases and enhance cultural representativeness in LLMs. The implications for the responsible development and global deployment of LLMs are discussed, emphasizing the importance of fairness and ethical alignment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives. Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical alignment.

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers worldwide.

<div> Framework, benchmarks, key-value extraction, text generation, evaluation strategy

Summary: 
The article introduces StructText, a framework for automatically generating benchmarks for key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It utilizes a two-stage pipeline to create synthetic natural-language text aligned with structured sources. The evaluation method combines LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence, along with objective extraction metrics for accuracy. Results show that LLMs excel in factual accuracy and avoid hallucination but struggle with narrative coherence. Models accurately represent numerical and temporal information but embed it within narratives that resist automated extraction. This work provides datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline extraction systems to support ongoing research in this field. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases. Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage ``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source, we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a) LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b) objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination, they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably, models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline extraction systems, to support continued research.

<div> history compressor, web automation, language models, web state, task-relevant information

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel approach to web automation using a history compressor module to distill task-relevant information from history states, enhancing the utilization of history in predicting next actions. It addresses the limitations of current web automation approaches that overlook the importance of history states due to the verbose nature of web page states. By compressing history states into fixed-length representations, the approach improves accuracy by 1.2-5.4% compared to baseline approaches without history inputs. The experiments conducted on Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in leveraging history states for more efficient web automation. <div>

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline approach without history inputs.

<div> Memory framework, LLM agents, tool management, autonomous, multi-turn interactions

Summary:
The study introduces MemTool, a framework that allows Large Language Model (LLM) agents to manage tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) server contexts in multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three modes: Autonomous Agent Mode, Workflow Mode, and Hybrid Mode, for tool management. Experiments on various LLMs show that Autonomous Agent Mode achieves high tool-removal efficiency for reasoning LLMs but lower efficiency for medium-sized models. Workflow and Hybrid modes effectively manage tool removal while Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. Trade-offs and recommendations for each MemTool mode are presented based on task accuracy, agency, and model capabilities. This research provides insights for efficient tool management in LLM agents for dynamic multi-turn interactions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated, independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1) Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode, combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100 consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average), while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%). Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model capabilities.

Summary: 
This study explores the use of open-access, locally deployable causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction, introducing LiTransMC as a fine-tuned model for this purpose. Evaluating eleven LLMs across multiple datasets, LiTransMC outperformed both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems, showcasing high predictive accuracy and interpretability. By combining structured behavioral prediction with natural language reasoning, this work paves the way for specialist, explainable transport models that can support simulations, policy testing, and behavioral insights. The findings suggest a transformation of general LLMs into specialized tools for transportation research and policy formulation, allowing for privacy, cost reduction, and increased access through local deployment. <div>
arXiv:2507.21432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task. We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory. LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy, achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of 0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems, including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading, while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning, this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and broadening access through local deployment.

Summary:
- LLMs are evaluated using HumorBench, a benchmark designed to assess their ability to reason about and explain humor in cartoon captions.
- The benchmark includes 300 unique cartoon-caption pairs with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics.
- Models must identify joke elements and form hypotheses to comprehend the humor, showcasing their reasoning abilities.
- Progress in STEM reasoning correlates with success in humor comprehension for LLMs.
- Training models solely on STEM reasoning data still results in strong performance on HumorBench, indicating transferability of reasoning skills.
- Increasing thinking token budgets at test time produces varying results across different models in humor reasoning.

<br /><br />Summary: 
HumorBench evaluates large language models' reasoning and humor comprehension skills using cartoon-caption pairs. Models must identify joke elements and form hypotheses to explain the humor, showcasing their reasoning abilities. Progress in STEM reasoning correlates with success in humor comprehension, demonstrating the transferability of reasoning skills. Training models solely on STEM reasoning data also leads to strong performance on HumorBench. However, increasing thinking token budgets at test time results in mixed outcomes across different models in humor reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2507.21476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately 300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, label-efficient learning, task-diversity, supervised finetuning, data selection 

Summary: 
This paper addresses the challenge of developing high-performing models for specialized applications with limited human annotation resources. By leveraging task-diversity instead of prompt-diversity, the authors propose a simple yet effective sampling strategy for supervised finetuning. The strategy involves selecting examples across tasks using an inverse confidence weighting approach based on the varying levels of confidence of pre-trained models. Experimental results show that this method can achieve better accuracy than training on the complete dataset, with up to a 4% increase in MMLU score. The algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80%. This approach provides comparable or superior results to more complex sampling procedures while being easier to implement and less computationally intensive.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score). Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

Summary: 
Large-scale test datasets for evaluating AI models in Vietnamese applications are lacking due to the country's high internet traffic and online toxicity. To address this issue, a new Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB, has been introduced by translating samples from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark. This benchmark consists of 41 datasets across six tasks tailored for Vietnamese text embeddings. Analysis shows that larger and more complex models utilizing Rotary Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in embedding tasks. The benchmark aims to facilitate the evaluation and deployment of embedding models in real-world projects. The datasets are available on HuggingFace. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41 datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings. In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in embedding tasks.

<div> Keywords: language models, persona vectors, personality shifts, training data, natural-language description

Summary:
Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant' persona, which can sometimes deviate from desired traits like honesty or helpfulness. This paper identifies persona vectors underlying traits like evil or sycophancy, which can be used to monitor and control personality shifts during training and deployment. Intended and unintended changes in the Assistant's personality after finetuning are linked to shifts along these persona vectors, highlighting the importance of managing them. A new preventative steering method can help avoid undesirable personality changes, while persona vectors can also flag problematic training data at both dataset and individual sample levels. The automated method for extracting persona vectors can be applied to any personality trait using only a natural-language description. This research offers insights into managing and optimizing the personality of large language models for better user interactions.

arXiv:2507.21509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant' persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of interest, given only a natural-language description.

<div> Transformer architectures, automatic speech recognition (ASR), speculative decoding, Token Map Drafting, n-gram token map

Summary: 
Token Map Drafting is proposed as a model-free speculative decoding technique for end-to-end ASR systems based on transformer architectures like Whisper. It eliminates the need for a separate draft model by leveraging a precomputed n-gram token map derived from domain-specific training data. This approach significantly accelerates ASR inference in structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy. Experimental results show decoding speed-ups of 1.27x on the CI-AVSR dataset and 1.37x on an internal dataset, with a 10% absolute improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU. Token Map Drafting proves effective for on-device ASR applications, offering efficient and accurate transcription capabilities on resource-constrained devices. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting}, a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model. Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU, highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

Summary:
TriangleMix introduces a novel static attention pattern that combines dense attention in shallow layers with a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper layers. This approach reduces attention overhead significantly in deep layers and decreases Time-to-First-Token by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths between 32K to 128K, without compromising model accuracy. The method does not require training and seamlessly integrates with dynamic sparsity techniques, further enhancing LLM inference efficiency. Experimental results show a 3.7x to 15.3x reduction in attention overhead in deep layers, and a 19% acceleration in MInference at 128K sequence length. TriangleMix offers a promising solution to improve computational efficiency in Large Language Models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup, e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to enhance LLM inference efficiency.

This study focuses on replicating and extending a previous study on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques in requirements engineering (RE). The research highlights the importance of replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies to enhance the external validity and reproducibility of findings. By reproducing the original results using publicly released source code, the study evaluates different deep learning models for requirement classification from user reviews. Results show diverse reproducibility levels across models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. BERT and ELMo exhibit good generalization capabilities on an external dataset, while GPT-4o performs comparably to traditional machine learning models. The assessment confirms the replication readiness of the baseline study, with enhancements made to increase readiness further. Overall, the study highlights the potential for machine-assisted workflows in RE tasks and underscores the value of replication in advancing NLP4RE research.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation, it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient, machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline), "Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models. Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and support the replication of our study.

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing (NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource, agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26 subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures. Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

Summary: 

The study addresses knowledge conflicts in retrieval-augmented generation systems, proposing a new framework called MAGIC that generates varied conflicts between similar contexts using knowledge graphs. Experiment results show that both open-source and proprietary models struggle with detecting conflicts, particularly in multi-hop reasoning scenarios. These models also struggle to identify the exact sources of contradictions. The study provides insights into how language models deal with conflicting information and suggests improvements for integrating diverse information. <div>
arXiv:2507.21544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions. Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

Summary: 
The study compares transformer-based neural networks to human data in analyzing the Spanish irregular morphomic pattern's cognitive plausibility. Using the same framework as the human study, the research assesses if transformer models can replicate human-like sensitivity to this linguistic phenomenon. The experiments focus on different frequency conditions and reveal that while the models excel in stem and suffix accuracy, they differ in response preferences from humans. Models tend to favor irregular responses and are influenced by the training data distribution. Interestingly, models trained on specific frequency distributions show varying levels of sensitivity to the phonological aspect of real Spanish L-shaped verbs. This study highlights how transformer models perform in simulating human behavior in understanding irregular morphomic patterns in language. <div>
arXiv:2507.21556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

<div> Keywords: sequence-level knowledge distillation, multilingual translation models, Multi-Hypothesis Distillation, low-resource languages, gender bias amplification 

Summary: 
- The paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation for multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models, focusing on the insights provided by the teacher model's output distribution beyond standard decoding methods. 
- It introduces Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a method that generates multiple translations for each source sentence to expose the student model to a wider range of target-side prefixes. 
- Utilizing $n$-best lists from beam search guides the student's learning process and addresses issues such as low variability and under-representation of infrequent tokens in alternative decoding methods. 
- For low-resource languages, sampling methods may slightly impact translation quality compared to beam search but enhance corpora variability and lexical richness, leading to improved student model performance. 
- The study also highlights how MHD can help mitigate gender bias amplification often associated with knowledge distillation techniques

Abstract: This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student, beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness. This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender bias amplification often associated with KD.

Summary:
Reinforcement learning has been instrumental in enhancing the reasoning abilities of language models. However, existing reward models face challenges in complex reasoning scenarios due to rule-based or reference-based rewards. To overcome these limitations, a framework is proposed to evaluate and enhance reward models in challenging reasoning scenarios. A reasoning-oriented benchmark called Libra Bench is introduced, comprising diverse mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models. A novel approach for improving generative reward models through learning-to-think methodologies is presented. The Libra-RM series of generative reward models with reasoning capabilities demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. Downstream experiments show a correlation between Libra Bench and applications, highlighting the potential of Libra-RM to enhance reasoning models using unlabeled data. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations: 1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and 2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark (Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application, and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with unlabeled data.

<div> Keywords: large reasoning models, safety alignment, unsafe completions, correction-based supervision, dataset

Summary: 
UnsafeChain is a new safety alignment dataset that addresses the challenge of hard prompts that consistently lead to harmful outputs in large reasoning models (LRMs). By identifying and correcting unsafe completions, the dataset aims to enhance safety while maintaining general reasoning ability. Three LRMs were fine-tuned on UnsafeChain and compared against previous datasets SafeChain and STAR-1 across various benchmarks. UnsafeChain consistently outperformed prior datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of correction-based supervision. Even a subset of 1K examples from UnsafeChain matched or exceeded baseline performance on these benchmarks. The dataset and code are publicly available for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs. To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and code at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/UnsafeChain

<div> vulnerable, adversarial attacks, pre-trained language models, robustness, embedding space <br />
Summary: 
The article discusses the vulnerability of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to adversarial attacks and proposes a novel method to enhance their robustness. The proposed approach involves removing instance-level principal components from the embedding space, transforming it to approximate Gaussian properties. This transformation helps reduce susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while maintaining semantic relationships. By aligning embedding distributions, the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries is minimized, improving robustness without the need for adversarial examples or expensive training-time augmentation. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach enhances adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable accuracy to baselines before attacks, striking a balance between robustness and generalization.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.21750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.

Summary: <br />
The paper focuses on the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors, specifically looking at safety classification models in multilingual scenarios. It highlights multilingual disparities in safety classifiers across 18 languages and points out potential issues with evaluation datasets. The study suggests that shortcomings in current safety classifiers are not solely due to the models themselves but also relate to the evaluation datasets. By analyzing 5 safety classification models, the paper aims to contribute to the development of more effective methods for identifying harmful content in LLM inputs across various languages. <div>
arXiv:2507.21782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue. Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves, there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

Summary: 
The article introduces a benchmark called HRIPBench, designed to evaluate the accuracy and safety risks of large language models (LLMs) in providing harm reduction information for individuals who use drugs (PWUD). The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic consists of 2,160 question-answer-evidence pairs covering tasks such as checking safety boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use risks. Results show that current state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to provide accurate harm reduction information and can pose severe safety risks to PWUD. It is crucial to cautiously limit the use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts to prevent negative health outcomes. The study highlights the importance of considering safety and accuracy when utilizing LLMs in providing information for individuals dealing with substance use issues.

arXiv:2507.21815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160 question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.

Summary: 
This article focuses on the task of capturing changes in plausibility triggered by modifying events, specifically adjectival modifiers. The study tackles the ADEPT challenge benchmark, using sentence transformers and transformer-based models. The results reveal that both models struggle with the task, with sentence transformers even underperforming compared to models like RoBERTa. The study emphasizes the importance of a more balanced evaluation method, showing that imbalances can distort model performance and evaluation metrics, undermining result reliability. This research sheds light on the difficulties in modeling changes in plausibility due to event modification and highlights the need for a more realistic evaluation approach in natural language processing tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.21828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic, balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

Summary: 
This article introduces HALC$, a pipeline designed to create optimal prompts for coding tasks using large language models (LLMs). The study conducted over two million requests using local LLMs to test prompting strategies and task performance. Results showed that prompts can reliably code for single variables and across two variables using the Mistral NeMo LLM. The prompts were designed to align the LLM with the codebook, rather than adapting the codebook for the LLM. The paper offers insights into the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, key influencing factors, and the identification of reliable prompts for coding tasks using LLMs. This research aims to streamline the process of automated coding in the social sciences by providing a systematic and reliable method for constructing prompts.

arXiv:2507.21831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable prompts for each coding task and model.

<title>AutoTIR: Autonomous Tools Integrated Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid, predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence. Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness, structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at https://github.com/weiyifan1023/AutoTIR.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost, fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

<title>Rote Learning Considered Useful: Generalizing over Memorized Data in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21914</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21914</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8 LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured, semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and social interaction.

<title>Post-Training Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization, similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates -- restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

<title>Culinary Crossroads: A RAG Framework for Enhancing Diversity in Cross-Cultural Recipe Adaptation</title>

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers: it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book LLMs.

<title>Predicting Microbial Ontology and Pathogen Risk from Environmental Metadata with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli, using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity, transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability over conventional RAG approaches.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.

Abstract: In human society, trust is an essential component of social attitude that helps build and maintain long-term, healthy relationships which creates a strong foundation for cooperation, enabling individuals to work together effectively and achieve shared goals. As many human interactions occur through electronic means such as using mobile apps, the potential arises for AI systems to assist users in understanding the social state of their relationships. In this paper we investigate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason about trust between two individuals in an environment which requires fostering trust relationships. We also assess whether LLMs are capable of inducing trust by role-playing one party in a trust based interaction and planning actions which can instil trust.

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly employ proactive moderation techniques, such as detecting and curbing toxic and uncivil comments, to prevent the spread of harmful content. Despite these efforts, such approaches are often criticized for creating a climate of censorship and failing to address the underlying causes of uncivil behavior. Our work makes both theoretical and practical contributions by proposing and evaluating two types of emotion monitoring dashboards to users' emotional awareness and mitigate hate speech. In a study involving 211 participants, we evaluate the effects of the two mechanisms on user commenting behavior and emotional experiences. The results reveal that these interventions effectively increase users' awareness of their emotional states and reduce hate speech. However, our findings also indicate potential unintended effects, including increased expression of negative emotions (Angry, Fear, and Sad) when discussing sensitive issues. These insights provide a basis for further research on integrating proactive emotion regulation tools into social media platforms to foster healthier digital interactions.

Abstract: The production of digital documents has been growing rapidly in academic, business, and health environments, presenting new challenges in the efficient extraction and analysis of unstructured information. This work investigates the use of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures combined with Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) to automate the analysis of documents in PDF format. The proposal integrates vector search techniques by embeddings, semantic data extraction and generation of contextualized natural language responses. To validate the approach, we conducted experiments with drug package inserts extracted from official public sources. The semantic queries applied were evaluated by metrics such as accuracy, completeness, response speed and consistency. The results indicate that the combination of RAG with LLMs offers significant gains in intelligent information retrieval and interpretation of unstructured technical texts.

Abstract: The rise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), has greatly facilitated the resolution of complex tasks. However, current systems are still facing challenges of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction with heterogeneous tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by Google have been introduced, and to the best of our knowledge, very few applications exist where both protocols are employed within a single MAS framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster, a novel modular multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP, enabling dynamic coordination and flexible communication. Through a unified conversational interface, the system supports natural language interaction without prior technical expertise and responds to multimodal queries for tasks including information retrieval, question answering, and image analysis. Evaluation through the BERTScore F1 and LLM-as-a-Judge metric G-Eval averaged 96.3\% and 87.1\%, revealing robust inter-agent coordination, query decomposition, dynamic routing, and domain-specific, relevant responses. Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities of domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many possibilities, questions about safety, privacy, and ethics have emerged, and all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature of LLMs makes the task of universally shielding users against their potential risks extremely challenging, and one-size-fits-all solutions unfeasible. In this work, we propose OneShield, our stand-alone, model-agnostic and customizable solution to safeguard LLMs. OneShield aims to provide facilities for defining risk factors, expressing and declaring contextual safety and compliance policies, and mitigating LLM risks, with a focus on each specific customer. We describe the implementation of the framework, the scalability considerations and provide usage statistics of OneShield since its first deployment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets. Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others, achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is available at https://github.com/linhaowei1/SLD.

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts. Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they "understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training, paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex, ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings, defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements -- that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives: text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging, offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE (Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be released soon.

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent "state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence of the neural net's data or task.

Abstract: As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online, tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET: Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations. Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within news article.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a "Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague, evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally, requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only 20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model, supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

<title>The pitfalls of next-token prediction</title>

Abstract: Can a mere next-token predictor faithfully model human intelligence? We crystallize this emerging concern and correct popular misconceptions surrounding it, and advocate a simple multi-token objective.
  As a starting point, we argue that the two often-conflated phases of next-token prediction -- autoregressive inference and teacher-forced training -- must be treated distinctly. The popular criticism that errors can compound during autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has learned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more deep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can simply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place. We describe a general mechanism of how teacher-forcing can fail, and design a minimal planning task where both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture empirically fail in that manner -- remarkably, despite the task being straightforward to learn.
  Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that this failure can be resolved using _teacherless_ training, a simple modification using dummy tokens that predicts multiple tokens in advance. We hope this finding can ground future debates and inspire explorations beyond the next-token prediction paradigm. We make our code available under https://github.com/gregorbachmann/Next-Token-Failures

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has gained interest in speech-text multimodal foundation models, achieving strong performance on instruction-tuned speech translation (ST). However, expanding language pairs is costly due to re-training on combined new and previous datasets. To address this, we aim to build a one-to-many ST system from existing one-to-one ST systems using task arithmetic without re-training. Direct application of task arithmetic in ST leads to language confusion; therefore, we introduce an augmented task arithmetic method incorporating a language control model to ensure correct target language generation. Our experiments on MuST-C and CoVoST-2 show BLEU score improvements of up to 4.66 and 4.92, with COMET gains of 8.87 and 11.83. In addition, we demonstrate our framework can extend to language pairs lacking paired ST training data or pre-trained ST models by synthesizing ST models based on existing machine translation (MT) and ST models via task analogies.

Abstract: Simulated patient systems play an important role in modern medical education and research, providing safe, integrative medical training environments and supporting clinical decision-making simulations. We developed AIPatient, an intelligent simulated patient system powered by large language model-based AI agents. The system incorporates the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, powered by six task-specific LLM-based AI agents for complex reasoning. For simulation reality, the system is also powered by the AIPatient KG (Knowledge Graph), built with de-identified real patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Primary outcomes showcase the system's intelligence, including the system's accuracy in Electronic Record (EHR)-based medical Question Answering (QA), readability, robustness, and stability. The system achieved a QA accuracy of 94.15% when all six AI agents present, surpassing benchmarks with partial or no agent integration. Its knowledgebase demonstrated high validity (F1 score=0.89). Readability scores showed median Flesch Reading Ease at 77.23 and median Flesch Kincaid Grade at 5.6, indicating accessibility to all medical professionals. Robustness and stability were confirmed with non-significant variance (ANOVA F-value=0.6126, p > 0.1; F-value=0.782, p > 0.1). A user study with medical students further demonstrated that AIPatient offers high fidelity, strong usability, and effective educational value, performing comparably or better than human-simulated patients in medical history-taking scenarios. The promising intelligence of the AIPatient system highlights its potential to support a wide range of applications, including medical education, model evaluation, and system integration.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the challenge of embedding realistic human personality traits into LLMs. Previous approaches have primarily focused on prompt-based methods that describe the behavior associated with the desired personality traits, suffering from realism and validity issues. To address these limitations, we introduce BIG5-CHAT, a large-scale dataset containing 100,000 dialogues designed to ground models in how humans express their personality in language. Leveraging this dataset, we explore Supervised Fine-Tuning and Direct Preference Optimization as training-based methods to align LLMs more naturally with human personality patterns. Our methods outperform prompting on personality assessments such as BFI and IPIP-NEO, with trait correlations more closely matching human data. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that models trained to exhibit higher conscientiousness, higher agreeableness, lower extraversion, and lower neuroticism display better performance on reasoning tasks, aligning with psychological findings on how these traits impact human cognitive performance. To our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive study to demonstrate how training-based methods can shape LLM personalities through learning from real human behaviors.

Abstract: Mining parallel document pairs for document-level machine translation (MT) remains challenging due to the limitations of existing Cross-Lingual Document Alignment (CLDA) techniques. Most approaches rely on metadata such as URLs, which is often unavailable in low-resource language settings, while others represent documents using pooled sentence embeddings, which fail to capture fine-grained alignment cues. Moreover, current sentence embedding models have limited context windows, hindering their ability to represent document-level information effectively. To address these challenges for Indic languages, we introduce PRALEKHA, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating document-level alignment techniques. It contains over 3 million aligned document pairs across 11 Indic languages and English, of which 1.5 million are English--Indic pairs. Furthermore, we propose Document Alignment Coefficient (DAC), a novel metric for fine-grained document alignment. Unlike pooling-based approaches, DAC aligns documents by matching smaller chunks and computes similarity as the ratio of aligned chunks to the average number of chunks in a pair. Intrinsic evaluation shows that DAC achieves substantial improvements over pooling-based baselines, particularly in noisy scenarios. Extrinsic evaluation further demonstrates that document MT models trained on DAC-aligned pairs consistently outperform those using baseline alignment methods. These results highlight DAC's effectiveness for parallel document mining. The PRALEKHA dataset and CLDA evaluation framework will be made publicly available.

Abstract: The effectiveness of instruction fine-tuning for Large Language Models is fundamentally constrained by the quality and efficiency of training datasets. This work introduces Low-Confidence Gold (LCG), a novel filtering framework that employs centroid-based clustering and confidence-guided selection for identifying valuable instruction pairs. Through a semi-supervised approach using a lightweight classifier trained on representative samples, LCG curates high-quality subsets while preserving data diversity. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that models fine-tuned on LCG-filtered subsets of 6K samples achieve superior performance compared to existing methods, with substantial improvements on MT-bench and consistent gains across comprehensive evaluation metrics. The framework's efficacy while maintaining model performance establishes a promising direction for efficient instruction tuning.

Abstract: Here we introduce Narrative Context Protocol (NCP), an open-source narrative standard designed to enable narrative interoperability, AI-driven authoring tools, real-time emergent narratives, and more. By encoding a story's structure in a "Storyform," which is a structured register of its narrative features, NCP enables narrative portability across systems as well as intent-based constraints for generative storytelling systems. We demonstrate the capabilities of NCP through a year-long experiment, during which an author used NCP and a custom authoring platform to create a playable, text-based experience based on her pre-existing novella. This experience is driven by generative AI, with unconstrained natural language input. NCP functions as a set of "guardrails" that allows the generative system to accommodate player agency while also ensuring that narrative context and coherence are maintained.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to scale up personalized tutoring through large language models (LLMs). Recent AI tutors are adapted for the tutoring task by training or prompting LLMs to follow effective pedagogical principles, though they are not trained to maximize student learning throughout the course of a dialogue. Therefore, they may engage with students in a suboptimal way. We address this limitation by introducing an approach to train LLMs to generate tutor utterances that maximize the likelihood of student correctness, while still encouraging the model to follow good pedagogical practice. Specifically, we generate a set of candidate tutor utterances and score them using (1) an LLM-based student model to predict the chance of correct student responses and (2) a pedagogical rubric evaluated by GPT-4o. We then use the resulting data to train an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1 8B, using direct preference optimization. We show that tutor utterances generated by our model lead to significantly higher chances of correct student responses while maintaining the pedagogical quality of GPT-4o. We also conduct qualitative analyses and a human evaluation to demonstrate that our model generates high quality tutor utterances.

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence systems, such as large language models, are increasingly powerful but also increasingly hard to understand. Recognizing this problem as analogous to the historical difficulties in understanding the human mind, we argue that methods developed in cognitive science can be useful for understanding large language models. We propose a framework for applying these methods based on the levels of analysis that David Marr proposed for studying information processing systems. By revisiting established cognitive science techniques relevant to each level and illustrating their potential to yield insights into the behavior and internal organization of large language models, we aim to provide a toolkit for making sense of these new kinds of minds.

Abstract: Deep networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding are often only trained to solve one specific task, such as pathology or age decoding. A more general task-agnostic approach is to train deep networks to match a (clinical) EEG recording to its corresponding textual medical report and vice versa. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework, EEG-CLIP, that aligns the EEG time series and the descriptions of the corresponding clinical text in a shared embedding space. We investigated its potential for versatile EEG decoding, evaluating performance in a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, we show that EEG-CLIP manages to non-trivially align text and EEG representations. Our work presents a promising approach to learn general EEG representations, which could enable easier analyses of diverse decoding questions through zero-shot decoding or training task-specific models from fewer training examples. The code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/tidiane-camaret/EEGClip

Abstract: The rapid growth of social media platforms has led to concerns about radicalization, filter bubbles, and content bias. Existing approaches to classifying ideology are limited in that they require extensive human effort, the labeling of large datasets, and are not able to adapt to evolving ideological contexts. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for classifying the political ideology of online content in the context of the two-party US political spectrum through in-context learning (ICL). Our extensive experiments involving demonstration selection in label-balanced fashion, conducted on three datasets comprising news articles and YouTube videos, reveal that our approach significantly outperforms zero-shot and traditional supervised methods. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of metadata (e.g., content source and descriptions) on ideological classification and discuss its implications. Finally, we show how providing the source for political and non-political content influences the LLM's classification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently utilized as sources of knowledge for question-answering. While it is known that LLMs may lack access to real-time data or newer data produced after the model's cutoff date, it is less clear how their knowledge spans across historical information. In this study, we assess the breadth of LLMs' knowledge using financial data of U.S. publicly traded companies by evaluating more than 197k questions and comparing model responses to factual data. We further explore the impact of company characteristics, such as size, retail investment, institutional attention, and readability of financial filings, on the accuracy of knowledge represented in LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs are less informed about past financial performance, but they display a stronger awareness of larger companies and more recent information. Interestingly, at the same time, our analysis also reveals that LLMs are more likely to hallucinate for larger companies, especially for data from more recent years. The code, prompts, and model outputs are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities to generate responses that simulate consistent personality traits. Despite the major attempts to analyze personality expression through output-based evaluations, little is known about how such traits are internally encoded within LLM parameters. In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing framework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in simulating personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11 open-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs predominantly simulate personality for responding in their middle and upper layers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer separation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained probing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we propose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by LLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly specifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the response personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting between certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the representational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis, demonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal degradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and acceptable inference latency. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/universe-sky/probing-then-editing-personality.

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with complex queries that lack strong signals to retrieve the most relevant context, forcing a trade-off between choosing a small context that misses key information and a large context that confuses the LLM. To address this, we propose Forward-Backward RAG (FB-RAG), a new training-free framework based on a simple yet powerful forward-looking strategy. FB-RAG employs a light-weight LLM to peek into potential future generations, using evidence from multiple sampled outputs to precisely identify the most relevant context for a final, more powerful generator. This improves performance without complex finetuning or Reinforcement Learning common in prior work. Across 9 datasets, FB-RAG consistently delivers strong results. Further, the performance gains can be achieved with reduced latency due to a shorter, more focused prompt for the powerful generator. On EN.QA dataset, FB-RAG matches the leading baseline with over 48% latency reduction or achieves an 8% performance improvement with a 10% latency reduction. Our analysis finds cases where even when the forward-looking LLM fails to generate correct answers, its attempts are sufficient to guide the final model to an accurate response, demonstrating how smaller LLMs can systematically improve the performance and efficiency of larger ones.

Abstract: A hallmark of human innovation is recombination -- the creation of novel ideas by integrating elements from existing concepts and mechanisms. In this work, we introduce CHIMERA, a large-scale Knowledge Base (KB) of over 28K recombination examples automatically mined from the scientific literature. CHIMERA enables large-scale empirical analysis of how scientists recombine concepts and draw inspiration from different areas, and enables training models that propose novel, cross-disciplinary research directions. To construct this KB, we define a new information extraction task: identifying recombination instances in scientific abstracts. We curate a high-quality, expert-annotated dataset and use it to fine-tune a large language model, which we apply to a broad corpus of AI papers. We showcase the utility of CHIMERA through two applications. First, we analyze patterns of recombination across AI subfields. Second, we train a scientific hypothesis generation model using the KB, showing that it can propose novel research directions that researchers rate as inspiring. We release our data and code at https://github.com/noy-sternlicht/CHIMERA-KB.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing, yet their high computational and memory demands pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Although recent low-rank decomposition methods offer a promising path for structural compression, they often suffer from accuracy degradation, expensive calibration procedures, and result in inefficient model architectures that hinder real-world inference speedups. In this paper, we propose FLAT-LLM, a fast and accurate, training-free structural compression method based on fine-grained low-rank transformations in the activation space. Specifically, we reduce the hidden dimension by transforming the weights using truncated eigenvectors computed via head-wise Principal Component Analysis, and employ a greedy budget redistribution strategy to adaptively allocate ranks across decoders. FLAT-LLM achieves efficient and effective weight compression without recovery fine-tuning, which could complete the calibration within a few minutes. Evaluated across 5 models and 11 datasets, FLAT-LLM outperforms structural pruning baselines in generalization and downstream performance, while delivering inference speedups over decomposition-based methods.

Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations, significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks, without introducing additional inference latency.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering" strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering (QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics, contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small training cost (1000 examples).

Abstract: Understanding the multilingual mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) provides insight into how they process different languages, yet this remains challenging. Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their polysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from cross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete and abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features are language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature activation probability, to identify language-specific features within the feed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in the middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features influence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be used for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along with more interpretability.

<title>Image Captioning via Compact Bidirectional Architecture</title>

Abstract: Most current image captioning models typically generate captions from left-to-right. This unidirectional property makes them can only leverage past context but not future context. Though refinement-based models can exploit both past and future context by generating a new caption in the second stage based on pre-retrieved or pre-generated captions in the first stage, the decoder of these models generally consists of two networks~(i.e. a retriever or captioner in the first stage and a captioner in the second stage), which can only be executed sequentially. In this paper, we introduce a Compact Bidirectional Transformer model for image captioning that can leverage bidirectional context implicitly and explicitly while the decoder can be executed parallelly. Specifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and right-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model to serve as a regularization for implicitly exploiting bidirectional context and optionally allowing explicit interaction of the bidirectional flows, while the final caption is chosen from either L2R or R2L flow in a sentence-level ensemble manner. We conduct extensive ablation studies on MSCOCO benchmark and find that the compact bidirectional architecture and the sentence-level ensemble play more important roles than the explicit interaction mechanism. By combining with word-level ensemble seamlessly, the effect of sentence-level ensemble is further enlarged. We further extend the conventional one-flow self-critical training to the two-flows version under this architecture and achieve new state-of-the-art results in comparison with non-vision-language-pretraining models. Finally, we verify the generality of this compact bidirectional architecture by extending it to LSTM backbone. Source code is available at https://github.com/YuanEZhou/cbtic.

<title>Latent Adversarial Training Improves Robustness to Persistent Harmful Behaviors in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often be made to behave in undesirable ways that they are explicitly fine-tuned not to. For example, the LLM red-teaming literature has produced a wide variety of 'jailbreaking' techniques to elicit harmful text from models that were fine-tuned to be harmless. Recent work on red-teaming, model editing, and interpretability suggests that this challenge stems from how (adversarial) fine-tuning largely serves to suppress rather than remove undesirable capabilities from LLMs. Prior work has introduced latent adversarial training (LAT) as a way to improve robustness to broad classes of failures. These prior works have considered untargeted latent space attacks where the adversary perturbs latent activations to maximize loss on examples of desirable behavior. Untargeted LAT can provide a generic type of robustness but does not leverage information about specific failure modes. Here, we experiment with targeted LAT where the adversary seeks to minimize loss on a specific competing task. We find that it can augment a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods. First, we use targeted LAT to improve robustness to jailbreaks, outperforming a strong R2D2 baseline with orders of magnitude less compute. Second, we use it to more effectively remove backdoors with no knowledge of the trigger. Finally, we use it to more effectively unlearn knowledge for specific undesirable tasks in a way that is also more robust to re-learning. Overall, our results suggest that targeted LAT can be an effective tool for defending against harmful behaviors from LLMs.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning and planning typically requires vast amounts of data and training to develop effective policies. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities, but struggle with tasks that require detailed planning and decision-making in complex action spaces. We introduce STRATEGIST, a novel approach that integrates the strengths of both methods. Our approach leverages LLMs to search and update high-level strategies (as text), which are then refined and executed by low-level Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). STRATEGIST is a generalizable framework to optimize the strategy through population-based self-play simulations without the need for any training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STRATEGIST in learning optimal strategies for competitive, multi-turn games with partial information, including Game of Pure Strategy (GOPS) and multi-agent, hidden-identity discussion games like The Resistance: Avalon. Our results show that agents equipped with STRATEGIST outperform those trained with traditional RL methods, other LLM-based skill acquisition techniques, pre-existing LLM agents across both game environments and achieves comparable performance against human players.

Abstract: Sign language is a visual language that encompasses all linguistic features of natural languages and serves as the primary communication method for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. Although many studies have successfully adapted pretrained language models (LMs) for sign language translation (sign-to-text), the reverse task-sign language generation (text-to-sign)-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a multilingual sign language model, Signs as Tokens (SOKE), which can generate 3D sign avatars autoregressively from text inputs using a pretrained LM. To align sign language with the LM, we leverage a decoupled tokenizer that discretizes continuous signs into token sequences representing various body parts. During decoding, unlike existing approaches that flatten all part-wise tokens into a single sequence and predict one token at a time, we propose a multi-head decoding method capable of predicting multiple tokens simultaneously. This approach improves inference efficiency while maintaining effective information fusion across different body parts. To further ease the generation process, we propose a retrieval-enhanced SLG approach, which incorporates external sign dictionaries to provide accurate word-level signs as auxiliary conditions, significantly improving the precision of generated signs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SOKE.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of multi-modal LLMs that exhibit strong comprehension of visual data such as images and videos. However, these models usually rely on extensive visual tokens from visual encoders, leading to high computational demands, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments and for long-context tasks. In this work, we propose a training-free adaptive inference method for multi-modal LLMs that can accommodate a broad range of efficiency requirements with a minimum performance drop. Our method consists of a) iterative token merging based on embedding similarity before LLMs, and b) progressive token pruning within LLM layers based on multi-modal importance. With a minimalist design, our method can be applied to both video and image LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse video and image benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces computation load (e.g., a $\textbf{7-fold}$ reduction in FLOPs) while preserving the performance of video and image LLMs. Further, at a similar computational cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in long video understanding (e.g., $\textbf{+4.6}$ on MLVU). Additionally, our in-depth analysis provides insights into token redundancy and LLM layer behaviors, offering guidance for future research in designing efficient multi-modal LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/AIM.

Abstract: As Large Langue Models have been shown to memorize real-world facts, the need to update this knowledge in a controlled and efficient manner arises. Designed with these constraints in mind, Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches propose to alter specific facts in pretrained models. However, they have been shown to suffer from several limitations, including their lack of contextual robustness and their failure to generalize to logical implications related to the fact. To overcome these issues, we propose SAKE, a steering activation method that models a fact to be edited as a distribution rather than a single prompt. Leveraging Optimal Transport, SAKE alters the LLM behavior over a whole fact-related distribution, defined as paraphrases and logical implications. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method: SAKE is thus able to perform more robust edits than its existing counterparts.

arXiv:2503.24358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.

Abstract: We introduce LlamaPIE, the first real-time proactive assistant designed to enhance human conversations through discreet, concise guidance delivered via hearable devices. Unlike traditional language models that require explicit user invocation, this assistant operates in the background, anticipating user needs without interrupting conversations. We address several challenges, including determining when to respond, crafting concise responses that enhance conversations, leveraging knowledge of the user for context-aware assistance, and real-time, on-device processing. To achieve this, we construct a semi-synthetic dialogue dataset and propose a two-model pipeline: a small model that decides when to respond and a larger model that generates the response. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing helpful, unobtrusive assistance. User studies with our assistant, implemented on Apple Silicon M2 hardware, show a strong preference for the proactive assistant over both a baseline with no assistance and a reactive model, highlighting the potential of LlamaPie to enhance live conversations.

Abstract: Enhancing Large Language Model (LLM)'s performance with best-of-N sampling is effective and has attracted significant attention. However, it is computationally prohibitive due to massive, data-hungry text-based reward models. By changing the data source from text to hidden states, we introduce SWIFT (Simple Weighted Intrinsic Feedback Technique), a novel, lightweight technique that leverages the rich information embedded in LLM hidden states to address these issues, which operates on token-level and consists of only linear layers. Extensive experiments show that SWIFT outperforms baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only a few samples for training, demonstrating significant efficiency improvement. SWIFT's robust scalability, applicability to some closed-source models via logits, and ability to be combined with traditional reward models to yield further performance gains underscore its practical value.

arXiv:2505.14479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.

<title>Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2506.01413v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose RAIF, a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Evaluation on OOD constraints also confirms the generalizability of our RAIF. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/RAIF.

Abstract: We present FlagEvalMM, an open-source evaluation framework designed to comprehensively assess multimodal models across a diverse range of vision-language understanding and generation tasks, such as visual question answering, text-to-image/video generation, and image-text retrieval. We decouple model inference from evaluation through an independent evaluation service, thus enabling flexible resource allocation and seamless integration of new tasks and models. Moreover, FlagEvalMM utilizes advanced inference acceleration tools (e.g., vLLM, SGLang) and asynchronous data loading to significantly enhance evaluation efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FlagEvalMM offers accurate and efficient insights into model strengths and limitations, making it a valuable tool for advancing multimodal research.

Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores. However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs.

Abstract: We present Audio Flamingo 3 (AF3), a fully open state-of-the-art (SOTA) large audio-language model that advances reasoning and understanding across speech, sound, and music. AF3 introduces: (i) AF-Whisper, a unified audio encoder trained using a novel strategy for joint representation learning across all 3 modalities of speech, sound, and music; (ii) flexible, on-demand thinking, allowing the model to do chain-of-thought-type reasoning before answering; (iii) multi-turn, multi-audio chat; (iv) long audio understanding and reasoning (including speech) up to 10 minutes; and (v) voice-to-voice interaction. To enable these capabilities, we propose several large-scale training datasets curated using novel strategies, including AudioSkills-XL, LongAudio-XL, AF-Think, and AF-Chat, and train AF3 with a novel five-stage curriculum-based training strategy. Trained on only open-source audio data, AF3 achieves new SOTA results on over 20+ (long) audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, surpassing both open-weight and closed-source models trained on much larger datasets.

Large language models have made significant advancements in various languages, but Tibetan, a low-resource language, lacks representation due to limited training data. To address this issue, a comprehensive Tibetan pre-training corpus has been curated from multiple sources and processed using a specialized pipeline. By leveraging this data, a multilingual model has been further trained to enhance its capabilities in generating Tibetan text. New high-quality Tibetan benchmarks have been created to evaluate the model's performance, in addition to existing benchmarks. Experimental results show that the model consistently outperforms open-source and Tibetan-specific models in various tasks. The curated corpus, dedicated data cleaning, and tailored pre/post-training of the model have collectively contributed to significant improvements in the model's performance on Tibetan language tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual base model to enhance its generative capabilities in Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model, we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.

Abstract: The rising prevalence of mental health disorders necessitates the development of robust, automated tools for early detection and monitoring. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transformer-based architectures, have demonstrated significant potential in text analysis. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA) against Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based approaches using different text embedding techniques for mental health disorder classification on Reddit. We construct a large annotated dataset, validating its reliability through statistical judgmental analysis and topic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of transformer models over traditional deep-learning approaches. RoBERTa achieved the highest classification performance, with a 99.54% F1 score on the hold-out test set and a 96.05% F1 score on the external test set. Notably, LSTM models augmented with BERT embeddings proved highly competitive, achieving F1 scores exceeding 94% on the external dataset while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. These findings highlight the effectiveness of transformer-based models for real-time, scalable mental health monitoring. We discuss the implications for clinical applications and digital mental health interventions, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art NLP methodologies in mental disorder detection.

Summary: <br />
The study focuses on enhancing the organization and comparison of academic literature through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). By addressing issues such as ambiguity in evaluations and lack of editing methods, the research presents an approach that incorporates table intents to improve schema generation performance. Benchmarking various schema generation methods reveals the competitiveness of smaller, open-weight models with state-of-the-art LLMs, while LLM-based schema editing techniques are introduced to refine the generated schemas further. <div>

Abstract: The increasing volume of academic literature makes it essential for researchers to organize, compare, and contrast collections of documents. Large language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating schemas defining shared aspects along which to compare papers. However, progress on schema generation has been slow due to: (i) ambiguity in reference-based evaluations, and (ii) lack of editing/refinement methods. Our work is the first to address both issues. First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table corpora with synthesized intents and apply it to create a dataset for studying schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference schemas. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema editing techniques. We start by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods, including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller, open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art prompted LLMs. Then we demonstrate that our editing techniques can further improve schemas generated by these methods.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new evaluation framework for geospatial hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages structured geospatial knowledge graphs to assess inaccuracies in geospatial information generated by LLMs. The study evaluates 20 advanced LLMs and identifies geospatial hallucinations in their knowledge. A dynamic factuality aligning method based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) is proposed to mitigate these hallucinations, resulting in a significant performance improvement of over 29.6% on the benchmark. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the framework and learning algorithm in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks. This comprehensive approach addresses the issue of geospatial hallucinations and improves the reliability of LLMs in handling geospatial tasks. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However, LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across 20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge. Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.

Summary:
This article discusses the challenges posed by the quadratic time and memory complexity of self-attention in Transformer-based architectures and explores two categories of efficient attention mechanisms: linear attention and sparse attention. Linear attention methods achieve linear complexity through various techniques, such as kernel approximations and fast weight dynamics, while sparse attention techniques limit attention computation to selected subsets of tokens. The survey provides a comprehensive overview of these developments, considering both algorithmic innovations and hardware-level considerations. It also examines the integration of efficient attention into large-scale pre-trained language models, including architectures built entirely on efficient attention and hybrid designs combining local and global components. By bridging theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, the article serves as a foundational reference for improving the design of scalable and efficient language models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns, block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and efficient language models.

Summary:<br />
Recent advancements in Large Language Models have improved their ability to generate code, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, particularly multi-turn malicious prompts, has not been extensively studied. This work introduces code decomposition attacks, where a malicious coding task is split into smaller subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade detection. A benchmark called MOCHA is introduced to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Results show persistent vulnerabilities, especially in multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA helps improve rejection rates while maintaining coding ability. This fine-tuning also enhances robustness on external adversarial datasets, with rejection rates increasing by up to 32.4% without additional supervision.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks, where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open- and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any additional supervision.

Abstract: This paper presents HITSZ's submission for the IWSLT 2025 Indic track, focusing on speech-to-text translation (ST) for English-to-Indic and Indic-to-English language pairs. To enhance translation quality in this low-resource scenario, we propose an end-to-end system integrating the pre-trained Whisper automated speech recognition (ASR) model with Krutrim, an Indic-specialized large language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate that our end-to-end system achieved average BLEU scores of $28.88$ for English-to-Indic directions and $27.86$ for Indic-to-English directions. Furthermore, we investigated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. While this method showed potential for significant translation quality improvements on successfully parsed outputs (e.g. a $13.84$ BLEU increase for Tamil-to-English), we observed challenges in ensuring the model consistently adheres to the required CoT output format.

Summary: 
- Recent advances in large language models have led to the development of multimodal LLMs integrating text, speech, and vision.
- Challenges remain in evaluating the multilingual and multimodal capabilities of these models over long and short contexts.
- Existing benchmarks are limited in scope, often focusing on one modality or lacking human annotations.
- To address these limitations, the MCIF benchmark is introduced, designed for evaluating instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings across languages and modalities.
- MCIF spans speech, vision, and text modalities in English, German, Italian, and Chinese, providing a comprehensive assessment of MLLMs' abilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human annotations--hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities--speech, vision, and text--and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open research and progress in MLLMs development.

Abstract: The intersection of AI and legal systems presents a growing need for tools that support legal education, particularly in under-resourced languages such as Romanian. In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning about Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks. To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, alongside annotated legal references and human explanations. We implement and assess retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and reasoning-optimized models across tasks including Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance. At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving exams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the potential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.

Summary:
Multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs) were benchmarked across Arabic, English, and Indic languages, with a focus on model compression techniques such as pruning and quantization. Various state-of-the-art LLMS like BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2, XGLM, and AraGPT2 were evaluated, revealing performance variations influenced by linguistic diversity and resource availability. Multilingual models exhibited superior performance compared to language-specific models, showcasing significant cross-lingual transfer benefits. Quantization proved effective in maintaining model accuracy and efficiency, particularly with 4-bit and 8-bit precision, while aggressive pruning negatively impacted model performance, especially in larger models. The study identified crucial strategies for developing scalable and equitable multilingual NLP solutions and emphasized the importance of addressing hallucination and generalization errors in low-resource environments.

Abstract: Although LLMs have attained significant success in high-resource languages, their capacity in low-resource linguistic environments like Kannada and Arabic is not yet fully understood. This work benchmarking the performance of multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs) across Arabic, English, and Indic languages, with particular emphasis on the effects of model compression strategies such as pruning and quantization. Findings shows significant performance differences driven by linguistic diversity and resource availability on SOTA LLMS as BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2, XGLM, and AraGPT2. We find that multilingual versions of the model outperform their language-specific counterparts across the board, indicating substantial cross-lingual transfer benefits. Quantization (4-bit and 8-bit) is effective in maintaining model accuracy while promoting efficiency, but aggressive pruning significantly compromises performance, especially in bigger models. Our findings pinpoint key strategies to construct scalable and fair multilingual NLP solutions and underscore the need for interventions to address hallucination and generalization errors in the low-resource setting.

Abstract: In Table-to-Text (T2T) generation, existing approaches predominantly focus on providing objective descriptions of tabular data. However, generating text that incorporates subjectivity, where subjectivity refers to interpretations beyond raw numerical data, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce a novel pipeline that leverages intermediate representations to generate both objective and subjective text from tables. Our three-stage pipeline consists of: 1) extraction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, 2) aggregation of text into coherent narratives, and 3) infusion of subjectivity to enrich the generated text. By incorporating RDFs, our approach enhances factual accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Unlike large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama-2, our pipeline employs smaller, fine-tuned T5 models while achieving comparable performance to GPT-3.5 and outperforming Mistral-7B and Llama-2 in several metrics. We evaluate our approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing factual accuracy with subjective interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a structured pipeline for T2T generation that integrates intermediate representations to enhance both factual correctness and subjectivity.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Distillation, Basic Reading Education, Named Entity Recognition, Language Inference<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces the concept of basic reading distillation (BRD) as a new technique to enhance the capabilities of small models to imitate large language models' (LLMs) basic reading behaviors. BRD focuses on educating small models on generic texts, unrelated to specific downstream tasks, to improve their performance. By training small models to imitate LLMs' abilities such as named entity recognition, question answering, and more, the study demonstrates that these small models can surpass or match the performance of significantly larger LLMs. The analysis shows that BRD impacts the probability distribution of the small model effectively and is distinct from traditional methods like knowledge distillation or task distillation. This research highlights the potential of BRD in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of language models in various natural language processing tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in various natural language processing areas, but they demand high computation resources which limits their deployment in real-world. Distillation is one technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for small models on generic texts that are \emph{unrelated} to downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that BRD effectively influences the probability distribution of the small model, and has orthogonality to either knowledge distillation or task distillation.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence and a primary benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework. Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL) method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length up to 32K tokens. JT-Math-8B achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models of similar size, surpassing prominent models like OpenAI's O1-mini and GPT-4o , and demonstrating superior performance on competition-level mathematics.

Abstract: In addition to its more widely studied political activities, the American Evangelical movement has a well-developed but less externally visible cultural and literary side. Christian Fiction, however, has been little studied, and what scholarly attention there is has focused on the explosively popular Left Behind series. In this work, we use computational tools to provide both a broad topical overview of Christian Fiction as a genre and a more directed exploration of how its authors depict divine acts. Working with human annotators we first developed definitions and a codebook for "acts of God." We then adapted those instructions designed for human annotators for use by a recent, lightweight LM with the assistance of a much larger model. The laptop-scale LM is capable of matching human annotations, even when the task is subtle and challenging. Using these annotations, we show that significant and meaningful differences exist between the Left Behind books and Christian Fiction more broadly and between books by male and female authors.

<div> Keywords: large language models, reinforcement learning, ultra-long output, reasoning abilities, dynamic masking

Summary: 
Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) proposes a novel approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by addressing challenges in handling ultra-long outputs. By dividing long output decoding into shorter segments, UloRL significantly improves training efficiency by mitigating delays associated with long-tail sequence distributions. Dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive Tokens (MPTs) is introduced to prevent entropy collapse during training. Experimental results show that the method achieves a 2.06x increase in training speed and boosts model performance on various tasks, surpassing even larger models. The findings indicate the potential of UloRL to advance LLM reasoning capabilities with ultra-long sequence generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with 128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to 85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the community.

<div> Keywords: Long-context construction, Large Language Models, Flora, Instruction tuning, Context diversity

Summary:
Flora is a new approach that aims to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling long contexts without the need for human intervention or specialized LLM modifications. It achieves this by assembling short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs with long-context meta-instructions to generate responses. Flora can generate contexts of varying lengths with rich diversity while maintaining strong performance in short-context tasks. Experimental results on Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of Flora in enhancing the long-context performance of LLMs. This approach addresses the challenges associated with long-context handling in LLMs, such as computational demands and forgetting of short-context abilities, providing a more efficient and scalable solution. The code for data construction is also available for reference on GitHub. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and substantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have attempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods often require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in length and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present long-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an effortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can markedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate responses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to produce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only slightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three long-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context tasks.

<div> key quantization, value offloading, dynamic KV eviction, heterogeneous attention computation, memory constraints <br />
Summary:
HCAttention is a new framework proposed for processing long-context inputs with large language models. It addresses the challenge of high memory requirements for the Key-Value cache during inference by integrating key quantization, value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction. This allows for efficient inference under extreme memory constraints without the need for model fine-tuning. Experimental results on the LongBench benchmark show that HCAttention maintains accuracy while reducing the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of its original size. It achieves competitive performance with only 12.5% of the cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. HCAttention extends the Llama-3-8B model to process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory, making it the first of its kind. <div>

Abstract: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%. Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization, value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

<div> Keywords: in-car conversational AI, DiscoDrive, synthetic corpus, disfluencies, training resource

Summary:
DiscoDrive is a synthetic corpus consisting of 3500 multi-turn dialogs across seven automotive domains, capturing spontaneous disfluencies like hesitations and repetitions. It addresses the lack of real-world driver-AI dialogs in existing datasets. The corpus enables models like DialoGPT-Medium and T5-Base to outperform KVRET-trained models on relevant test sets, showing improvements in various evaluation metrics. When used as a data augmentation resource in low-resource scenarios, DiscoDrive enhances model performance even further. Human evaluations indicate that dialogs from DiscoDrive are rated higher in naturalness and coherence compared to human-collected dialogs from KVRET. Additionally, the dialogs are perceived as more context-appropriate than existing post-hoc methods like LARD, without sacrificing clarity. This versatile corpus fills a crucial gap in existing resources and supports the training and augmentation of conversational AI systems for handling real-world in-car interactions effectively. 

<br /><br />Summary: DiscoDrive is a synthetic corpus of in-car conversational AI dialogs that integrates disfluencies, enhancing model performance and human evaluations. <div>
arXiv:2507.19867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-car conversational AI is becoming increasingly critical as autonomous vehicles and smart assistants gain widespread adoption. Yet, existing datasets fail to capture the spontaneous disfluencies such as hesitations, false starts, repetitions, and self-corrections that characterize real driver-AI dialogs. To address this, we introduce DiscoDrive, a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn dialogs across seven automotive domains, generated using a two-stage, prompt-driven pipeline that dynamically integrates disfluencies during synthesis. We show that DiscoDrive is effective both as a training resource, enabling DialoGPT-Medium and T5-Base to match or exceed KVRET-trained models on the MultiWOZ 2.2 and Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) relevant test sets (BLEU-4 improvements of 0.26 to 0.61; METEOR +2.10; ROUGE-L +3.48; BERTScore F1 improvements of 1.35 to 3.48), and as a data augmentation resource in low-resource scenarios, delivering additional gains of up to BLEU-4 +0.38, METEOR +1.95, ROUGE-L +2.87, and BERTScore F1 +4.00 when combined with 10 percent of KVRET. Human evaluations further confirm that dialogs sampled from DiscoDrive are rated higher than KVRET's human-collected dialogs in naturalness (3.8 vs 3.6) and coherence (4.1 vs 4.0), and are perceived as more context-appropriate than leading post-hoc methods (such as LARD), without compromising clarity. DiscoDrive fills a critical gap in existing resources and serves as a versatile corpus for both training and augmenting conversational AI, enabling robust handling of real-world, disfluent in-car interactions.

arXiv:2507.19885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflows, and personalizing treatment plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural language processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these models has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential biases in their performance across different languages.
  This study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo, LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and Command R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet, and Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese from the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Cl\'inicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\~ao Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest health complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked against human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of the generated explanations.
  The results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Claude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates, performance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image interpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities, emphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for non-English medical AI applications.
  Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various linguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in healthcare. Future research should explore improved training methodologies, improved multimodal reasoning, and real-world clinical integration of AI-driven medical assistance.

Abstract: Early detection of depression from online social media posts holds promise for providing timely mental health interventions. In this work, we present a high-quality, expert-annotated dataset of 1,017 social media posts labeled with depressive spans and mapped to 12 depression symptom categories. Unlike prior datasets that primarily offer coarse post-level labels \cite{cohan-etal-2018-smhd}, our dataset enables fine-grained evaluation of both model predictions and generated explanations.
  We develop an evaluation framework that leverages this clinically grounded dataset to assess the faithfulness and quality of natural language explanations generated by large language models (LLMs). Through carefully designed prompting strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with domain-adapted examples, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs including GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
  Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals significant differences in how these models perform on clinical explanation tasks, with zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Our findings underscore the value of human expertise in guiding LLM behavior and offer a step toward safer, more transparent AI systems for psychological well-being.

Summary:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant computational resources for generation.
- The Key-Value (KV) cache accelerates this process by storing attention intermediates but faces memory footprint challenges.
- Various techniques like token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection help compress the KV cache.
- Token eviction is a common strategy but can lead to accuracy degradation, especially under high compression ratios.
- CaliDrop enhances token eviction through calibration, leveraging the observation that nearby positions in queries exhibit high similarity.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques, including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

Summary: 
The article introduces KLAAD, a debiasing framework for large language models that aims to mitigate societal biases in their outputs. KLAAD utilizes attention alignment between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs without directly modifying model weights. By combining Cross-Entropy, KL divergence, and Triplet losses in a composite training objective, KLAAD guides the model to attend consistently across biased and unbiased contexts while maintaining fluency and coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that KLAAD effectively reduces bias in generative language models, as shown on the BBQ and BOLD benchmarks. Despite the bias mitigation, KLAAD has minimal impact on the quality of language modeling. This research suggests that attention-level alignment can offer a principled approach to addressing bias in language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit societal biases in their outputs, prompting ethical concerns regarding fairness and harm. In this work, we propose KLAAD (KL-Attention Alignment Debiasing), an attention-based debiasing framework that implicitly aligns attention distributions between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs without directly modifying model weights. KLAAD introduces a composite training objective combining Cross-Entropy, KL divergence, and Triplet losses, guiding the model to consistently attend across biased and unbiased contexts while preserving fluency and coherence. Experimental evaluation of KLAAD demonstrates improved bias mitigation on both the BBQ and BOLD benchmarks, with minimal impact on language modeling quality. The results indicate that attention-level alignment offers a principled solution for mitigating bias in generative language models.

Abstract: Automated data visualization plays a crucial role in simplifying data interpretation, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating visualizations from natural language, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks limits the rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. We introduce Text2Vis, a benchmark designed to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and diverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier detection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a data table, natural language query, short answer, visualization code, and annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns, and dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source models, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges, and offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose the first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the textual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26% to 42% over the direct approach and improving chart quality. We also introduce an automated LLM-based evaluation framework that enables scalable assessment across thousands of samples without human annotation, measuring answer correctness, code execution success, visualization readability, and chart accuracy.

Abstract: This study investigates the estimation of reliability for large language models (LLMs) in scoring writing tasks from the AP Chinese Language and Culture Exam. Using generalizability theory, the research evaluates and compares score consistency between human and AI raters across two types of AP Chinese free-response writing tasks: story narration and email response. These essays were independently scored by two trained human raters and seven AI raters. Each essay received four scores: one holistic score and three analytic scores corresponding to the domains of task completion, delivery, and language use. Results indicate that although human raters produced more reliable scores overall, LLMs demonstrated reasonable consistency under certain conditions, particularly for story narration tasks. Composite scoring that incorporates both human and AI raters improved reliability, which supports that hybrid scoring models may offer benefits for large-scale writing assessments.

The domain-specific nature of legal systems across different countries and languages presents a hurdle in developing legal text processing applications for various natural languages. The scarcity of resources and annotated data poses a significant challenge, particularly in low-resource languages like Vietnamese. To address this gap, the VLQA dataset is introduced as a high-quality resource tailored for the Vietnamese legal domain. A statistical analysis of the dataset is provided, showcasing its effectiveness in legal information retrieval and question-answering tasks when used with state-of-the-art models. Efforts to bridge the gap in legal NLP for diverse languages are essential for advancing the field of AI and NLP in the legal domain. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant achievements in various domains, including legal text processing. Leveraging LLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling choice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they truly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of fully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific and exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The need for building legal text processing applications for different natural languages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge for legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity of resources and annotated data. The need for labeled legal corpora for supervised training, validation, and supervised fine-tuning is critical. In this paper, we introduce the VLQA dataset, a comprehensive and high-quality resource tailored for the Vietnamese legal domain. We also conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset and evaluate its effectiveness through experiments with state-of-the-art models on legal information retrieval and question-answering tasks.

Summary:
- Researchers propose a meta learning framework for detecting anomalies in human language across different domains with limited labeled data.

Abstract: We propose a meta learning framework for detecting anomalies in human language across diverse domains with limited labeled data. Anomalies in language ranging from spam and fake news to hate speech pose a major challenge due to their sparsity and variability. We treat anomaly detection as a few shot binary classification problem and leverage meta-learning to train models that generalize across tasks. Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19 fake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks with minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with prototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly detection tasks. Empirical results show that our method outperforms strong baselines in F1 and AUC scores. We also release the code and benchmarks to facilitate further research in few-shot text anomaly detection.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces FAEDKV, a compression framework for Key-Value (KV) cache in Large Language Models (LLMs) that aims to address issues of biased representation and excessive memory usage. FAEDKV utilizes an Infinite-Window Fourier Transform to transform the KV cache into the frequency domain, ensuring equalized contribution of all tokens for unbiased information retention. A frequency ablation study identifies critical spectral components for effective compression. Experimental results on the LongBench benchmark demonstrate up to 22% improvement over existing methods. FAEDKV also outperforms compression-based approaches in position-agnostic retrieval accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task. This innovative approach offers a promising solution to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs in long-context tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel, training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based approaches.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the task of generating complex statistical infographics from text-heavy documents using AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses the lack of prior work in this area by proposing a new benchmark dataset called Infodat, which links documents to infographic metadata. The Infogen framework, a two-stage process involving fine-tuned LLMs, is presented for text-to-infographic code generation. Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-statistical infographic generation compared to existing LLMs. The generated infographics consist of multiple sub-charts like line, bar, and pie graphs, with contextually accurate and visually aligned insights. This work highlights the potential of AI in simplifying complex data into visually engaging and easy-to-understand formats through the creation of advanced statistical infographics. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical infographics are powerful tools that simplify complex data into visually engaging and easy-to-understand formats. Despite advancements in AI, particularly with LLMs, existing efforts have been limited to generating simple charts, with no prior work addressing the creation of complex infographics from text-heavy documents that demand a deep understanding of the content. We address this gap by introducing the task of generating statistical infographics composed of multiple sub-charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are contextually accurate, insightful, and visually aligned. To achieve this, we define infographic metadata that includes its title and textual insights, along with sub-chart-specific details such as their corresponding data and alignment. We also present Infodat, the first benchmark dataset for text-to-infographic metadata generation, where each sample links a document to its metadata. We propose Infogen, a two-stage framework where fine-tuned LLMs first generate metadata, which is then converted into infographic code. Extensive evaluations on Infodat demonstrate that Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both closed and open-source LLMs in text-to-statistical infographic generation.

<div> certification, DNNs, abstract interpretation, compiler, g-BCSR

Summary:
The article addresses the challenge of interpreting deep neural networks (DNNs) by proposing a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level specifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based layer-level implementations. This framework overcomes the semantic gap between design and implementation by introducing a novel stack-based intermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis. The shape analysis infers the implicit tensor operations needed to simulate neuron-level semantics, creating tensors in the minimal shape required for operations. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations exhibit sparsity, which is addressed by the introduction of the g-BCSR double-compression format. This format represents tensors as collections of blocks of varying sizes, each possibly internally sparse. By using this compiler and g-BCSR, developers can easily create new certifiers and analyze their utility across diverse DNNs while achieving performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uninterpretability of DNNs has led to the adoption of abstract interpretation-based certification as a practical means to establish trust in real-world systems that rely on DNNs. However, the current landscape supports only a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing ones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the mathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their implementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch creates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual bridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in formal methods, high-performance computing, etc.
  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level specifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level implementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based intermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit tensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During lifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to perform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific optimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations exhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align well with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a double-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of varying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.
  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and analyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the compiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-augmented generation, Large language models, Knowledge retrieval, Realistic scenarios, Adaptive strategies<br />
Summary:<br />
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge with large language models (LLMs) to improve performance. However, a study using a diverse knowledge datastore called MassiveDS revealed limitations of current RAG systems. It was found that retrieval benefits smaller models more than larger ones and rerankers provide minimal improvement. Additionally, no single retrieval source consistently outperformed others, highlighting the challenge of routing queries across different knowledge sources. These findings underscore the importance of developing adaptive retrieval strategies before implementing RAG in practical applications. The study's code and data are available at https://github.com/ritaranx/RAG_in_the_Wild.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge retrieved at inference time. While RAG demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic, diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models, rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/ritaranx/RAG_in_the_Wild.

<div> Speech language model, prosody, tokenization scheme, pre-training, emerging capabilities
Summary: 
ProsodyLM introduces a novel tokenization scheme for training speech language models to capture the interdependency between content and prosody. Unlike traditional tokenization methods, which convert speech into discrete tokens before inputting into language models, ProsodyLM transcribes speech into text and adds word-level prosody tokens. This approach better retains prosody information and enhances the model's ability to learn prosody processing capabilities through pre-training alone. ProsodyLM demonstrates diverse emerging capabilities, such as detecting prosody nuances like contrastive focus, understanding emotion and stress in speech, and maintaining prosody consistency in longer contexts. This new approach could significantly improve the performance of speech language models in capturing and utilizing prosody information. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long contexts.

Summary: 
The study addresses the lack of resources for Old English in natural language processing by proposing a scalable framework that uses large language models. The framework combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning, data augmentation through backtranslation, and a dual-agent pipeline for content generation and translation. Evaluation using automated metrics and expert human assessment demonstrates significant improvements in translation quality, with BLEU scores soaring from 26 to over 65. The approach not only expands the Old English corpus but also serves as a blueprint for preserving other endangered languages by leveraging AI innovation. This innovative method bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and cultural preservation, showcasing the potential for revitalizing ancient languages using advanced NLP techniques.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Preserving ancient languages is essential for understanding humanity's cultural and linguistic heritage, yet Old English remains critically under-resourced, limiting its accessibility to modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We present a scalable framework that uses advanced large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts, addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning (Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English) and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU, METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of cultural preservation.

<div> Keywords: Generative AI, Direct Preference Optimization, Semantic consistency, Prompt engineering, Language models

Summary: 
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a method used in generative AI to create realistic images from text prompts. However, DPO lacks semantic consistency, leading to prompts drifting from the intended meaning. To address this issue, Sem-DPO is introduced as a variant that maintains semantic consistency while still being efficient. By incorporating cosine distance weighting between prompts and candidates, Sem-DPO prevents semantic drift and ensures prompts stay close to the original text. Empirical results show that Sem-DPO outperforms DPO and other baselines in text-to-image prompt optimization tasks, achieving higher CLIP similarity and human-preference scores. This research suggests that incorporating semantic weighting in prompt optimization studies can significantly improve the quality of generated outputs and paves the way for future developments in semantics-aware preference optimization for language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.
  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO scales the DPO loss by an exponential weight proportional to the cosine distance between the original prompt and winning candidate in embedding space, softly down-weighting training signals that would otherwise reward semantically mismatched prompts. We provide the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12% higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1, PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language models.

Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn (CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems.

Abstract: Document Understanding (DU) in long-contextual scenarios with complex layouts remains a significant challenge in vision-language research. Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation, which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our approach efficiently generates high-quality single- and multi-page questions for extensive English and Arabic documents, covering hundreds of pages across diverse domains. This facilitates the development of LVLMs with enhanced long-context understanding ability. Experimental results in this work have shown that our generated English and Arabic questions (\textbf{AraEngLongBench}) are quite challenging to major open- and close-source LVLMs. The code and data proposed in this work can be found in https://github.com/wangk0b/Multi_Agentic_QA_Long_Doc.git.

Summary:
The article introduces Self-Generated Preference Optimization based on Self-Improver (SGPO), a novel framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Traditional alignment methods rely on off-policy learning and human-annotated datasets, leading to limited applicability and distribution shift issues. SGPO, however, utilizes an on-policy self-improving mechanism where a single model refines responses to self-generate preference data for direct policy optimization. By learning incremental improvements through supervised fine-tuning outputs, SGPO outperforms conventional methods in tasks like AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard without requiring external preference data. This approach not only enhances LLM performance but also addresses challenges in alignment by leveraging self-generated preference data for more reliable deployment. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their extensive pretraining on diverse datasets, require effective alignment to human preferences for practical and reliable deployment. Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy learning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad applicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization based on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages an on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines responses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct preference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and policy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality preference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible improvements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning outputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the proposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline self-improving methods without using external preference data.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the concept of an intention tree and a dataset curation pipeline to address the lack of effective modeling of customer intention in E-commerce product purchase sessions. A new benchmark, SessionIntentBench, is proposed to evaluate the capability of L(V)LMs in understanding inter-session intention shifts. The dataset includes over 1.9 million intention entries and 1.1 million session intention trajectories extracted from 10,905 sessions. Human annotations were used to collect ground-truth labels for evaluation. Experiments show that current L(V)LMs struggle to capture and utilize intention in complex session settings, but injecting intention can improve their performance. This work provides a scalable approach to leveraging session data for customer intention understanding. <div>
arXiv:2507.20185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Session history is a common way of recording user interacting behaviors throughout a browsing activity with multiple products. For example, if an user clicks a product webpage and then leaves, it might because there are certain features that don't satisfy the user, which serve as an important indicator of on-the-spot user preferences. However, all prior works fail to capture and model customer intention effectively because insufficient information exploitation and only apparent information like descriptions and titles are used. There is also a lack of data and corresponding benchmark for explicitly modeling intention in E-commerce product purchase sessions. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of an intention tree and propose a dataset curation pipeline. Together, we construct a sibling multimodal benchmark, SessionIntentBench, that evaluates L(V)LMs' capability on understanding inter-session intention shift with four subtasks. With 1,952,177 intention entries, 1,132,145 session intention trajectories, and 13,003,664 available tasks mined using 10,905 sessions, we provide a scalable way to exploit the existing session data for customer intention understanding. We conduct human annotations to collect ground-truth label for a subset of collected data to form an evaluation gold set. Extensive experiments on the annotated data further confirm that current L(V)LMs fail to capture and utilize the intention across the complex session setting. Further analysis show injecting intention enhances LLMs' performances.

<div> Keywords: Large reasoning models, subjective reasoning tasks, diversity-enhanced framework, reinforcement learning, diversity and accuracy.

Summary: 
Large reasoning models with long chain-of-thought capabilities have shown strong performance on objective tasks but struggle with subjective questions due to homogeneous reasoning. To address this limitation, MultiRole-R1 introduces a diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives for subjective reasoning tasks. It generates diverse reasoning chains through unsupervised data construction and utilizes Group Relative Policy Optimization in reinforcement learning with diversity as a reward signal. By promoting perspective and lexical diversity, MultiRole-R1 improves both accuracy and diversity in reasoning. Experimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MultiRole-R1 in enhancing both subjective and objective reasoning. This study highlights the importance of diversity-enhanced training in large reasoning models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced training in LRMs.

Abstract: Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) rely on benchmark scores, but it is difficult to interpret what these individual scores reveal about a model's overall skills. Specifically, as a community we lack understanding of how tasks relate to one another, what they measure in common, how they differ, or which ones are redundant. As a result, models are often assessed via a single score averaged across benchmarks, an approach that fails to capture the models' wholistic strengths and limitations. Here, we propose a new evaluation paradigm that uses factor analysis to identify latent skills driving performance across benchmarks. We apply this method to a comprehensive new leaderboard showcasing the performance of 60 LLMs on 44 tasks, and identify a small set of latent skills that largely explain performance. Finally, we turn these insights into practical tools that identify redundant tasks, aid in model selection, and profile models along each latent skill.

Summary:
News recommendation systems are important for delivering personalized news content and addressing information overload. The challenge lies in effectively modeling multi-view news representations and dynamic user interests, spanning short- and long-term preferences. Existing methods often fall short in capturing comprehensive user preferences across different time scales. To address this, Co-NAML-LSTUR is proposed, a hybrid framework combining NAML for multi-view news modeling, LSTUR for dual-scale user representations, and BERT-based word embeddings for semantic feature extraction. Evaluation on MIND-small and MIND-large benchmarks shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. This highlights the effectiveness of integrating multi-view news representations with dual-scale user modeling.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: News recommendation systems play a vital role in mitigating information overload by delivering personalized news content. A central challenge is to effectively model both multi-view news representations and the dynamic nature of user interests, which often span both short- and long-term preferences. Existing methods typically rely on single-view features of news articles (e.g., titles or categories) or fail to comprehensively capture user preferences across time scales. In this work, we propose Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news modeling and LSTUR for capturing both long- and short-term user representations. Our model also incorporates BERT-based word embeddings to enhance semantic feature extraction. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Experimental results show that Co-NAML-LSTUR achieves substantial improvements over most state-of-the-art baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale user modeling. The implementation of our model is publicly available at https://github.com/MinhNguyenDS/Co-NAML-LSTUR.

Summary: 
The article discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) in providing mental health support, particularly in the context of narrative therapy. A new framework is proposed, consisting of two core components: INT (Interactive Narrative Therapist) and IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment). INT simulates expert narrative therapists by guiding therapeutic stages and generating expert-like responses. IMA tracks "Innovative Moments" (IMs) in client speech to assess therapy progress. Experimental results show that INT outperforms standard LLMs in therapeutic quality and depth. The framework aims to address the limitations of current approaches in simulating specialized psychotherapy and capturing therapeutic progression over time. The effectiveness of INT is demonstrated in facilitating social applications and synthesizing high-quality support conversations. <div>

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over time. Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking "Innovative Moments" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and 230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social applications.

Summary:
Professionalism in expert communication, especially in fields like finance, is essential yet not fully explored. This study delves into how linguistic attributes can aid in modeling and assessing professionalism in expert questioning. A unique annotation framework was developed to measure structural and pragmatic components in financial analyst questions. Two datasets were created, one annotated for perceived professionalism and the other labeled by question origin, using both human and large language model-generated questions. The research revealed that specific linguistic features strongly correlate with human judgments and question authorship, indicating a common stylistic basis. A classifier trained solely on these features outperformed existing baselines in identifying expert-authored questions. The study suggests that professionalism can be effectively represented through linguistically grounded modeling, highlighting its learnable nature across domains. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Professionalism is a crucial yet underexplored dimension of expert communication, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance. This paper investigates how linguistic features can be leveraged to model and evaluate professionalism in expert questioning. We introduce a novel annotation framework to quantify structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst questions, such as discourse regulators, prefaces, and request types. Using both human-authored and large language model (LLM)-generated questions, we construct two datasets: one annotated for perceived professionalism and one labeled by question origin. We show that the same linguistic features correlate strongly with both human judgments and authorship origin, suggesting a shared stylistic foundation. Furthermore, a classifier trained solely on these interpretable features outperforms gemini-2.0 and SVM baselines in distinguishing expert-authored questions. Our findings demonstrate that professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be captured through linguistically grounded modeling.

<div> Keywords: language model, training, post-completion learning, reinforcement learning, output quality <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Post-Completion Learning (PCL), a novel training framework for language models that leverages the space after output completion to enhance reasoning and self-evaluation abilities. PCL involves continuing to generate self-assessments and reward predictions during training while maintaining efficient inference by stopping at the completion point. By utilizing a white-box reinforcement learning method, models evaluate output content and align scores with reward functions for supervision. This dual-track approach optimizes reasoning and evaluation capabilities and combines them with reinforcement learning for multi-objective hybrid optimization. Experimental results across various datasets and models demonstrate improvements over traditional Structured Self-Training (SFT) and reinforcement learning methods. The method provides a new technical pathway for training language models to enhance output quality while ensuring deployment efficiency. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon reaching the end-of-sequence (}) token, overlooking the potential learning opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning (PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while preserving deployment efficiency.

<div> demographics, behavioral attributes, implicit opinion, alignment evaluation framework, inclusive representation

Summary: 
This study addresses the need for more inclusive representations in conversation-based models by focusing on implicit opinions and evaluating normative alignment through the stance of responses. Existing methods often overlook implicit expressions of opinion, leading to misalignment and reinforcing harmful stereotypes. The proposed framework evaluates how opinions are represented in NLP models, utilizing the stance of responses to capture diverse social viewpoints. The study utilizes positive-unlabeled online learning with base classifiers and instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment, shedding light on how implicit opinions are (mis) represented and offering a pathway towards more inclusive model behavior. <div>
arXiv:2507.20264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair participation and reflections of values is at the core of many conversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface inclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social groups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion embedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can exacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations in model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable inclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the stance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to evaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by introducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often overlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and discourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the underlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of diverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i) positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii) instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through this, we provide a lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer a pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, sequential environmental feedback, chain-of-thought reasoning, MoL-RL, multi-step interactions 

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in effectively utilizing sequential environmental feedback (EF) for chain-of-thought reasoning. Existing methods struggle to capture the rich contextual information in EF signals. To address this, MoL-RL integrates multi-step EF signals into LLMs using a dual-objective optimization framework. It employs MoL continual training to optimize domain-specific EF signals and general language capabilities separately, while utilizing GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions. This approach enables robust feedback-independent reasoning without external feedback loops. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that MoL-RL with the Qwen3-8B model achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization across model scales. This work presents a promising method to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities through multi-step textual feedback integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization framework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training, which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss) and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence), with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into single-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent reasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation (CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization across model scales (Qwen3-4B). This work provides a promising approach for leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities in diverse domains.

Summary:  
1. Aya-23-8B, a decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) trained on balanced multilingual data, demonstrates superior performance in handling code-mixed, cloze, and translation tasks compared to predominantly monolingual models like Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2.  
2. The model activates typologically related language representations during translation, unlike English-centric models that rely on a single pivot language.  
3. Neuron activation patterns in Aya-23 vary with mixing rates and are influenced more by the base language than the mixed-in language in code-mixed tasks.  
4. Language-specific neurons in Aya-23 for code-mixed inputs are concentrated in final layers, deviating from previous findings on decoder-only models.  
5. Analysis shows that script similarity and typological relations impact language processing across different model types.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at multilingual tasks, yet their internal language processing remains poorly understood. We analyze how Aya-23-8B, a decoder-only LLM trained on balanced multilingual data, handles code-mixed, cloze, and translation tasks compared to predominantly monolingual models like Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2. Using logit lens and neuron specialization analyses, we find: (1) Aya-23 activates typologically related language representations during translation, unlike English-centric models that rely on a single pivot language; (2) code-mixed neuron activation patterns vary with mixing rates and are shaped more by the base language than the mixed-in one; and (3) Aya-23's languagespecific neurons for code-mixed inputs concentrate in final layers, diverging from prior findings on decoder-only models. Neuron overlap analysis further shows that script similarity and typological relations impact processing across model types. These findings reveal how multilingual training shapes LLM internals and inform future cross-lingual transfer research.

<div> Keywords: Dialectal Arabic, Machine Translation, Natural Language Processing, Prompting Techniques, Fine-tuning Pipeline

Summary:<br /><br />Dialectal Arabic (DA) presents challenges for natural language processing due to its differences from Modern Standard Arabic. This paper introduces new techniques to improve DA-MSA translation for Levantine, Egyptian, and Gulf dialects in low-resource settings. Six large language models were evaluated for prompting strategies, with GPT-4o achieving the best performance. A quantized Gemma2-9B model outperformed zero-shot GPT-4o in fine-tuning, with 4-bit quantization reducing memory usage. Joint multi-dialect trained models showed significant performance gains over single-dialect models. The study provides a practical pathway for enhancing dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, demonstrating the feasibility of high-quality DA-MSA machine translation with limited resources. This research has implications for improving access to digital services and educational resources in dialectal Arabic-speaking regions. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.20301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This linguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources and impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian, and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained settings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and our proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across all prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a CHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over 10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than 1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.

Summary: 
DYNARTmo is a dynamic articulatory model that visualizes speech articulation processes in a two-dimensional midsagittal plane. It is based on the UK-DYNAMO framework and incorporates articulatory underspecification, segmental and gestural control, and coarticulation principles. The model simulates six key articulators using continuous and discrete control parameters, enabling the generation of vocalic and consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is part of a web-based application called SpeechArticulationTrainer, which includes sagittal, glottal, and palatal views for use in phonetics education and speech therapy. Future work will focus on dynamic movement generation and integration with articulatory-acoustic modules. This research contributes to the understanding and visualization of speech articulation processes for educational and therapeutic purposes.

arXiv:2507.20352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding potential for role-playing applications. Evaluating these capabilities is becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a \textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to isolated Q&amp;A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric} bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000 dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All code and datasets will be released soon.

arXiv:2507.20398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various tasks, that are learned from massive amounts of text-based data. Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output length without any external control.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps models think step by step. But what happens when they must see, understand, and judge-all at once? In visual tasks grounded in social context, where bridging perception with norm-grounded judgments is essential, flat CoT often breaks down. We introduce Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that scaffolds VLM reasoning through three cognitively inspired stages: perception, situation, and norm. Our experiments show that, across multiple multimodal benchmarks (including intent disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety), CoCoT consistently outperforms CoT and direct prompting (+8\% on average). Our findings demonstrate that cognitively grounded reasoning stages enhance interpretability and social awareness in VLMs, paving the way for safer and more reliable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models have made significant strides in image captioning, yet they still lag behind their English counterparts due to limited multilingual training data and costly large-scale model parameterization. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by conditioning caption generation on retrieved examples in the target language, reducing the need for extensive multilingual training. However, multilingual RAG captioning models often depend on retrieved captions translated from English, which can introduce mismatches and linguistic biases relative to the source language. We introduce CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model that integrates retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, enhancing the contextualization of the input image and grounding the captioning process across different languages. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset indicate that CONCAP enables strong performance on low- and mid-resource languages, with highly reduced data requirements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of concept-aware retrieval augmentation in bridging multilingual performance gaps.

<title>Survey of NLU Benchmarks Diagnosing Linguistic Phenomena: Why not Standardize Diagnostics Benchmarks?</title>

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a basic task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending research topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in the development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks and datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public leaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed for investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of linguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on their diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We present a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth error analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted that there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a standard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we formulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the evaluation diagnostics benchmarks: "Why do not we have an evaluation standard for the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?" similar to ISO standard in industry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered linguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy for linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for diagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing the results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.

<title>CodeNER: Code Prompting for Named Entity Recognition</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition (NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels, they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly, ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts, we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English, Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting further improves performance.

<title>Speaking in Words, Thinking in Logic: A Dual-Process Framework in QA Systems</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts. However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law, users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating natural language into formal logic representations.
  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.
  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.

Abstract: Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks, inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies, and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.

Abstract: The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by \textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs. SAND-Math dataset is released here: \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/amd/SAND-MATH}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/amd/SAND-MATH}

Abstract: We introduce a novel multi-labeled scheme for joint annotation of hate and counter-hate speech in social media conversations, categorizing hate and counter-hate messages into thematic and rhetorical dimensions. The thematic categories outline different discursive aspects of each type of speech, while the rhetorical dimension captures how hate and counter messages are communicated, drawing on Aristotle's Logos, Ethos and Pathos. We annotate a sample of 92 conversations, consisting of 720 tweets, and conduct statistical analyses, incorporating public metrics, to explore patterns of interaction between the thematic and rhetorical dimensions within and between hate and counter-hate speech. Our findings provide insights into the spread of hate messages on social media, the strategies used to counter them, and their potential impact on online behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to generate plausible text on online platforms, without revealing the generation process. As users increasingly encounter such black-box outputs, detecting hallucinations has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.

Abstract: We present ZSE-Cap (Zero-Shot Ensemble for Captioning), our 4th place system in Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) shared task on article-grounded image retrieval and captioning. Our zero-shot approach requires no finetuning on the competition's data. For retrieval, we ensemble similarity scores from CLIP, SigLIP, and DINOv2. For captioning, we leverage a carefully engineered prompt to guide the Gemma 3 model, enabling it to link high-level events from the article to the visual content in the image. Our system achieved a final score of 0.42002, securing a top-4 position on the private test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining foundation models through ensembling and prompting.

arXiv:2507.20614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment, and trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal wellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content after it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful behaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user recidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field remains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing methods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB prediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm detection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral risk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks differ by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In addition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine learning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset characteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights methodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and limited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including multilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop systems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims to guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB prediction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge. We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs) that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards, which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e., the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO. Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K.

<title>When Scale Meets Diversity: Evaluating Language Models on Fine-Grained Multilingual Claim Verification</title>

Abstract: The rapid spread of multilingual misinformation requires robust automated fact verification systems capable of handling fine-grained veracity assessments across diverse languages. While large language models have shown remarkable capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity categories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo) using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of 16.9%. This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art (41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact verification. Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior, including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings. These findings suggest that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.

<title>Text2VLM: Adapting Text-Only Datasets to Evaluate Alignment Training in Visual Language Models</title>

arXiv:2507.20704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities, Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse, real-world applications.

<title>Investigating Structural Pruning and Recovery Techniques for Compressing Multimodal Large Language Models: An Empirical Study</title>

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs), but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training. Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training, finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance. Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or sufficient data.

arXiv:2507.20752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for automatic evaluation systems, particularly to address the challenge of information hallucination. Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches have shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require expensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As LLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for accurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without extensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for Multilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic multilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language fine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an LLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific evaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines, including state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based approaches.

<title>On The Role of Pretrained Language Models in General-Purpose Text Embeddings: A Survey</title>

Abstract: Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives, and data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such as multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.

<title>Automating Thematic Review of Prevention of Future Deaths Reports: Replicating the ONS Child Suicide Study using Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to identify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\leq$ 18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process based entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully automated, open source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit) could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD Toolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72 child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the child-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's $\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one that can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health and safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.

<title>Latent Inter-User Difference Modeling for LLM Personalization</title>

arXiv:2507.20849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily lives, leading to a growing demand for personalized outputs. Previous work focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues, we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DEP.

arXiv:2507.20858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of diversity has received increased consideration in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. This is due to various motivations like promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and increasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in an ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where this notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from the past 6 years, with "diversity" or "diverse" in their title. We find a wide range of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized and using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why, what on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are cast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3 dimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends which emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study paves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should bring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between various approaches.

Abstract: Medical reports contain rich clinical information but are often unstructured and written in domain-specific language, posing challenges for information extraction. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed \texttt{llm\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models, Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results, while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters. This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones -- underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the activation space.

Abstract: This work introduces MediQAl, a French medical question answering dataset designed to evaluate the capabilities of language models in factual medical recall and reasoning over real-world clinical scenarios. MediQAl contains 32,603 questions sourced from French medical examinations across 41 medical subjects. The dataset includes three tasks: (i) Multiple-Choice Question with Unique answer, (ii) Multiple-Choice Question with Multiple answer, and (iii) Open-Ended Question with Short-Answer. Each question is labeled as Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with 14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial gap in multilingual resources for the medical domain.

Abstract: Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks (EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask 1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models (LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks. SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles, can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and Spanish and 6th for Spanish.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4, Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8% improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2% drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/pegasi-ai/fine-grained-editting.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings, we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and even maintains or improves quality.

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data, using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning.
  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3) Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns at higher ranks.
  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large language models while managing data privacy concerns.

<title>Multi-Agent-as-Judge: Aligning LLM-Agent-Based Automated Evaluation with Multi-Dimensional Human Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world NLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse human perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and costly, the emerging "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm sheds light on a promising approach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet, to date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona descriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are not generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose MAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically construct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant text documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the personas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate multi-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational and medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results that better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional automated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.

Abstract: People increasingly rely on AI-advice when making decisions. At times, such advice can promote selfish behavior. When individuals abide by selfishness-promoting AI advice, how are they perceived and punished? To study this question, we build on theories from social psychology and combine machine-behavior and behavioral economic approaches. In a pre-registered, financially-incentivized experiment, evaluators could punish real decision-makers who (i) received AI, human, or no advice. The advice (ii) encouraged selfish or prosocial behavior, and decision-makers (iii) behaved selfishly or, in a control condition, behaved prosocially. Evaluators further assigned responsibility to decision-makers and their advisors. Results revealed that (i) prosocial behavior was punished very little, whereas selfish behavior was punished much more. Focusing on selfish behavior, (ii) compared to receiving no advice, selfish behavior was penalized more harshly after prosocial advice and more leniently after selfish advice. Lastly, (iii) whereas selfish decision-makers were seen as more responsible when they followed AI compared to human advice, punishment between the two advice sources did not vary. Overall, behavior and advice content shape punishment, whereas the advice source does not.

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead. Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning (FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator (FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings. Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL network.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human, adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text, bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences, followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR. By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to 6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models' intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) uses various tools and techniques to help developers achieve functional and error-free code faster. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity as components in APR tool chains because of their performance and flexibility. However, training such models requires a significant amount of resources. Fine-tuning techniques have been developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and enhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from scratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments provide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs pre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks (i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs with varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder, Bloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning, full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and IA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking performance of various models due to different data distributions and overfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict models in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.

Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network (FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot collaborative task performance.

Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models (LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134 patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79% to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved (LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

Abstract: Recently, competition in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has intensified among major technological companies, resulting in the continuous release of new large-language models (LLMs) that exhibit improved language understanding and context-based reasoning capabilities. It is expected that these advances will enable more efficient personalized recommendations in LLM-based recommendation systems through improved quality of training data and architectural design. However, many studies have not considered these recent developments. In this study, it was proposed to improve LLM-based recommendation systems by replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec framework. To ensure a fair comparison, random seed values were set and identical input data was provided during preprocessing and training. The experimental results show average performance improvements of 38.65\%, 8.69\%, and 8.19\% for the ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively, thus confirming the practicality of this method. Notably, the significant improvements achieved by model replacement indicate that the recommendation quality can be improved cost-effectively without the need to make structural changes to the system. Based on these results, it is our contention that the proposed approach is a viable solution for improving the performance of current recommendation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), yet their environmental costs remain dangerously overlooked. This article critiques the sustainability of LLMs, quantifying their carbon footprint, water usage, and contribution to e-waste through case studies of models such as GPT-4 and energy-efficient alternatives like Mistral 7B. Training a single LLM can emit carbon dioxide equivalent to hundreds of cars driven annually, while data centre cooling exacerbates water scarcity in vulnerable regions. Systemic challenges corporate greenwashing, redundant model development, and regulatory voids perpetuate harm, disproportionately burdening marginalized communities in the Global South. However, pathways exist for sustainable NLP: technical innovations (e.g., model pruning, quantum computing), policy reforms (carbon taxes, mandatory emissions reporting), and cultural shifts prioritizing necessity over novelty. By analysing industry leaders (Google, Microsoft) and laggards (Amazon), this work underscores the urgency of ethical accountability and global cooperation. Without immediate action, AIs ecological toll risks outpacing its societal benefits. The article concludes with a call to align technological progress with planetary boundaries, advocating for equitable, transparent, and regenerative AI systems that prioritize both human and environmental well-being.

Abstract: Existing Log Anomaly Detection (LogAD) methods are often slow, dependent on error-prone parsing, and use unrealistic evaluation protocols. We introduce $K^4$, an unsupervised and parser-independent framework for high-performance online detection. $K^4$ transforms arbitrary log embeddings into compact four-dimensional descriptors (Precision, Recall, Density, Coverage) using efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) statistics. These descriptors enable lightweight detectors to accurately score anomalies without retraining. Using a more realistic online evaluation protocol, $K^4$ sets a new state-of-the-art (AUROC: 0.995-0.999), outperforming baselines by large margins while being orders of magnitude faster, with training under 4 seconds and inference as low as 4 $\mu$s.

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation, eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

<title>The Devil is in the EOS: Sequence Training for Detailed Image Captioning</title>

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys. Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses, scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while consuming significantly less energy.

<title>The Policy Cliff: A Theoretical Analysis of Reward-Policy Maps in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics. This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Scientific research increasingly relies on specialized computational tools, yet effectively utilizing these tools demands substantial domain expertise. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in tool automation, they struggle to seamlessly integrate and orchestrate multiple tools for complex scientific workflows. Here, we present SciToolAgent, an LLM-powered agent that automates hundreds of scientific tools across biology, chemistry, and materials science. At its core, SciToolAgent leverages a scientific tool knowledge graph that enables intelligent tool selection and execution through graph-based retrieval-augmented generation. The agent also incorporates a comprehensive safety-checking module to ensure responsible and ethical tool usage. Extensive evaluations on a curated benchmark demonstrate that SciToolAgent significantly outperforms existing approaches. Case studies in protein engineering, chemical reactivity prediction, chemical synthesis, and metal-organic framework screening further demonstrate SciToolAgent's capability to automate complex scientific workflows, making advanced research tools accessible to both experts and non-experts.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading is a challenging task requiring the integration of heterogeneous data from multiple modalities. Traditional deep learning and reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present \textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.

Abstract: A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation. Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy. Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies, restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's judgment on "precedents", which are the reasoning processes of prior data points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming (ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across 19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent deployment.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.
  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in non-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding, mathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6, 49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without extended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable open-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering and agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints to facilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence.

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition (ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes, mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

<title>Enhancing Project-Specific Code Completion by Inferring Internal API Information</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Project-specific code completion is a critical task that leverages context from a project to generate accurate code. State-of-the-art methods use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and project information for code completion. However, they often struggle to incorporate internal API information, which is crucial for accuracy, especially when APIs are not explicitly imported in the file.
  To address this, we propose a method to infer internal API information without relying on imports. Our method extends the representation of APIs by constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge base for LLMs to generate relevant completions. We also introduce ProjBench, a benchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world projects.
  Experiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by 22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Additionally, integrating our method with existing baselines boosts code match by 47.80% and identifier match by 35.55%.

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations. Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose $A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework, enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset, Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$ significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core components during inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and color-based identities.

Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models. These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence.

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

Abstract: The field of machine learning has recently made significant progress in reducing the requirements for labelled training data when building new models. These `cheaper' learning techniques hold significant potential for the social sciences, where development of large labelled training datasets is often a significant practical impediment to the use of machine learning for analytical tasks. In this article we review three `cheap' techniques that have developed in recent years: weak supervision, transfer learning and prompt engineering. For the latter, we also review the particular case of zero-shot prompting of large language models. For each technique we provide a guide of how it works and demonstrate its application across six different realistic social science applications (two different tasks paired with three different dataset makeups). We show good performance for all techniques, and in particular we demonstrate how prompting of large language models can achieve high accuracy at very low cost. Our results are accompanied by a code repository to make it easy for others to duplicate our work and use it in their own research. Overall, our article is intended to stimulate further uptake of these techniques in the social sciences.

Abstract: The high compute cost associated with pretraining large language models limits their research. Two strategies have emerged to address this issue: domain specialization and pretraining with high-quality data. To explore these strategies, we specialized the Mistral-7B model with 1.9 billion unique tokens from reputable Brazilian legal sources and conducted few-shot evaluations on legal and general knowledge test suites. Our model, Juru, demonstrates the benefits of domain specialization by achieving improved performance on legal benchmarks, even with a reduced amount of pretraining data. However, this domain specialization through continued pretraining comes at the cost of increased forgetting in unrelated domains, as evidenced by performance degradation on general knowledge test suites in both Portuguese and English. This study contributes to the growing body of scientific evidence showing that pretraining data selection may enhance the performance of large language models, enabling the exploration of these models at a lower cost. Juru is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/roseval/Juru-7B .

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), optimized through human feedback, have rapidly emerged as a leading paradigm for developing intelligent conversational assistants. However, despite their strong performance across many benchmarks, LLM-based agents might still lack conversational skills such as disambiguation -- when they are faced with ambiguity, they often overhedge or implicitly guess users' true intents rather than asking clarification questions. Under task-specific settings, high-quality conversation samples are often limited, constituting a bottleneck for LLMs' ability to learn optimal dialogue action policies. We propose Action-Based Contrastive Self-Training (ACT), a quasi-online preference optimization algorithm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), that enables data-efficient dialogue policy learning in multi-turn conversation modeling. We demonstrate ACT's efficacy under in data-efficient tuning scenarios, even when there is no action label available, using multiple real-world conversational tasks: tabular-grounded question-answering, machine reading comprehension, and AmbigSQL, a novel task for disambiguating information-seeking requests for complex SQL generation towards data analysis agents. Additionally, we propose evaluating LLMs' ability to function as conversational agents by examining whether they can implicitly recognize and reason about ambiguity in conversation. ACT demonstrates substantial conversation modeling improvements over standard tuning approaches like supervised fine-tuning and DPO.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may exhibit unintended or undesirable behaviors. Recent works have concentrated on aligning LLMs to mitigate harmful outputs. Despite these efforts, some anomalies indicate that even a well-conducted alignment process can be easily circumvented, whether intentionally or accidentally. Does alignment fine-tuning yield have robust effects on models, or are its impacts merely superficial? In this work, we make the first exploration of this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Empirically, we demonstrate the $\mathbf{elasticity}$ of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Leveraging compression theory, we formally deduce that fine-tuning disproportionately undermines alignment relative to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We validate the presence of elasticity through experiments on models of varying types and scales. Specifically, we find that model performance declines rapidly before reverting to the pre-training distribution, after which the rate of decline drops significantly. Furthermore, we further reveal that elasticity positively correlates with the increased model size and the expansion of pre-training data. Our findings underscore the need to address the inherent elasticity of LLMs to mitigate their resistance to alignment. The model weight and code are available at pku-lm-resist-alignment.github.io.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance on tasks involving long contexts remains sub-optimal. In this work, we propose DoubleDipper, a novel In-Context-Learning method that automatically generates few-shot examples for long context QA tasks by recycling contexts. Specifically, given a long input context (1-3k tokens) and a query, we generate additional query-output pairs from the given context as few-shot examples, while introducing the context only once. This ensures that the demonstrations are leveraging the same context as the target query while only adding a small number of tokens to the prompt. We further enhance each demonstration by instructing the model to explicitly identify the relevant paragraphs before the answer, which improves performance while providing fine-grained attribution to the answer source. We apply our method on multiple LLMs and obtain substantial improvements (+16 absolute points on average across models) on various QA datasets with long context. Surprisingly, despite introducing only single-hop ICL examples, LLMs successfully generalize to multi-hop long-context QA using our approach.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) poses significant challenges due to domain gap, limited data, and stringent hardware constraints. In this study, we evaluate four adapter techniques-Adapter, Lightweight, TinyAttention, and Gated Residual Network (GRN) - equivalent to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for clinical note classification under real-world, resource-constrained conditions. All experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA Quadro P620 GPU (2 GB VRAM, 512 CUDA cores, 1.386 TFLOPS FP32), limiting batch sizes to <8 sequences and maximum sequence length to 256 tokens. Our clinical corpus comprises only 580 000 tokens, several orders of magnitude smaller than standard LLM pre-training datasets. We fine-tuned three biomedical pre-trained LLMs (CamemBERT-bio, AliBERT, DrBERT) and two lightweight Transformer models trained from scratch. Results show that 1) adapter structures provide no consistent gains when fine-tuning biomedical LLMs under these constraints, and 2) simpler Transformers, with minimal parameter counts and training times under six hours, outperform adapter-augmented LLMs, which required over 1000 GPU-hours. Among adapters, GRN achieved the best metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 = 0.88). These findings demonstrate that, in low-resource clinical settings with limited data and compute, lightweight Transformers trained from scratch offer a more practical and efficient solution than large LLMs, while GRN remains a viable adapter choice when minimal adaptation is needed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) often need to be Continual Pre-Trained (CPT) to obtain unfamiliar language skills or adapt to new domains. The huge training cost of CPT often asks for cautious choice of key hyper-parameters such as the mixture ratio of extra language or domain corpus. However, there is no systematic study that bridges the gap between the optimal mixture ratio and the actual model performance, and the gap between experimental scaling law and the actual deployment in the full model size. In this paper, we perform CPT on Llama-3 8B and 70B to enhance its Chinese ability. We study the optimal correlation between the Additional Language Mixture Ratio (ALMR) and the Learning Rate (LR) on the 8B size which directly indicates the optimal experimental setup. By thorough choice of hyper-parameter, and subsequent fine-tuning, the model capability is improved not only on the Chinese-related benchmark but also in some specific domains including math, coding, and emotional intelligence. We deploy the final 70B version of LLM on a real-life chat system which obtains satisfying performance.

Abstract: Current research efforts are focused on enhancing the thinking and reasoning capability of large language model (LLM) by prompting, data-driven emergence and inference-time computation. In this study, we consider stimulating language model's thinking and cognitive abilities from a modular perspective, which mimics the human brain architecture. We select a specific intermediate attention layer with newly implemented language heads. We conduct dual-layer fine-tuning by annotated (query, thought, answer) samples and show that the intermediate layer can also learn to decode fluent and reasonable language tokens. A two-pass inference mechanism is designed to generate thoughts then formal responses. The entire framework is called modularized thinking language model (MeTHanol) which can enhance LLM's cognitive behaviors as indicated by Theory of Mind (ToM) and Vignette-based experiments. Case studies also show that MeTHanol can plan and self-reflect and generate human-like thoughts and answers, even on unseen and open-domain tasks. MeTHanol can also adapt to a personalized prompt and behave as the specified character. Our study holds promise for significant cognitive gains from a modular perspective.

Abstract: We show that existing evaluations for assessing the factuality of news from conventional sources, such as claims on fact-checking websites, result in high accuracies over time for LLM-based detectors-even after their knowledge cutoffs. This suggests that recent popular false information from such sources can be easily identified due to its likely presence in pre-training/retrieval corpora or the emergence of salient, yet shallow, patterns in these datasets. Instead, we argue that a proper factuality evaluation dataset should test a model's ability to reason about current events by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, we develop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from a RAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive variants that challenge LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binary classification ROC-AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG-based GPT-4o detector. Our experiments reveal the important role of RAG in both evaluating and generating challenging news examples, as retrieval-free LLM detectors are vulnerable to unseen events and adversarial attacks, while feedback from RAG-based evaluation helps discover more deceitful patterns.

<title>Do Large Language Models Have an English Accent? Evaluating and Improving the Naturalness of Multilingual LLMs</title>

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly designed with English as the primary language, and even the few that are multilingual tend to exhibit strong English-centric biases. Much like speakers who might produce awkward expressions when learning a second language, LLMs often generate unnatural outputs in non-English languages, reflecting English-centric patterns in both vocabulary and grammar. Despite the importance of this issue, the naturalness of multilingual LLM outputs has received limited attention. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing novel automatic corpus-level metrics to assess the lexical and syntactic naturalness of LLM outputs in a multilingual context. Using our new metrics, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated benchmark in French and Chinese, revealing a tendency towards English-influenced patterns. To mitigate this issue, we also propose a simple and effective alignment method to improve the naturalness of an LLM in a target language and domain, achieving consistent improvements in naturalness without compromising the performance on general-purpose benchmarks. Our work highlights the importance of developing multilingual metrics, resources and methods for the new wave of multilingual LLMs.

<title>What is Wrong with Perplexity for Long-context Language Modeling?</title>

Abstract: Handling long-context inputs is crucial for large language models (LLMs) in tasks such as extended conversations, document summarization, and many-shot in-context learning. While recent approaches have extended the context windows of LLMs and employed perplexity (PPL) as a standard evaluation metric, PPL has proven unreliable for assessing long-context capabilities. The underlying cause of this limitation has remained unclear. In this work, we provide a comprehensive explanation for this issue. We find that PPL overlooks key tokens, which are essential for long-context understanding, by averaging across all tokens and thereby obscuring the true performance of models in long-context scenarios. To address this, we propose \textbf{LongPPL}, a novel metric that focuses on key tokens by employing a long-short context contrastive method to identify them. Our experiments demonstrate that LongPPL strongly correlates with performance on various long-context benchmarks (e.g., Pearson correlation of -0.96), significantly outperforming traditional PPL in predictive accuracy. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{LongCE} (Long-context Cross-Entropy) loss, a re-weighting strategy for fine-tuning that prioritizes key tokens, leading to consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks. In summary, these contributions offer deeper insights into the limitations of PPL and present effective solutions for accurately evaluating and enhancing the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/LongPPL.

Abstract: Global partisan hostility and polarization has increased, and this polarization is heightened around presidential elections. Models capable of generating accurate summaries of diverse perspectives can help reduce such polarization by exposing users to alternative perspectives. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset and task for independently summarizing each political perspective in a set of passages from opinionated news articles. For this task, we propose a framework for evaluating different dimensions of perspective summary performance. We benchmark 11 summarization models and LLMs of varying sizes and architectures through both automatic and human evaluation. While recent models like GPT-4o perform well on this task, we find that all models struggle to generate summaries that are faithful to the intended perspective. Our analysis of summaries focuses on how extraction behavior is impacted by features of the input documents.

Abstract: The development and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has primarily focused on their task-solving capabilities, with recent models even surpassing human performance in some areas. However, this focus often neglects whether machine-generated language matches the human level of diversity, in terms of vocabulary choice, syntactic construction, and expression of meaning, raising questions about whether the fundamentals of language generation have been fully addressed. This paper emphasizes the importance of examining the preservation of human linguistic richness by language models, given the concerning surge in online content produced or aided by LLMs. We propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs from various linguistic diversity perspectives including lexical, syntactic, and semantic dimensions. Using this framework, we benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs across all diversity dimensions, and conduct an in-depth case study for syntactic diversity. Finally, we analyze how different development and deployment choices impact the linguistic diversity of LLM outputs.

Abstract: Background: Despite the current ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) across the medical domain, there is a surprising lack of studies which address their reasoning behaviour. We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, in this work, we adapt the existing concept of reasoning behaviour and articulate its interpretation within the specific context of medical LLMs. We survey and categorise current state-of-the-art approaches for modeling and evaluating reasoning reasoning in medical LLMs. Additionally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. We also outline key open challenges facing the development of Large Reasoning Models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole.

Abstract: This work presents a computational approach to analyze character development along the narrative timeline. The analysis characterizes the inner and outer changes the protagonist undergoes within a narrative, and the interplay between them. We consider transcripts of Holocaust survivor testimonies as a test case, each telling the story of an individual in first-person terms. We focus on the survivor's religious trajectory, examining the evolution of their disposition toward religious belief and practice along the testimony. Clustering the resulting trajectories in the dataset, we identify common sequences in the data. Our findings highlight multiple common structures of religiosity across the narratives: in terms of belief, most present a constant disposition, while for practice, most present an oscillating structure, serving as valuable material for historical and sociological research. This work demonstrates the potential of natural language processing techniques for analyzing character evolution through thematic trajectories in narratives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse natural language processing tasks. However, as the model size and the input sequence's length increase, the linearly increasing key-value (KV) cache significantly degrades inference throughput. Therefore, grouped-query attention (GQA), as an alternative to multi-head attention (MHA), has been widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a cost-effective method for converting MHA into GQA with any compression ratio of KV heads. The key point of our method lies in the application of Procrustes analysis to the attention heads, which enhances the similarity among attention heads while preserving computational invariance, thereby improving the model's post-training performance. Subsequently, we employ $\mathit{L_0}$ regularization to prune redundant parameters. The model after pruning can be adapted to the standard GQA framework. Experimental results show that our strategy can compress up to 87.5\% KV heads of LLaMA2-7B model and 75\% KV heads of Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B with acceptable performance degradation. Our code is released at https://github.com/fpcsong/mha2gqa.

Abstract: Efficient preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have become a popular approach in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. These algorithms implicitly treat the LLM as a reward model, and focus on training it to correct misranked preference pairs. However, recent work~\citep{chen2024preference} empirically finds that DPO training \textit{rarely improves these misranked preference pairs}, despite its gradient emphasizing on these cases. We introduce FocalPO, a DPO variant that instead \textit{down-weighs} misranked preference pairs and prioritizes enhancing the model's understanding of pairs that it can already rank correctly. Inspired by Focal Loss used in vision tasks, FocalPO achieves this by adding a modulating factor to dynamically scale DPO loss. Our experiment demonstrates that FocalPO surpasses DPO and its variants on popular benchmarks like Alpaca Eval 2.0 using Mistral-Base-7B and Llama-3-Instruct-8B, with the introduced hyperparameter fixed. Additionally, we empirically reveals how FocalPO affects training on correct and incorrect sample groups, further underscoring its effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent cognitive modeling studies have reported that larger language models (LMs) exhibit a poorer fit to human reading behavior (Oh and Schuler, 2023b; Shain et al., 2024; Kuribayashi et al., 2024), leading to claims of their cognitive implausibility. In this paper, we revisit this argument through the lens of mechanistic interpretability and argue that prior conclusions were skewed by an exclusive focus on the final layers of LMs. Our analysis reveals that next-word probabilities derived from internal layers of larger LMs align with human sentence processing data as well as, or better than, those from smaller LMs. This alignment holds consistently across behavioral (self-paced reading times, gaze durations, MAZE task processing times) and neurophysiological (N400 brain potentials) measures, challenging earlier mixed results and suggesting that the cognitive plausibility of larger LMs has been underestimated. Furthermore, we first identify an intriguing relationship between LM layers and human measures: earlier layers correspond more closely with fast gaze durations, while later layers better align with relatively slower signals such as N400 potentials and MAZE processing times. Our work opens new avenues for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of mechanistic interpretability and cognitive modeling.

Abstract: We challenge the prevailing assumption that complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs) necessitates massive training data. We demonstrate that sophisticated mathematical reasoning can emerge with only a few examples. Specifically, through simple supervised fine-tuning, our model, LIMO, achieves 63.3\% accuracy on AIME24 and 95.6\% on MATH500, surpassing previous fine-tuned models (6.5\% on AIME24, 59.2\% on MATH500) while using only 1\% of the training data required by prior approaches. Furthermore, LIMO exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, achieving a 45.8\% absolute improvement across diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data. Synthesizing these findings, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning can emerge through minimal but strategically designed demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis suggests that the threshold for eliciting complex reasoning is not dictated by task complexity but rather by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's pre-trained knowledge base and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples in serving as "cognitive templates" that guide reasoning.

Abstract: Given the rapid development of Legal AI, a lot of attention has been paid to one of the most important legal AI tasks--similar case retrieval, especially with language models to use. In our paper, however, we try to improve the ranking performance of current models from the perspective of learning to rank instead of language models. Specifically, we conduct experiments using a pairwise method--RankSVM as the classifier to substitute a fully connected layer, combined with commonly used language models on similar case retrieval datasets LeCaRDv1 and LeCaRDv2. We finally come to the conclusion that RankSVM could generally help improve the retrieval performance on the LeCaRDv1 and LeCaRDv2 datasets compared with original classifiers by optimizing the precise ranking. It could also help mitigate overfitting owing to class imbalance. Our code is available in https://github.com/liuyuqi123study/RankSVM_for_SLR

Abstract: Modern text classification methods heavily rely on contextual embeddings from large language models (LLMs). Compared to human-engineered features, these embeddings provide automatic and effective representations for classification model training. However, they also introduce a challenge: we lose the ability to manually remove unintended features, such as sensitive or task-irrelevant features, to guarantee regulatory compliance or improve the generalizability of classification models. This limitation arises because LLM embeddings are opaque and difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to identify and regularize unintended features in the LLM latent space. Specifically, we first pre-train a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to extract interpretable features from LLM latent spaces. To ensure the SAE can capture task-specific features, we further fine-tune it on task-specific datasets. In training the classification model, we propose a simple and effective regularizer, by minimizing the similarity between the classifier weights and the identified unintended feature, to remove the impact of these unintended features on classification. We evaluate the proposed framework on three real-world tasks, including toxic chat detection, reward modeling, and disease diagnosis. Results show that the proposed self-regularization framework can improve the classifier's generalizability by regularizing those features that are not semantically correlated to the task. This work pioneers controllable text classification on LLM latent spaces by leveraging interpreted features to address generalizability, fairness, and privacy challenges. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/JacksonWuxs/Controllable_LLM_Classifier.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated vast capabilities on generative tasks in recent years, yet they struggle with guaranteeing the factual correctness of the generated content. This makes these models unreliable in realistic situations where factually accurate responses are expected. In this paper, we propose FactReasoner, a new factuality assessor that relies on probabilistic reasoning to assess the factuality of a long-form generated response. Specifically, FactReasoner decomposes the response into atomic units, retrieves relevant contexts for them from an external knowledge source, and constructs a joint probability distribution over the atoms and contexts using probabilistic encodings of the logical relationships (entailment, contradiction) between the textual utterances corresponding to the atoms and contexts. FactReasoner then computes the posterior probability of whether atomic units in the response are supported by the retrieved contexts. Our experiments on labeled and unlabeled benchmark datasets demonstrate clearly that FactReasoner improves considerably over state-of-the-art prompt-based approaches in terms of both factual precision and recall.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in open-ended dialogue, yet their inability to retain and retrieve relevant information from long-term interactions limits their effectiveness in applications requiring sustained personalization. External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities-utterances, turns, and sessions-into a personalized memory bank for effective future retrieval, and (2) Retrospective Reflection, which iteratively refines the retrieval in an online reinforcement learning (RL) manner based on LLMs' cited evidence. Experiments show that RMM demonstrates consistent improvement across various metrics and benchmarks. For example, RMM shows more than 10% accuracy improvement over the baseline without memory management on the LongMemEval dataset.

Abstract: With a combination of quantitative experiments, human judgments, and qualitative analyses, we evaluate the quantity and quality of African American Language (AAL) representation in 12 predominantly English, open-source pretraining corpora. We specifically focus on the sources, variation, and naturalness of included AAL texts representing the AAL-speaking community. We find that AAL is underrepresented in all evaluated pretraining corpora compared to US demographics, constituting as few as 0.007% and at most 0.18% of documents. We also find that more than 25% of AAL texts in C4 may be perceived as inappropriate for LLMs to generate and to reinforce harmful stereotypes. Finally, we find that most automated filters are more likely to conserve White Mainstream English (WME) texts over AAL in pretraining corpora.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks requiring multi-step logical reasoning capabilities, such as automated theorem proving. However, challenges persist within theorem proving, such as the identification of key mathematical concepts, understanding their interrelationships, and formalizing proofs correctly within natural language. We present KG-prover, a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs mined from reputable mathematical texts to augment general-purpose LLMs to construct and formalize mathematical proofs. We also study the effects of scaling graph-based, test-time compute using KG-Prover, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines across multiple datasets. General-purpose LLMs improve up to 21\% on miniF2F-test when combined with KG-Prover, with consistent improvements ranging from 2-11\% on the ProofNet, miniF2F-test, and MUSTARD datasets without additional scaling. Furthermore, KG-Prover with o4-mini achieves over 50% miniF2F-test. This work provides a promising approach for augmenting natural language proof reasoning with knowledge graphs without the need for additional finetuning.

Abstract: While it is commonly accepted that maintaining common ground plays a role in conversational success, little prior research exists connecting conversational grounding to success in task-oriented conversations. We study failures of grounding in the Ubuntu IRC dataset, where participants use text-only communication to resolve technical issues. We find that disruptions in conversational flow often stem from a misalignment in common ground, driven by a divergence in beliefs and assumptions held by participants. These disruptions, which we call conversational friction, significantly correlate with task success. We find that although LLMs can identify overt cases of conversational friction, they struggle with subtler and more context-dependent instances requiring pragmatic or domain-specific reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training methodologies for large language models (LLMs) have highlighted reinforcement learning (RL) as a critical component for enhancing reasoning. However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.

Abstract: Advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought transformative capabilities to NLP, but such progress remains unevenly distributed, especially for low-resource and culturally rich languages like Tibetan. In this paper, we present TIB-STC, the first large-scale, expert-curated, and multi-domain benchmark specifically designed to support the development and evaluation of LLMs for the Tibetan language. Spanning over 11 billion tokens across literature, religion, medicine, law, and daily communication, TIB-STC preserves traditional grammar and stylistic richness. To validate its utility, we train a reference model, Sun-Shine, on TIB-STC through a three-stage pipeline involving pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization. Evaluation on TLUE Benchmark for Tibetan-specific tasks, including Ti-MMLU and Ti-SafetyBench, demonstrates the benchmark's effectiveness in enabling robust instruction-following and culturally aligned generation. We release TIB-STC to advance research in low-resource language modeling and promote inclusivity in multilingual NLP. All data are available at: https://github.com/Vicentvankor/sun-shine

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize computational social science, particularly in automated textual analysis. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of the promises and risks associated with using LLMs for text classification tasks, using social movement studies as an example. We propose a framework for social scientists to incorporate LLMs into text annotation, either as the primary coding decision-maker or as a coding assistant. This framework offers researchers tools to develop the potential best-performing prompt, and to systematically examine and report the validity and reliability of LLMs as a methodological tool. Additionally, we evaluate and discuss its epistemic risks associated with validity, reliability, replicability, and transparency. We conclude with several practical guidelines for using LLMs in text annotation tasks and offer recommendations for more effectively communicating epistemic risks in research.

Abstract: Existing Speech Language Model (SLM) scaling analysis paints a bleak picture. It predicts that SLMs require much more compute and data compared to text, leading some to question the feasibility of training high-quality SLMs. However, modern SLMs are often initialised from pre-trained TextLMs using speech-text interleaving to allow knowledge transfer. This raises the question - "Do interleaved SLMs scale more efficiently than textless-SLMs?" In this paper we answer a resounding yes! We conduct scaling analysis of interleaved SLMs by training several dozen and analysing the scaling trends. We see that under this setup SLMs scale more efficiently with compute. Additionally, our results indicate that the scaling dynamics significantly differ from textless-SLMs, suggesting one should allocate notably more of the compute budget to increasing model size over training tokens. We also study the role of synthetic data and TextLM model families in unlocking this potential. Results suggest that our scaled up model achieves comparable semantic speech performance to leading models, while using less compute and data. We open source models, samples, and data - https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/sims/ .

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have led to growing interest in applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to financial problems, enabling new approaches to analysis and decision-making. To systematically examine this trend, we review 374 NLP research papers published between 2017 and 2024 across 38 conferences and workshops, with a focused analysis of 221 papers that directly address finance-related tasks. We evaluate these papers across 11 quantitative and qualitative dimensions, and our study identifies the following opportunities: (i) expanding the scope of forecasting tasks; (ii) enriching evaluation with financial metrics; (iii) leveraging multilingual and crisis-period datasets; and (iv) balancing PLMs with efficient or interpretable alternatives. We identify actionable directions for research and practice, supported by dataset and tool recommendations, with implications for both the academia and industry communities.

Abstract: To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens. We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books, piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus, likely duplication in the training data.
  We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama 3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in aligned LLMs.

<title>When Does Metadata Conditioning (NOT) Work for Language Model Pre-Training? A Study with Context-Free Grammars</title>

Abstract: The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically, through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.

Abstract: One of the goals of fairness research in NLP is to measure and mitigate stereotypical biases that are propagated by NLP systems. However, such work tends to focus on single axes of bias (most often gender) and the English language. Addressing these limitations, we contribute the first study of multilingual intersecting country and gender biases, with a focus on occupation recommendations generated by large language models. We construct a benchmark of prompts in English, Spanish and German, where we systematically vary country and gender, using 25 countries and four pronoun sets. Then, we evaluate a suite of 5 Llama-based models on this benchmark, finding that LLMs encode significant gender and country biases. Notably, we find that even when models show parity for gender or country individually, intersectional occupational biases based on both country and gender persist. We also show that the prompting language significantly affects bias, and instruction-tuned models consistently demonstrate the lowest and most stable levels of bias. Our findings highlight the need for fairness researchers to use intersectional and multilingual lenses in their work.

Abstract: A two stage novel generation framework (outline -> section outline -> manuscript) is widely used in long novel generation,(e.g., \textsc{DOME}, \textsc{Plan\&amp;Write}, \textsc{Long Writer}), but study of such framework in ultra long novel(>1M words) reconstruction is little. Building on recent text compression methods (\textsc{LLMZip}, \textsc{LLM2Vec}), we conduct an information-theoretic analysis to quantify semantic distortion under different compression-expansion ratios. We examine how outline length affects information preservation. Experiments on ultra-long novels show that the optimal compression-expansion ratio significantly reduces semantic distortion compared to other non-optimal compression-expansion ratio.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks emerges as a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate Accidental Vulnerability, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and toxicity across multiple experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial robustness of these fine-tuned models, analyzing persona shifts and interpretability traits to understand how dataset factors contribute to attack success rates. Lastly, we explore causal relationships that offer new insights into adversarial defense strategies, highlighting the crucial role of dataset design in preserving model alignment.

Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems (VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction, and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile, physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue. Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the field of physics.

Abstract: There is a lack of an evaluation methodology that estimates the extent to which large language models (LLMs) use code-switching (CS) in the same way as bilinguals. Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words.

Abstract: The theoretical code-switching (CS) literature provides numerous pointwise investigations that aim to explain patterns in CS, i.e. why bilinguals switch language in certain positions in a sentence more often than in others. A resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language, cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns generalise well to unseen language pairs.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the persistent challenges that figurative language expressions pose for natural language processing (NLP) systems, particularly in low-resource languages such as Konkani. We present a hybrid model that integrates a pre-trained Multilingual BERT (mBERT) with a bidirectional LSTM and a linear classifier. This architecture is fine-tuned on a newly introduced annotated dataset for metaphor classification, developed as part of this work. To improve the model's efficiency, we implement a gradient-based attention head pruning strategy. For metaphor classification, the pruned model achieves an accuracy of 78%. We also applied our pruning approach to expand on an existing idiom classification task, achieving 83% accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of attention head pruning for building efficient NLP tools in underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have examined the social bias of rapidly developed large language models (LLMs). Although most of these studies have focused on bias occurring in a single social attribute, research in social science has shown that social bias often occurs in the form of intersectionality -- the constitutive and contextualized perspective on bias aroused by social attributes. In this study, we construct the Japanese benchmark inter-JBBQ, designed to evaluate the intersectional bias in LLMs on the question-answering setting. Using inter-JBBQ to analyze GPT-4o and Swallow, we find that biased output varies according to its contexts even with the equal combination of social attributes.

Abstract: Disease-symptom datasets are significant and in demand for medical research, disease diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and AI-driven health management applications. These datasets help identify symptom patterns associated with specific diseases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early detection. The dataset presented in this study systematically compiles disease-symptom relationships from various online sources, medical literature, and publicly available health databases. The data was gathered through analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and disease-symptom association reports. Only the verified medical sources were included in the dataset, while those from non-peer-reviewed and anecdotal sources were excluded. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where the first column represents diseases, and the remaining columns represent symptoms. Each symptom cell contains a binary value, indicating whether a symptom is associated with a disease. Thereby, this structured representation makes the dataset very useful for a wide range of applications, including machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical decision support systems, and epidemiological studies. Although there are some advancements in the field of disease-symptom datasets, there is a significant gap in structured datasets for the Bangla language. This dataset aims to bridge that gap by facilitating the development of multilingual medical informatics tools and improving disease prediction models for underrepresented linguistic communities. Further developments should include region-specific diseases and further fine-tuning of symptom associations for better diagnostic performance

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models. Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale language models.

Abstract: Hate speech targeting children on social media is a serious and growing problem, yet current NLP systems struggle to detect it effectively. This gap exists mainly because existing datasets focus on adults, lack age specific labels, miss nuanced linguistic cues, and are often too small for robust modeling. To address this, we introduce ChildGuard, the first large scale English dataset dedicated to hate speech aimed at children. It contains 351,877 annotated examples from X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and YouTube, labeled by three age groups: younger children (under 11), pre teens (11--12), and teens (13--17). The dataset is split into two subsets for fine grained analysis: a contextual subset (157K) focusing on discourse level features, and a lexical subset (194K) emphasizing word-level sentiment and vocabulary.

<title>From Answers to Rationales: Self-Aligning Multimodal Reasoning with Answer-Oriented Chain-of-Thought</title>

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methods primarily focus on synthesizing positive rationales, typically relying on manual annotations or complex systems. Moreover, they often overlook negative reasoning, which limits the model's generalization ability and robustness in multimodal inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning \textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). SMART employs an answer-oriented chain-of-thought (AoT) prompt to automatically construct high-quality data. Drawing inspiration from human proof-based strategies, AoT leverages both correct and incorrect answers to extract key visual information that links questions and answers. When provided with correct answers, the model produces strong positive rationales. Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with incorrect alternatives, the model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior reasoning capabilities. Consequently, SMART establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/WentaoTan/SMART.

<title>Emergent Semantics Beyond Token Embeddings: Transformer LMs with Frozen Visual Unicode Representations</title>

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning, raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, cross evaluations show that our system generalizes well across diverse health misinformation topics and datasets. And human evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality and obtains human preference.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have unveiled great potential as visual assistants. However, most existing works focus on responding to individual instructions or using previous dialogues for contextual understanding. There is little discussion on employing both images and text as in-context examples to enhance the instruction following capability.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{Otter} model to leverage both textual and visual in-context examples for instruction tuning. Specifically, Otter builds upon Flamingo with Perceiver architecture, and has been instruction tuned for general purpose multi-modal assistant. Otter seamlessly processes multi-modal inputs, supporting modalities including text, multiple images, and dynamic video content. To support the training of Otter, we present the \textbf{MIMIC-IT} (\textbf{M}ult\textbf{I}-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{T}uning) dataset, which encompasses over 3 million multi-modal instruction-response pairs, including approximately 2.2 million unique instructions across a broad spectrum of images and videos. MIMIC-IT has been carefully curated to feature a diverse array of in-context examples for each entry.
  Comprehensive evaluations suggest that instruction tuning with these in-context examples substantially enhances model convergence and generalization capabilities. Notably, the extensive scenario coverage provided by the MIMIC-IT dataset empowers the Otter model to excel in tasks involving complex video and multi-image understanding.

Abstract: This paper presents LLM2TEA, a Large Language Model (LLM) driven MultiTask Evolutionary Algorithm, representing the first agentic AI designer of its kind operating with generative evolutionary multitasking (GEM). LLM2TEA enables the crossbreeding of solutions from multiple domains, fostering novel solutions that transcend disciplinary boundaries. Of particular interest is the ability to discover designs that are both novel and conforming to real-world physical specifications. LLM2TEA comprises an LLM to generate genotype samples from text prompts describing target objects, a text-to-3D generative model to produce corresponding phenotypes, a classifier to interpret its semantic representations, and a computational simulator to assess its physical properties. Novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators are introduced to guide the search towards high-performing, practically viable designs. Experimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the effectiveness of LLM2TEA, showing 97% to 174% improvements in the diversity of novel designs over the current text-to-3D baseline. Moreover, over 73% of the generated designs outperform the top 1% of designs produced by the text-to-3D baseline in terms of physical performance. The designs produced by LLM2TEA are not only aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world contexts. Several of these designs have been successfully 3D printed, demonstrating the ability of our approach to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible, physical designs. These designs underscore the potential of LLM2TEA as a powerful tool for complex design optimization and discovery, capable of producing novel and physically viable designs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen substantial growth, necessitating efficient model pruning techniques. Existing post-training pruning methods primarily measure weight importance in converged dense models, often overlooking changes in weight significance during the pruning process, leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we present LLM-Barber (Block-Aware Rebuilder for Sparsity Mask in One-Shot), a novel one-shot pruning framework that rebuilds the sparsity mask of pruned models without any retraining or weight reconstruction. LLM-Barber incorporates block-aware error optimization across Self-Attention and MLP blocks, facilitating global performance optimization. We are the first to employ the product of weights and gradients as a pruning metric in the context of LLM post-training pruning. This enables accurate identification of weight importance in massive models and significantly reduces computational complexity compared to methods using secondorder information. Our experiments show that LLM-Barber efficiently prunes models from LLaMA and OPT families (7B to 13B) on a single A100 GPU in just 30 minutes, achieving state-of-the-art results in both perplexity and zero-shot performance across various language benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/YupengSu/LLM-Barber.

Abstract: Multimodal learning, which involves integrating information from various modalities such as text, images, audio, and video, is pivotal for numerous complex tasks like visual question answering, cross-modal retrieval, and caption generation. Traditional approaches rely on modality-specific encoders and late fusion techniques, which can hinder scalability and flexibility when adapting to new tasks or modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that extends the concept of task reformulation beyond natural language processing (NLP) to multimodal learning. We propose to reformulate diverse multimodal tasks into a unified next-frame prediction problem, allowing a single model to handle different modalities without modality-specific components. This method treats all inputs and outputs as sequential frames in a video, enabling seamless integration of modalities and effective knowledge transfer across tasks. Our approach is evaluated on a range of tasks, including text-to-text, image-to-text, video-to-video, video-to-text, and audio-to-text, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across modalities with minimal adaptation. We show that task reformulation can significantly simplify multimodal model design across various tasks, laying the groundwork for more generalized multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), such as GPT-4o, have recently unlocked audio dialogue capabilities, enabling direct spoken exchanges with humans. The potential of LALMs broadens their applicability across a wide range of practical scenarios supported by audio dialogues. However, given these advancements, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of LALMs in the open-ended audio dialogue understanding remains absent currently. To address this gap, we propose an Audio Dialogue Understanding Benchmark (ADU-Bench), which consists of 4 benchmark datasets. They assess the open-ended audio dialogue ability for LALMs in 3 general scenarios, 12 skills, 9 multilingual languages, and 4 categories of ambiguity handling. Notably, we firstly propose the evaluation of ambiguity handling in audio dialogues that expresses different intentions beyond the same literal meaning of sentences, e.g., "Really!?" with different intonations. In summary, ADU-Bench includes over 20,000 open-ended audio dialogues for the assessment of LALMs. Through extensive experiments on 16 LALMs, our analysis reveals that existing LALMs struggle with mathematical symbols and formulas, understanding human behavior such as roleplay, comprehending multiple languages, and handling audio dialogue ambiguities from different phonetic elements, such as intonations, pause positions, and homophones. The benchmark is available at https://adu-bench.github.io/.

Abstract: Preference learning, or the task of aligning generative models to preference comparison data, has yet to reach the conceptual maturity of classification, density estimation, etc. To close this gap, this work presents a framework to understand preference learning starting from the sampling distribution of pairwise preference data. First, we prove that the only evaluation of a generative model that respects both preferences and prevalences in the data distribution is a form of win rate, justifying win rate as the focal point to understand preference learning. We then analyze preference learning methods as win rate optimization (WRO) or non-WRO. We present novel instances of WRO beyond existing examples (RLHF, NLHF) and identify two key theoretical benefits of all such methods. We prove that common non-WRO methods like DPO and SFT on preferred samples lack these properties and suggest ways to mitigate such theoretical limitations. We also show that WRO underperforms in practice due optimization difficulties and that optimization success predicts performance better than choices which affect the objective's solution. Our analysis highlights best practices for existing methods and provides recommendations for future research, guided by the principle that one should either align non-WRO methods more closely with WRO or improve the optimization of WRO objectives.

<title>Protecting Users From Themselves: Safeguarding Contextual Privacy in Interactions with Conversational Agents</title>

Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly woven into individuals' personal lives, yet users often underestimate the privacy risks associated with them. The moment users share information with these agents-such as large language models (LLMs)-their private information becomes vulnerable to exposure. In this paper, we characterize the notion of contextual privacy for user interactions with LLM-based Conversational Agents (LCAs). It aims to minimize privacy risks by ensuring that users (sender) disclose only information that is both relevant and necessary for achieving their intended goals when interacting with LCAs (untrusted receivers). Through a formative design user study, we observe how even "privacy-conscious" users inadvertently reveal sensitive information through indirect disclosures. Based on insights from this study, we propose a locally deployable framework that operates between users and LCAs, identifying and reformulating out-of-context information in user prompts. Our evaluation using examples from ShareGPT shows that lightweight models can effectively implement this framework, achieving strong gains in contextual privacy while preserving the user's intended interaction goals. Notably, about 76% of participants in our human evaluation preferred the reformulated prompts over the original ones, validating the usability and effectiveness of contextual privacy in our proposed framework. We opensource the code at https://github.com/IBM/contextual-privacy-LLM.

<title>Robust Data Watermarking in Language Models by Injecting Fictitious Knowledge</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.04036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data watermarking in language models injects traceable signals, such as specific token sequences or stylistic patterns, into copyrighted text, allowing copyright holders to track and verify training data ownership. Previous data watermarking techniques primarily focus on effective memorization during pretraining, while overlooking challenges that arise in other stages of the LLM lifecycle, such as the risk of watermark filtering during data preprocessing and verification difficulties due to API-only access. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data watermarking approach that injects plausible yet fictitious knowledge into training data using generated passages describing a fictitious entity and its associated attributes. Our watermarks are designed to be memorized by the LLM through seamlessly integrating in its training data, making them harder to detect lexically during preprocessing. We demonstrate that our watermarks can be effectively memorized by LLMs, and that increasing our watermarks' density, length, and diversity of attributes strengthens their memorization. We further show that our watermarks remain effective after continual pretraining and supervised finetuning. Finally, we show that our data watermarks can be evaluated even under API-only access via question answering.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled the creation of deceptively real images, posing significant security risks when misused. In this study, we empirically show that different timesteps of DDIM inversion reveal varying subtle distinctions between synthetic and real images that are extractable for detection, in the forms of such as Fourier power spectrum high-frequency discrepancies and inter-pixel variance distributions. Based on these observations, we propose a novel synthetic image detection method that directly utilizes features of intermediately noised images by training an ensemble on multiple noised timesteps, circumventing conventional reconstruction-based strategies. To enhance human comprehension, we introduce a metric-grounded explanation generation and refinement module to identify and explain AI-generated flaws. Additionally, we construct the GenHard and GenExplain benchmarks to provide detection samples of greater difficulty and high-quality rationales for fake images. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.91% and 95.89% detection accuracy on regular and challenging samples respectively, and demonstrates generalizability and robustness. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Shadowlized/ESIDE.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language-based communication with AI-powered chatbots. These models are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to articulate requests with minimal effort. However, despite their accessibility, studies reveal that users often struggle with effective prompting, resulting in inefficient responses. Existing research has highlighted both the limitations of LLMs in interpreting vague or poorly structured prompts and the difficulties users face in crafting precise queries. This study investigates learner-AI interactions through an educational experiment in which participants receive structured guidance on effective prompting. We introduce and compare three types of prompting guidelines: a task-specific framework developed through a structured methodology and two baseline approaches. To assess user behavior and prompting efficacy, we analyze a dataset of 642 interactions from 107 users. Using Von NeuMidas, an extended pragmatic annotation schema for LLM interaction analysis, we categorize common prompting errors and identify recurring behavioral patterns. We then evaluate the impact of different guidelines by examining changes in user behavior, adherence to prompting strategies, and the overall quality of AI-generated responses. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of how users engage with LLMs and the role of structured prompting guidance in enhancing AI-assisted communication. By comparing different instructional frameworks, we offer insights into more effective approaches for improving user competency in AI interactions, with implications for AI literacy, chatbot usability, and the design of more responsive AI systems.

Abstract: Despite increasing AI chatbot deployment in public discourse, empirical evidence on their capacity to foster intercultural empathy remains limited. Through a randomized experiment, we assessed how different AI deliberation approaches--cross-cultural deliberation (presenting other-culture perspectives), own-culture deliberation (representing participants' own culture), and non-deliberative control--affect intercultural empathy across American and Latin American participants. Cross-cultural deliberation increased intercultural empathy among American participants through positive emotional engagement, but produced no such effects for Latin American participants, who perceived AI responses as culturally inauthentic despite explicit prompting to represent their cultural perspectives. Our analysis of participant-driven feedback, where users directly flagged and explained culturally inappropriate AI responses, revealed systematic gaps in AI's representation of Latin American contexts that persist despite sophisticated prompt engineering. These findings demonstrate that current approaches to AI cultural alignment--including linguistic adaptation and explicit cultural prompting--cannot fully address deeper representational asymmetries in AI systems. Our work advances both deliberation theory and AI alignment research by revealing how the same AI system can simultaneously promote intercultural understanding for one cultural group while failing for another, with critical implications for designing equitable AI systems for cross-cultural democratic discourse.

Abstract: Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback e.g. "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own" into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second, we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for web navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

Abstract: Tibetan is a low-resource language with minimal parallel speech corpora spanning its three major dialects-\"U-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham-limiting progress in speech modeling. To address this issue, we propose FMSD-TTS, a few-shot, multi-speaker, multi-dialect text-to-speech framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from limited reference audio and explicit dialect labels. Our method features a novel speaker-dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects while preserving speaker identity. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that FMSD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in both dialectal expressiveness and speaker similarity. We further validate the quality and utility of the synthesized speech through a challenging speech-to-speech dialect conversion task. Our contributions include: (1) a novel few-shot TTS system tailored for Tibetan multi-dialect speech synthesis, (2) the public release of a large-scale synthetic Tibetan speech corpus generated by FMSD-TTS, and (3) an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized assessment of speaker similarity, dialect consistency, and audio quality.

Abstract: The automatic analysis of document layouts in digital-born PDF documents remains a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous arrangement of textual and nontextual elements and the imprecision of the textual metadata in the Portable Document Format. In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures: a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy, outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957 (near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in outcomes.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful solution for dealing with complex problems across diverse domains. The effectiveness of MAS is critically dependent on its collaboration topology, which has become a focal point for automated design research. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on a template graph modification paradigm with a predefined set of agents and hard-coded interaction structures, significantly limiting their adaptability to task-specific requirements. To address these limitations, we reframe MAS design as a conditional autoregressive graph generation task, where both the system composition and structure are designed jointly. We propose ARG-Designer, a novel autoregressive model that operationalizes this paradigm by constructing the collaboration graph from scratch. Conditioned on a natural language task query, ARG-Designer sequentially and dynamically determines the required number of agents, selects their appropriate roles from an extensible pool, and establishes the optimal communication links between them. This generative approach creates a customized topology in a flexible and extensible manner, precisely tailored to the unique demands of different tasks. Extensive experiments across six diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ARG-Designer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also enjoys significantly greater token efficiency and enhanced extensibility. The source code of ARG-Designer is available at https://github.com/Shiy-Li/ARG-Designer.

Summary: <br />
Recent advancements in natural language processing have been fueled by pretrained language models such as BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. However, these models struggle with understanding biomedical literature due to its domain-specific terminology. To address this, the MedicalBERT model was introduced, trained on a large biomedical dataset with domain-specific vocabulary to improve comprehension. MedicalBERT outperforms other BERT-based models like BioBERT, SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT across various tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, question answering, sentence similarity, and document classification. Performance metrics show that MedicalBERT exceeds the general-purpose BERT model by an average of 5.67% on all evaluated tasks. This study highlights the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medical NLP tasks and demonstrates the power of transfer learning techniques in capturing domain-specific information. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5, despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on average across all the tasks evaluated respectively.

<div> Keywords: Language models, Specification Self-Correction (SSC), test-time framework, dynamic repair, model behavior.<br />
Summary: Language models can exploit flaws in specifications to achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's intent. The Specification Self-Correction (SSC) framework allows models to identify and correct flaws in their guiding specifications. Through a multi-step inference process, the model generates a response based on the specification, critiques its output, revises the specification to remove loopholes, and generates a final response. Experiments across creative writing and coding tasks show that SSC reduces the vulnerability to gaming specifications by over 90%. This repair process occurs at inference time without weight modification, leading to more aligned model behavior.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output, and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at https://github.com/vicgalle/specification-self-correction .

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family of models, specifically designed for Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. These models are pre-trained on language-specific corpora to capture unique script features and patterns. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa outperforms general-purpose models like mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa. An ablation study confirms the importance of script-focused pre-training for improved performance. Error analysis demonstrates how shared script traits and domain-specific content impact model accuracy. The results emphasize the significance of script-aware specialization for Arabic script languages and suggest the need for further research on language-specific pre-training strategies. <br />

Abstract: In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family: four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language specificity.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian, French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved ninth place with a score of 0.612.

Summary:<br />
The paper discusses the challenges of code-mixing in natural language processing and the limitations of existing benchmarks. It evaluates the performance of large language models on code-mixed data involving 18 languages from seven language families. The study also introduces a novel method for generating synthetic code-mixed texts using word substitution and GPT-4 prompting. The analysis shows that current LLMs underperform on code-mixed datasets across multiple language families, suggesting that improvements in training data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting. Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.

<div> Keywords: STEM, Global South, speech translation, multilingual glossary, CueBuddy

Summary: 
CueBuddy addresses the issue of students in STEM classes, especially in the Global South, struggling with English technical terms despite having scientific prerequisites. The system provides real-time "lexical cues" by spotting key technical keywords and looking them up in a multilingual glossary during live lectures. This helps students stay on track with complex English jargon without interrupting their focus on the lecture. Unlike traditional speech translation models, CueBuddy is cost-effective and focuses on technical content. The system aims to bridge the gap for students who have had their course prerequisites in lower resource languages, allowing them to follow lectures more effectively. However, there are limitations to the current approach, and future extensions will need to address these challenges to make CueBuddy more efficient and user-friendly for a wider audience.

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South, fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages, and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize, and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions. Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+ introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance, flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

<div> Keywords: NLP, human-labeled data, annotator disagreements, Bayesian model, systematic disagreements

Summary: 
NLP models rely on human-labeled data, often sourced from crowdsourcing platforms with varied annotator skills. Traditional aggregation methods for conflicting annotations assume disagreements are errors. However, recent research suggests that annotator disagreements can contain valuable signal. The NUTMEG Bayesian model introduced in this work leverages annotator backgrounds to filter out noisy annotations while preserving systematic disagreements. Synthetic data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NUTMEG in recovering ground-truth from systematically disagreed annotations compared to traditional methods. The model's performance is influenced by factors such as subpopulation sizes, disagreement rates, and spam rates. Downstream models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data exhibit superior performance. This study underscores the significance of considering annotator competence and systematic disagreements when utilizing human-labeled data for training NLP models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NLP models often rely on human-labeled data for training and evaluation. Many approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations. These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic disagreements when training on human-labeled data.

Summary:
The study focuses on automating the reproducibility assessment of social science papers using AI agents, aiming to address the challenges of manual assessment. Existing benchmarks for reproducing research papers lack diversity and do not consider real-world scenarios adequately. To overcome these limitations, the researchers introduce REPRO-Bench, a collection of task instances representing social science papers with publicly available reproduction reports. AI agents are evaluated on their ability to assess reproducibility based on the original paper PDF and reproduction package. The study evaluates three AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent achieving an accuracy of 21.4%. A new agent, REPRO-Agent, improves the accuracy by 71%. The findings suggest the need for more advanced AI agents to automate real-world reproducibility assessments. REPRO-Bench is made publicly available for future research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2) oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/REPRO-Bench.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Automatic Dictionary Selection, Translation, Token Usage, Frequency Estimation

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces the concept of Automatic Dictionary Selection (ADS) to improve translation for a wide range of languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed method, Select Low-frequency Words (SLoW), strategically selects dictionaries based on lower frequency words without needing access to training data. Experimental results show that SLoW outperforms strong baselines in translation performance while also saving token usage. Surprisingly, the method does not require actual training data for frequency estimation, making it accessible and effective for enhancing translation with models like ChatGPT and Llama. Overall, ADS with SLoW shows promising results in improving translation efficiency and performance across a diverse set of languages.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary \textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency \textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods, where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100 languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}

In total, 888 chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health, and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots. The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2 percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13 percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these powerful tools.

<div> Keywords: vision-language models, creative captions, image-text retrieval, dataset, abstraction

Summary:
In this study, a novel method is introduced for mining contextualized associations for salient visual elements in images, allowing for the generation of creative captions at varying levels of abstraction. By leveraging this method, the researchers produced a dataset of visual associations and 1.7 million creative captions for images in the MSCOCO dataset. Human evaluation confirmed that these captions maintained visual grounding while exhibiting increasing levels of abstraction. Additionally, fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset led to significant improvements in zero-shot image-text retrieval in creative domains such as poetry and metaphor visualization. The dataset, generation code, and models developed in this work are made available for the wider research community to utilize. <div>

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text. In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset. Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover, fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for use by the broader community.

<div> Keywords: multilingual language models, activation patterns, sparse autoencoders, low-rank adaptation, performance improvement

Summary:<br />
- Multilingual large language models show strong cross-linguistic generalization but struggle with medium to low resource languages on benchmarks.
- Activation patterns in Gemma-2-2B across multiple languages reveal disparities, with medium to low resource languages experiencing lower activations in both early and deep layers.
- Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze and address these activation disparities.
- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is applied for activation-aware fine-tuning, leading to significant activation gains for medium to low resource languages while maintaining English retention.
- After fine-tuning, benchmark results show consistent improvements, underscoring activation alignment as a crucial factor in enhancing performance of multilingual LLMs.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese (zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam (ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns. Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

<br />
Summary:
<br />
The article introduces LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel framework for multimodal multilingual translation that addresses challenges like cross-lingual interference. It explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations, utilizing a layer selection mechanism to identify informative layers for different language pairs. Additionally, a neuron-level adaptation strategy dynamically selects language-specific and agnostic neurons to enhance translation quality and reduce redundancy. Through experiments on M3-Multi30K and M3-AmbigCaps datasets, LLaVA-NeuMT outperforms full fine-tuning approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results while fine-tuning only 40% of the model parameters. The analysis provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution for cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enhances translation quality by incorporating visual context, helping to resolve textual ambiguities. While existing MMT methods perform well in bilingual settings, extending them to multilingual translation remains challenging due to cross-lingual interference and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies. To address this, we propose LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and M3-AmbigCaps datasets, demonstrating that LLaVA-NeuMT, while fine-tuning only 40\% of the model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning approaches and ultimately achieves SOTA results on both datasets. Our analysis further provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution to cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

<div> Keyword: conversation dynamics, similarity measure, validation framework, conversational agents, online community<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new similarity measure for comparing conversations based on their interactional dynamics. By analyzing how replies combine to give a conversation its overall shape, this metric provides a holistic view of conversational quality. The study includes a validation framework to test the measure's robustness and sensitivity to different conversation topics. The goal is to enhance the analysis of conversational data and evaluate conversational agents more effectively. Applying the measure to a large online community, the researchers uncover insights into the role of situational power in conversations. This research fills a gap in automated methods for evaluating and comparing conversations, offering a valuable tool for studying interactional patterns. <div>
arXiv:2507.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally, to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of situational power in conversations.

<div> Keywords: large language models, mathematical reasoning, Multi-TAG, aggregation-based framework, inference-only

Summary: 
Multi-TAG is a novel framework for enhancing mathematical reasoning systems by aggregating the outputs of multiple external tools concurrently invoked by a large language model. Unlike previous approaches, Multi-TAG does not require finetuning and can be applied to any LLM backbone. By leveraging multiple tools simultaneously, Multi-TAG significantly improves solution robustness and accuracy on complex math problems across challenging benchmarks like MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. The framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0% to 7.5%. Multi-TAG's inference-only nature makes it suitable for computationally expensive open-weight models and proprietary models that cannot be finetuned with custom recipes. Overall, Multi-TAG represents a promising advancement in the development of high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks: MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0% to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

<div> Keywords: Argument Summarization, Large Language Diffusion Framework, Sufficiency-Guided Remasking, Generation Strategy, Evaluation Metrics

Summary: 
Arg-LLaDA introduces a novel approach to argument summarization by iteratively improving summaries through sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration. This large language diffusion framework combines a masking controller with a sufficiency-checking module to enhance the fidelity, conciseness, and coherence of generated summaries. Empirical results on benchmark datasets show that Arg-LLaDA outperforms existing methods in automatic evaluation metrics and is validated through human evaluations. The iterative generation strategy leads to significant improvements in core dimensions such as coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach in capturing complex, multi-perspective debates with structured representations. <div>
arXiv:2507.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported, redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

Summary:
The article introduces DebateCV, a novel claim verification framework that utilizes a debate-driven approach with multiple LLM agents to tackle complex claim verification tasks. Two Debaters present contrasting viewpoints on a claim, engaging in multi-round argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and delivers a verdict. A post-training strategy leveraging synthetic debate data enhances the Moderator's performance by addressing the lack of real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DebateCV over existing methods across varying levels of evidence quality. The framework's code and dataset are openly accessible for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework, two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DebateCV-6781.

Summary: <br />
The study focuses on the importance of topic interpretation for downstream applications and the limitations of existing evaluation measures such as coherence and word intrusion. To address this gap, user studies were conducted to understand how users interpret topics and assess constructs of topic quality. The analysis revealed that users rely on availability and representativeness heuristics rather than probability when interpreting topics. A theory of topic interpretation based on the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic was proposed, suggesting that users anchor on salient words and make semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. The study emphasizes the need for cognitive biases-aware user models and evaluation frameworks to better understand topic interpretation as a judgment made under uncertainty by ecologically rational users. <div>

Abstract: Interpretation of topics is crucial for their downstream applications. State-of-the-art evaluation measures of topic quality such as coherence and word intrusion do not measure how much a topic facilitates the exploration of a corpus. To design evaluation measures grounded on a task, and a population of users, we do user studies to understand how users interpret topics. We propose constructs of topic quality and ask users to assess them in the context of a topic and provide rationale behind evaluations. We use reflexive thematic analysis to identify themes of topic interpretations from rationales. Users interpret topics based on availability and representativeness heuristics rather than probability. We propose a theory of topic interpretation based on the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: users anchor on salient words and make semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. Topic interpretation can be viewed as making a judgment under uncertainty by an ecologically rational user, and hence cognitive biases aware user models and evaluation frameworks are needed.

Summary: 
This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute to biased outputs, specifically focusing on gender and professional bias. Using Italian language to highlight potential limitations in LLMs, the study examines responses to ungendered prompts related to different professional job combinations. Two popular LLM-based chatbots, OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Gemini, were analyzed, revealing how they perpetuate stereotypes in generated content. For example, gender pronouns were consistently associated with specific job roles, reinforcing societal biases. The presence of bias in AI-generated text raises ethical concerns, particularly in fields like workplaces and job selections. Understanding these risks is crucial to developing mitigation strategies and ensuring that AI systems promote equitable outcomes. Future research directions include expanding the study to more chatbots or languages, refining prompt engineering methods, and increasing experimental data.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600 responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she' pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use. Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

arXiv:2507.19195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models (LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE) versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models, we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE. Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

Summary:
ArxivRoll proposes a dynamic evaluation framework to address the issue of overestimation in large language models (LLMs). It consists of two components: SCP for generating private test cases and Rugged Scores for measuring contamination and bias. The framework constructs a new benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and evaluates LLM performance. The approach aims to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and efficiency in evaluating LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the quality of the benchmark and provide a systematic evaluation of current LLMs. The source code is available for access, enabling researchers to utilize ArxivRoll for fair and unbiased evaluations of LLMs. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments. Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography. ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii) Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of current LLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/liangzid/ArxivRoll/.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the vulnerability of Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) to jailbreak attacks and highlights safety vulnerabilities in their architecture. Existing jailbreak methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) are ineffective against LLDMs, raising concerns about harmful generation capabilities. The authors introduce a PArallel Decoding jailbreak (PAD) technique for LLDMs, achieving a high success rate in attack scenarios. Experimental evaluations show that LLDMs increase harmful generation speed by 2x compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size. This study provides critical insights into LLDM architecture and emphasizes the need for secure deployment strategies to mitigate risks of uncontrolled misuse.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs. Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size, LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure deployment of diffusion-based language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of instruction-following tasks, yet their grasp of nuanced social science concepts remains underexplored. This paper examines whether LLMs can identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned. Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on out-of-domain data.

<div> Keywords: Phenotype concept recognition, biomedical text mining, AutoPCR, entity extraction, large language model <br />
Summary: <br />
Phenotype concept recognition (CR) in biomedical text mining is crucial for various applications like clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph construction. Current methods often struggle with generalization and require ontology-specific training. The AutoPCR approach presented in this study eliminates the need for ontology-specific training and excels in phenotype CR through a three-stage process. It combines rule-based and neural tagging strategies for entity extraction, utilizes SapBERT for candidate retrieval, and links entities through prompting a large language model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets showcase AutoPCR's superior performance in both mention-level and document-level evaluations compared to existing methods. Ablation and transfer studies confirm its inductive capability and generalizability to new ontologies, establishing AutoPCR as a state-of-the-art approach in phenotype CR. <br />

Abstract: Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

<div> Keywords: Recurrent LLMs, Self-Attention LLMs, Smooth Reading, long-context tasks, efficiency

Summary:
Recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear computational complexity are gaining popularity as efficient alternatives to Self-Attention LLMs for long-context tasks. However, they often struggle due to limited memory capacity. To address this issue, the paper introduces Smooth Reading, a chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. This approach processes context in chunks and summarizes information iteratively, reducing memory demands and improving compatibility with Recurrent LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that Smooth Reading narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks, boosting Recurrent LLMs' performance while maintaining efficiency advantages. This method allows Recurrent LLMs to achieve comparable performance with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks, showcasing its potential for future research in this area. The code and dataset will be released to facilitate further progress. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from 5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench. Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further progress, we will release code and dataset.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy. Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy, outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation for robust multimodal emotion analysis.

Summary:
Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) is introduced as a new evaluation pipeline for assessing voice understanding abilities of large language models (LLM) Voice. SIQ goes beyond traditional metrics like word error rate to evaluate LLM Voice across three cognitive levels based on Bloom's Taxonomy. It looks at verbatim accuracy, interpretations similarity, and QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks. SIQ allows for unified comparisons between cascaded methods and end-to-end models, uncovers annotation errors in benchmarks, and identifies hallucinations in LLM Voice. This framework integrates cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, highlighting challenges in multi-modal training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training.

<div> Keywords: Spoken GEC, automated method, augmented dataset, objective metrics, S&amp;I Corpus

Summary:
An automated method for generating audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies is proposed to address the lack of high-quality annotated datasets for Spoken Grammatical Error Correction (SGEC). Objective metrics are suggested to evaluate the generated data and select the most suitable dataset for SGEC. The aim is to create an augmented dataset that preserves the original data's textual and acoustic characteristics while introducing new types of errors. The augmented corpus should enhance the original corpus without impacting the language assessment scores of second language (L2) learners. The evaluation of the augmented dataset covers written GEC and SGEC using the S&amp;I Corpus, the first publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations. <div>

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction (GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&amp;I Corpus, the first publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

Summary:<br />
The study sets a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in Dutch clinical free text using various transformer models. They trained a Bi-LSTM model and four transformer-based models for named entity recognition and relation classification using annotated Dutch ICU progress notes. The models were evaluated internally and externally for ADE detection, with MedRoBERTa.nl performing the best with an F1 score of 0.63. The external validation showed MedRoBERTa.nl achieving a recall of 67 to 74% in detecting ADEs in discharge letters. The study emphasizes the importance of using appropriate performance measures for ADE detection in clinical documents and provides a robust evaluation approach for language models in this task. Future clinical applications can benefit from the findings of this benchmark study. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using 102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities (end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and 0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and envisioned future clinical use.

Summary: 
- Medical text embedding models are crucial for healthcare applications but often lack diversification in training data and up-to-date methodology.
- The authors propose using MEDTE, a GTE model fine-tuned on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning, to improve medical text embeddings.
- A benchmark suite of 51 tasks tailored to medical text is introduced to evaluate the performance of the embeddings.
- Results show that the combined approach of MEDTE and the benchmark suite outperforms existing models in various medical tasks.
- This work addresses critical shortcomings in current medical text embedding models and provides a robust evaluation framework for assessing their performance. <div>
arXiv:2507.19407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

Summary: Large language models (LLMs) are often adapted to tasks using reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, using natural language reflection can provide a richer learning experience for LLMs compared to sparse rewards. A new prompt optimizer, GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), incorporates natural language reflection to learn high-level rules through trial and error. By analyzing system-level trajectories and proposing prompt updates in natural language, GEPA can achieve significant quality gains with fewer rollouts. In experiments across four tasks, GEPA outperformed GRPO by 10% on average and up to 20%, while using significantly fewer rollouts. It also outperformed MIPROv2, a leading prompt optimizer, by over 10% on two LLMs and showed promise as an inference-time search strategy for code optimization. <br /><br />Summary: Large language models can benefit from using natural language reflection for learning tasks, as demonstrated by the success of the GEPA prompt optimizer. By incorporating natural language feedback into the learning process, GEPA outperformed traditional reinforcement learning methods like GRPO and other prompt optimizers like MIPROv2. Using a system-level approach and leveraging the interpretable nature of language, GEPA achieved higher quality gains with fewer rollouts, showcasing the potential of language-driven learning strategies for large language models. <div>
arXiv:2507.19457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse, scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer, MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

<div> Keywords: large language models, cooperation, Prisoner's Dilemma game, communication, business settings

Summary: 
Participants in two experiments played the Prisoner's Dilemma game against humans, classic bots, and a large language model (LLM). Cooperation rates with LLMs were slightly lower than with humans but still high, suggesting LLMs can be used in cooperative business settings. Allowing communication increased cooperation rates with both humans and LLMs by 88%, surprising given the assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines. Cooperation with LLMs was higher after prior interaction with humans, indicating a spillover effect in cooperative behavior. These findings highlight the potential for LLMs to augment humans in cooperative tasks, offering valuable insights for businesses looking to leverage LLM technology.

Abstract: Machines driven by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment humans across various tasks, a development with profound implications for business settings where effective communication, collaboration, and stakeholder trust are paramount. To explore how interacting with an LLM instead of a human might shift cooperative behavior in such settings, we used the Prisoner's Dilemma game -- a surrogate of several real-world managerial and economic scenarios. In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round repeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time). In Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or an LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling LLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation rates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points compared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This finding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost of selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about cooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the likelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is particularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines compared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher following prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in cooperative behavior. Our findings validate the (careful) use of LLMs by businesses in settings that have a cooperative component.

Abstract: Efficiently navigating and understanding academic papers is crucial for scientific progress. Traditional linear formats like PDF and HTML can cause cognitive overload and obscure a paper's hierarchical structure, making it difficult to locate key information. While LLM-based chatbots offer summarization, they often lack nuanced understanding of specific sections, may produce unreliable information, and typically discard the document's navigational structure. Drawing insights from a formative study on academic reading practices, we introduce TreeReader, a novel language model-augmented paper reader. TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure where each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise summary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users to quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and verify summaries against the source text. A user study was conducted to evaluate TreeReader's impact on reading efficiency and comprehension. TreeReader provides a more focused and efficient way to navigate and understand complex academic literature by bridging hierarchical summarization with interactive exploration.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new possibilities for unified modeling of speech, text, images, and other modalities. Building on our prior work, this paper examines the conditions and model architectures under which multiple input modalities can improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy in noisy environments. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we find that (1) harnessing more modalities usually improves ASR accuracy, as each modality provides complementary information, but the improvement depends on the amount of auditory noise. (2) Synchronized modalities (e.g., lip movements) are more useful at high noise levels whereas unsynchronized modalities (e.g., image context) are most helpful at moderate noise levels. (3) Higher-quality visual representations consistently improve ASR accuracy, highlighting the importance of developing more powerful visual encoders. (4) Mamba exhibits similar trends regarding the benefits of multimodality as do Transformers. (5) The input order of modalities as well as their weights in the loss function can significantly impact accuracy. These findings both offer practical insights and help to deepen our understanding of multi-modal speech recognition under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems (FDSDS) enable more natural human-machine interactions by allowing real-time user interruptions and backchanneling, compared to traditional SDS that rely on turn-taking. However, existing benchmarks lack metrics for FD scenes, e.g., evaluating model performance during user interruptions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive FD benchmarking pipeline utilizing LLMs, TTS, and ASR to address this gap. It assesses FDSDS's ability to handle user interruptions, manage delays, and maintain robustness in challenging scenarios with diverse novel metrics. We applied our benchmark to three open-source FDSDS (Moshi, Freeze-omni, and VITA-1.5) using over 40 hours of generated speech, with 293 simulated conversations and 1,200 interruptions. The results show that all models continue to face challenges, such as failing to respond to user interruptions, under frequent disruptions and noisy conditions. Demonstrations, data, and code will be released.

Summary: 
GR-CLIP is proposed as a post-hoc calibration method to address the modality gap issue in the embedding space of CLIP for mixed modality search tasks. Analysis shows that current models exhibit a modality gap leading to ranking bias and fusion failure. GR-CLIP significantly improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points over CLIP on the MixBench benchmark. It outperforms vision-language generative embedding models by 4 percentage points with significantly lower computational requirements, demonstrating its efficiency. This work highlights the importance of addressing modality gaps in mixed modality search scenarios and provides a practical solution with GR-CLIP. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4 percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

Summary:
PurpCode introduces a novel approach for training safe code reasoning models, focusing on generating secure code and preventing malicious cyber activities. The training process involves two stages: Rule Learning teaches the model to follow cybersafety rules, while Reinforcement Learning optimizes model safety and utility through various reward mechanisms. The model, PurpCode-32B, achieves superior cybersafety performance compared to existing models. An alignment method reduces model overrefusal rates and maintains utility in code generation and security knowledge tasks. The training pipeline is enriched with extensive cybersafety data synthesized through internal red-teaming to create realistic unsafe prompts for the model. Overall, PurpCode ensures that the reasoning-based coding model not only generates vulnerability-free code but also actively defends against potential cyber threats, making it a significant advancement in the field of secure code reasoning models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms. To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

<div> Keywords: retrieval-augmented generation, utility-based selection, large language models, distillation, answer quality

Summary: 
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating retrieved information with a focus on utility rather than just relevance. The high computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of passages evaluated, especially for complex queries. To address this, a method to distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient models is proposed. This approach enables dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without fixed thresholds. Student models are trained to learn pseudo-answer generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer quality. Utility-based selection is found to be more effective than relevance ranking in enhancing answer generation performance for complex questions. Annotations for relevance ranking and utility-based selection on the MS MARCO dataset will be released to support further research in this area. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking, enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting further research in this area.

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15 applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code, environments, baselines, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/OS-Copilot/OS-Map.

Summary: 
Large language models have enabled social robots to engage in open-domain conversations, but they lack the ability to utilize multiple modalities for social interactions. The need for a multimodal system in social conversations with robots is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of incorporating visual information. Vision-language models are proposed as a solution to process various visual cues in a general manner for autonomous social robots. Adapting these models to the social conversation setting poses technical challenges that need to be addressed. Evaluation practices for such systems must also be considered to assess their effectiveness in social interactions. Overall, integrating vision-language models into social robots can enhance their ability to engage in meaningful and natural conversations by incorporating visual context into their understanding and responses.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models have given social robots the ability to autonomously engage in open-domain conversations. However, they are still missing a fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry social interactions. While previous work has focused on task-oriented interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual information in a sufficiently general manner for autonomous social robots. We describe how to adapt them to this setting, which technical challenges remain, and briefly discuss evaluation practices.

Summary: 
The study explores the segmentation of speech into word-like units and the clustering of these segments to create a lexicon. Existing methods fall into two frameworks: bottom-up and top-down. The research compares a simple bottom-up strategy with a top-down system, finding that both achieve state-of-the-art results on the ZeroSpeech benchmarks. The bottom-up approach is significantly faster, while the top-down approach can be beneficial in certain cases. However, both methods are limited by the clustering step, suggesting a need for improved techniques in this area. The study recommends focusing on developing more advanced clustering techniques and enhancing the discriminative power of word-like representations. Through detailed analyses, the research sheds light on the effectiveness of top-down information in segmentation tasks, highlighting the importance of considering factors such as candidate boundaries in achieving optimal results. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like units and clustering these to create a lexicon. Prior work can be categorized into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection. However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor. Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations.

Summary: 
This article introduces a new analytical framework for auto-regressive language models using Markov Categories (MCs). By deconstructing the generation process and the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective, the framework provides insight into the success of speculative decoding methods like EAGLE by quantifying information surplus in hidden states. It also formalizes how NLL minimization helps the model learn not just the next token but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity through categorical entropy analysis. Moreover, the study demonstrates that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive learning, aligning the learned representation space with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator. This perspective sheds light on the underlying structural principles that make modern language models effective. <div>

Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences, allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE, quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head, we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page: https://github.com/asiresearch/lm-theory

<div> Keywords: retrieval-augmented generation, large language models, noisy passages, Passage Injection, robustness <br />
Summary: <br />
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is commonly used to enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, but noisy retrieved passages can reduce its effectiveness. To address this issue, Passage Injection is proposed, which integrates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process to improve their ability to identify and resist noisy passages. Experimental results using BM25 as the retriever and four reasoning-enhanced LLMs on factual QA datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly enhances RAG performance. The method is also effective in handling noisy retrieval settings and leveraging helpful passages. This study suggests that incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising approach for developing more robust RAG systems. The code for Passage Injection is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e., low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise, where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise, where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for building more robust RAG systems.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning, shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments, and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks (\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks. Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection depends on user priorities.

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity, knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks, utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology, aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA) metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios. Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore, to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important, task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization, effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation data, and running environment will be publicly available at https://github.com/open-compass/MMBench-GUI.

Abstract: End-to-end relation extraction (E2ERE) is an important and realistic application of natural language processing (NLP) in biomedicine. In this paper, we aim to compare three prevailing paradigms for E2ERE using a complex dataset focused on rare diseases involving discontinuous and nested entities. We use the RareDis information extraction dataset to evaluate three competing approaches (for E2ERE): NER $\rightarrow$ RE pipelines, joint sequence to sequence models, and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models. We use comparable state-of-the-art models and best practices for each of these approaches and conduct error analyses to assess their failure modes. Our findings reveal that pipeline models are still the best, while sequence-to-sequence models are not far behind; GPT models with eight times as many parameters are worse than even sequence-to-sequence models and lose to pipeline models by over 10 F1 points. Partial matches and discontinuous entities caused many NER errors contributing to lower overall E2E performances. We also verify these findings on a second E2ERE dataset for chemical-protein interactions. Although generative LM-based methods are more suitable for zero-shot settings, when training data is available, our results show that it is better to work with more conventional models trained and tailored for E2ERE. More innovative methods are needed to marry the best of the both worlds from smaller encoder-decoder pipeline models and the larger GPT models to improve E2ERE. As of now, we see that well designed pipeline models offer substantial performance gains at a lower cost and carbon footprint for E2ERE. Our contribution is also the first to conduct E2ERE for the RareDis dataset.

Abstract: Loss spikes often occur during pre-training of large language models. The spikes degrade the performance of large language models and sometimes ruin the pre-training. Since the pre-training needs a vast computational budget, we should avoid such spikes. Based on the assumption that the loss spike is caused by the sudden growth of the gradient norm, we explore factors to keep the gradient norm small through an analysis of the spectral norms of the Jacobian matrices for the sub-layers. Our findings suggest that stabilizing the pre-training process requires two conditions: small sub-layers and large shortcut. We conduct various experiments to empirically verify our theoretical analyses. Experimental results demonstrate that methods satisfying the conditions effectively prevent loss spikes during pre-training.

<title>How Important is Domain Specificity in Language Models and Instruction Finetuning for Biomedical Relation Extraction?</title>

Abstract: Cutting edge techniques developed in the general NLP domain are often subsequently applied to the high-value, data-rich biomedical domain. The past few years have seen generative language models (LMs), instruction finetuning, and few-shot learning become foci of NLP research. As such, generative LMs pretrained on biomedical corpora have proliferated and biomedical instruction finetuning has been attempted as well, all with the hope that domain specificity improves performance on downstream tasks. Given the nontrivial effort in training such models, we investigate what, if any, benefits they have in the key biomedical NLP task of relation extraction. Specifically, we address two questions: (1) Do LMs trained on biomedical corpora outperform those trained on general domain corpora? (2) Do models instruction finetuned on biomedical datasets outperform those finetuned on assorted datasets or those simply pretrained? We tackle these questions using existing LMs, testing across four datasets. In a surprising result, general-domain models typically outperformed biomedical-domain models. However, biomedical instruction finetuning improved performance to a similar degree as general instruction finetuning, despite having orders of magnitude fewer instructions. Our findings suggest it may be more fruitful to focus research effort on larger-scale biomedical instruction finetuning of general LMs over building domain-specific biomedical LMs

<title>MultiSocial: Multilingual Benchmark of Machine-Generated Text Detection of Social-Media Texts</title>

Abstract: Recent LLMs are able to generate high-quality multilingual texts, indistinguishable for humans from authentic human-written ones. Research in machine-generated text detection is however mostly focused on the English language and longer texts, such as news articles, scientific papers or student essays. Social-media texts are usually much shorter and often feature informal language, grammatical errors, or distinct linguistic items (e.g., emoticons, hashtags). There is a gap in studying the ability of existing methods in detection of such texts, reflected also in the lack of existing multilingual benchmark datasets. To fill this gap we propose the first multilingual (22 languages) and multi-platform (5 social media platforms) dataset for benchmarking machine-generated text detection in the social-media domain, called MultiSocial. It contains 472,097 texts, of which about 58k are human-written and approximately the same amount is generated by each of 7 multilingual LLMs. We use this benchmark to compare existing detection methods in zero-shot as well as fine-tuned form. Our results indicate that the fine-tuned detectors have no problem to be trained on social-media texts and that the platform selection for training matters.

Abstract: Vision language models can now generate long-form answers to questions about images - long-form visual question answers (LFVQA). We contribute VizWiz-LF, a dataset of long-form answers to visual questions posed by blind and low vision (BLV) users. VizWiz-LF contains 4.2k long-form answers to 600 visual questions, collected from human expert describers and six VQA models. We develop and annotate functional roles of sentences of LFVQA and demonstrate that long-form answers contain information beyond the question answer such as explanations and suggestions. We further conduct automatic and human evaluations with BLV and sighted people to evaluate long-form answers. BLV people perceive both human-written and generated long-form answers to be plausible, but generated answers often hallucinate incorrect visual details, especially for unanswerable visual questions (e.g., blurry or irrelevant images). To reduce hallucinations, we evaluate the ability of VQA models to abstain from answering unanswerable questions across multiple prompting strategies.

Abstract: Understanding and designing biomolecules, such as proteins and small molecules, is central to advancing drug discovery, synthetic biology and enzyme engineering. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have revolutionized biomolecular research, achieving remarkable accuracy in biomolecular prediction and design. However, a critical gap remains between artificial intelligence's computational capabilities and researchers' intuitive goals, particularly in using natural language to bridge complex tasks with human intentions. Large language models have shown potential to interpret human intentions, yet their application to biomolecular research remains nascent due to challenges including specialized knowledge requirements, multimodal data integration, and semantic alignment between natural language and biomolecules. To address these limitations, we present InstructBioMol, a large language model designed to bridge natural language and biomolecules through a comprehensive any-to-any alignment of natural language, molecules and proteins. This model can integrate multimodal biomolecules as the input, and enable researchers to articulate design goals in natural language, providing biomolecular outputs that meet precise biological needs. Experimental results demonstrate that InstructBioMol can understand and design biomolecules following human instructions. In particular, it can generate drug molecules with a 10% improvement in binding affinity and design enzymes that achieve an enzyme-substrate pair prediction score of 70.4. This highlights its potential to transform real-world biomolecular research. The code is available at https://github.com/HICAI-ZJU/InstructBioMol.

<title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of Semantic Relation Knowledge of Pretrained Language Models and Humans</title>

Abstract: Recently, much work has concerned itself with the enigma of what exactly pretrained language models~(PLMs) learn about different aspects of language, and how they learn it. One stream of this type of research investigates the knowledge that PLMs have about semantic relations. However, many aspects of semantic relations were left unexplored. Generally, only one relation has been considered, namely hypernymy. Furthermore, previous work did not measure humans' performance on the same task as that performed by the PLMs. This means that at this point in time, there is only an incomplete view of the extent of these models' semantic relation knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework covering five relations beyond hypernymy, namely hyponymy, holonymy, meronymy, antonymy, and synonymy. We use five metrics (two newly introduced here) for recently untreated aspects of semantic relation knowledge, namely soundness, completeness, symmetry, prototypicality, and distinguishability. Using these, we can fairly compare humans and models on the same task. Our extensive experiments involve six PLMs, four masked and two causal language models. The results reveal a significant knowledge gap between humans and models for all semantic relations. In general, causal language models, despite their wide use, do not always perform significantly better than masked language models. Antonymy is the outlier relation where all models perform reasonably well.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. Recently, their effectiveness as embedding models has gained attention, marking a paradigm shift from traditional encoder-only models like ELMo and BERT to decoder-only, large-scale LLMs such as GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral. This survey provides an in-depth overview of this transition, beginning with foundational techniques before the LLM era, followed by LLM-based embedding models through two main strategies to derive embeddings from LLMs. 1) Direct prompting: We mainly discuss the prompt designs and the underlying rationale for deriving competitive embeddings. 2) Data-centric tuning: We cover extensive aspects that affect tuning an embedding model, including model architecture, training objectives, data constructions, etc. Upon the above, we also cover advanced methods for producing embeddings from longer texts, multilingual, code, cross-modal data, as well as reasoning-aware and other domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss factors affecting choices of embedding models, such as performance/efficiency comparisons, dense vs sparse embeddings, pooling strategies, and scaling law. Lastly, the survey highlights the limitations and challenges in adapting LLMs for embeddings, including cross-task embedding quality, trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, low-resource, long-context, data bias, robustness, etc. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners by synthesizing current advancements, highlighting key challenges, and offering a comprehensive framework for future work aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs as embedding models.

Abstract: The capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality content indistinguishable by humans from human-written texts raises many concerns regarding their misuse. Previous research has shown that LLMs can be effectively misused for generating disinformation news articles following predefined narratives. Their capabilities to generate personalized (in various aspects) content have also been evaluated and mostly found usable. However, a combination of personalization and disinformation abilities of LLMs has not been comprehensively studied yet. Such a dangerous combination should trigger integrated safety filters of the LLMs, if there are some. This study fills this gap by evaluating vulnerabilities of recent open and closed LLMs, and their willingness to generate personalized disinformation news articles in English. We further explore whether the LLMs can reliably meta-evaluate the personalization quality and whether the personalization affects the generated-texts detectability. Our results demonstrate the need for stronger safety-filters and disclaimers, as those are not properly functioning in most of the evaluated LLMs. Additionally, our study revealed that the personalization actually reduces the safety-filter activations; thus effectively functioning as a jailbreak. Such behavior must be urgently addressed by LLM developers and service providers.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have rapidly advanced, enabling the generation of high-quality images from text prompts across various domains. However, these models present notable safety concerns, including the risk of generating harmful, biased, or private content. Current research on assessing T2I safety remains in its early stages. While some efforts have been made to evaluate models on specific safety dimensions, many critical risks remain unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce T2ISafety, a safety benchmark that evaluates T2I models across three key domains: toxicity, fairness, and bias. We build a detailed hierarchy of 12 tasks and 44 categories based on these three domains, and meticulously collect 70K corresponding prompts. Based on this taxonomy and prompt set, we build a large-scale T2I dataset with 68K manually annotated images and train an evaluator capable of detecting critical risks that previous work has failed to identify, including risks that even ultra-large proprietary models like GPTs cannot correctly detect. We evaluate 12 prominent diffusion models on T2ISafety and reveal several concerns including persistent issues with racial fairness, a tendency to generate toxic content, and significant variation in privacy protection across the models, even with defense methods like concept erasing. Data and evaluator are released under https://github.com/adwardlee/t2i_safety.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an important step in adapting foundation models such as large language models to downstream tasks. To make this step more accessible to users with limited computational budgets, it is crucial to develop fine-tuning methods that are memory and computationally efficient. Sparse Fine-tuning (SpFT) and Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) are two frameworks that have emerged for addressing this problem and have been adopted widely in practice. In this work, we develop a new SpFT framework, based on ideas from neural network pruning. At a high level, we first identify ``important'' neurons/nodes using feature importance metrics from network pruning (specifically, we use the structural pruning method), and then perform fine-tuning by restricting to weights involving these neurons. Experiments on common language tasks show our method improves SpFT's memory efficiency by 20-50\% while matching the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods like LoRA's variants.

Abstract: This work investigates the ability of open Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict citation intent through in-context learning and fine-tuning. Unlike traditional approaches relying on domain-specific pre-trained models like SciBERT, we demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs can be adapted to this task with minimal task-specific data. We evaluate twelve model variations across five prominent open LLM families using zero-, one-, few-, and many-shot prompting. Our experimental study identifies the top-performing model and prompting parameters through extensive in-context learning experiments. We then demonstrate the significant impact of task-specific adaptation by fine-tuning this model, achieving a relative F1-score improvement of 8% on the SciCite dataset and 4.3% on the ACL-ARC dataset compared to the instruction-tuned baseline. These findings provide valuable insights for model selection and prompt engineering. Additionally, we make our end-to-end evaluation framework and models openly available for future use.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, ensuring their cultural sensitivity and inclusivity is paramount. We introduce our dataset, a year-long community-driven project covering all 22 Arab countries. The dataset includes instructions (input, response pairs) in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA), spanning 20 diverse topics. Built by a team of 44 researchers across the Arab world, all of whom are authors of this paper, our dataset offers a broad, inclusive perspective. We use our dataset to evaluate the cultural and dialectal capabilities of several frontier LLMs, revealing notable limitations. For instance, while closed-source LLMs generally exhibit strong performance, they are not without flaws, and smaller open-source models face greater challenges. Moreover, certain countries (e.g., Egypt, the UAE) appear better represented than others (e.g., Iraq, Mauritania, Yemen). Our annotation guidelines, code, and data for reproducibility are publicly available.

Abstract: Language models are strong few-shot learners and achieve good overall accuracy in text classification tasks, masking the fact that their results suffer from great class accuracy imbalance. We believe that the pursuit of overall accuracy should not come from enriching the strong classes, but from raising up the weak ones. To address the imbalance, we propose a Heaviside step function based ensemble debiasing method, which enables flexible rectifications of in-context learned class probabilities at both class and sample levels. Evaluations with Llama-2-13B on seven text classification benchmarks show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy gains with balanced class accuracies. More importantly, we perform analyses on the resulted probability correction scheme, showing that sample-level corrections are necessary to elevate weak classes. Due to effectively correcting weak classes, our method also brings significant performance gains to a larger model variant, Llama-2-70B, especially on a biomedical domain task, further demonstrating the necessity of ensemble debiasing at both levels. Our source code is available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/DCS.

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) is a standard information extraction task playing a major role in downstream applications such as knowledge discovery and question answering. Although decoder-only large language models are excelling in generative tasks, smaller encoder models are still the go to architecture for RE. In this paper, we revisit fine-tuning such smaller models using a novel dual-encoder architecture with a joint contrastive and cross-entropy loss. Unlike previous methods that employ a fixed linear layer for predicate representations, our approach uses a second encoder to compute instance-specific predicate representations by infusing them with real entity spans from corresponding input instances. We conducted experiments on two biomedical RE datasets and two general domain datasets. Our approach achieved F1 score improvements ranging from 1% to 2% over state-of-the-art methods with a simple but elegant formulation. Ablation studies justify the importance of various components built into the proposed architecture.

Abstract: The growing popularity of large language models has raised concerns regarding the potential to misuse AI-generated text (AIGT). It becomes increasingly critical to establish an excellent AIGT detection method with high generalization and robustness. However, existing methods either focus on model generalization or concentrate on robustness. The unified mechanism, to simultaneously address the challenges of generalization and robustness, is less explored. In this paper, we argue that robustness can be view as a specific form of domain shift, and empirically reveal an intrinsic mechanism for model generalization of AIGT detection task. Then, we proposed a novel AIGT detection method (DP-Net) via dynamic perturbations introduced by a reinforcement learning with elaborated reward and action. Experimentally, extensive results show that the proposed DP-Net significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art AIGT detection methods for generalization capacity in three cross-domain scenarios. Meanwhile, the DP-Net achieves best robustness under two text adversarial attacks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/CAU-ISS-Lab/AIGT-Detection-Evade-Detection/tree/main/DP-Net.

Abstract: We present Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale (RADLADS), a protocol for rapidly converting softmax attention transformers into linear attention decoder models, along with two new RWKV-variant architectures, and models converted from popular Qwen2.5 open source models in 7B, 32B, and 72B sizes. Our conversion process requires only 350-700M tokens, less than 0.005% of the token count used to train the original teacher models. Converting to our 72B linear attention model costs less than \$2,000 USD at today's prices, yet quality at inference remains close to the original transformer. These models achieve state-of-the-art downstream performance across a set of standard benchmarks for linear attention models of their size. We release all our models on HuggingFace under the Apache 2.0 license, with the exception of our 72B models which are also governed by the Qwen License Agreement.

<title>Distilling the Implicit Multi-Branch Structure in LLMs' Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning (which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving (which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime, unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Single-round consultation systems require patients to describe all symptoms upfront, leading to vague diagnosis with unclear complaints. Traditional multi-turn dialogue models, constrained by static supervised learning, lack flexibility and fail to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose \Ours{}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that \Ours{} outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance. This approach shows immense practical value by reducing misdiagnosis risks in time-pressured settings, freeing clinicians for complex cases, and pioneering a strategy to optimize medical resource allocation and alleviate workforce shortages.

<title>Toward Structured Knowledge Reasoning: Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to 17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward structured knowledge expertise.

Abstract: Verbatim transcription for automatic speaking assessment demands accurate capture of disfluencies, crucial for downstream tasks like error analysis and feedback. However, many ASR systems discard or generalize hesitations, losing important acoustic details. We fine-tune Whisper models on the Speak & Improve 2025 corpus using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), without recourse to external audio training data. We compare three annotation schemes: removing hesitations (Pure), generic tags (Rich), and acoustically precise fillers inferred by Gemini 2.0 Flash from existing audio-transcript pairs (Extra). Our challenge system achieved 6.47% WER (Pure) and 5.81% WER (Extra). Post-challenge experiments reveal that fine-tuning Whisper Large V3 Turbo with the "Extra" scheme yielded a 5.5% WER, an 11.3% relative improvement over the "Pure" scheme (6.2% WER). This demonstrates that explicit, realistic filled-pause labeling significantly enhances ASR accuracy for verbatim L2 speech transcription.

Abstract: Human language production exhibits remarkable richness and variation, reflecting diverse communication styles and intents. However, this variation is often overlooked in summarization evaluation. While having multiple reference summaries is known to improve correlation with human judgments, the impact of the reference set on reference-based metrics has not been systematically investigated. This work examines the sensitivity of widely used reference-based metrics in relation to the choice of reference sets, analyzing three diverse multi-reference summarization datasets: SummEval, GUMSum, and DUC2004. We demonstrate that many popular metrics exhibit significant instability. This instability is particularly concerning for n-gram-based metrics like ROUGE, where model rankings vary depending on the reference sets, undermining the reliability of model comparisons. We also collect human judgments on LLM outputs for genre-diverse data and examine their correlation with metrics to supplement existing findings beyond newswire summaries, finding weak-to-no correlation. Taken together, we recommend incorporating reference set variation into summarization evaluation to enhance consistency alongside correlation with human judgments, especially when evaluating LLMs.

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2) learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution, SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

Abstract: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) represent sophisticated attack patterns in the cybersecurity domain, described encyclopedically in textual knowledge bases. Identifying TTPs in cybersecurity writing, often called TTP mapping, is an important and challenging task. Conventional learning approaches often target the problem in the classical multi-class or multilabel classification setting. This setting hinders the learning ability of the model due to a large number of classes (i.e., TTPs), the inevitable skewness of the label distribution and the complex hierarchical structure of the label space. We formulate the problem in a different learning paradigm, where the assignment of a text to a TTP label is decided by the direct semantic similarity between the two, thus reducing the complexity of competing solely over the large labeling space. To that end, we propose a neural matching architecture with an effective sampling-based learn-to-compare mechanism, facilitating the learning process of the matching model despite constrained resources.

Abstract: Clinical decision support systems require models that are not only highly accurate but also equitable and sensitive to the implications of missed diagnoses. In this study, we introduce a knowledge-guided in-context learning (ICL) framework designed to enable large language models (LLMs) to effectively process structured clinical data. Our approach integrates domain-specific feature groupings, carefully balanced few-shot examples, and task-specific prompting strategies. We systematically evaluate this method across seventy distinct ICL designs by various prompt variations and two different communication styles-natural-language narrative and numeric conversational-and compare its performance to robust classical machine learning (ML) benchmarks on tasks involving heart disease and diabetes prediction.
  Our findings indicate that while traditional ML models maintain superior performance in balanced precision-recall scenarios, LLMs employing narrative prompts with integrated domain knowledge achieve higher recall and significantly reduce gender bias, effectively narrowing fairness disparities by an order of magnitude. Despite the current limitation of increased inference latency, LLMs provide notable advantages, including the capacity for zero-shot deployment and enhanced equity. This research offers the first comprehensive analysis of ICL design considerations for applying LLMs to tabular clinical tasks and highlights distillation and multimodal extensions as promising directions for future research.

<title>An Investigation of Prompt Variations for Zero-shot LLM-based Rankers</title>

arXiv:2406.14117v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic understanding of the impact of specific components and wordings used in prompts on the effectiveness of rankers based on zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs). Several zero-shot ranking methods based on LLMs have recently been proposed. Among many aspects, methods differ across (1) the ranking algorithm they implement, e.g., pointwise vs. listwise, (2) the backbone LLMs used, e.g., GPT3.5 vs. FLAN-T5, (3) the components and wording used in prompts, e.g., the use or not of role-definition (role-playing) and the actual words used to express this. It is currently unclear whether performance differences are due to the underlying ranking algorithm, or because of spurious factors such as better choice of words used in prompts. This confusion risks to undermine future research. Through our large-scale experimentation and analysis, we find that ranking algorithms do contribute to differences between methods for zero-shot LLM ranking. However, so do the LLM backbones -- but even more importantly, the choice of prompt components and wordings affect the ranking. In fact, in our experiments, we find that, at times, these latter elements have more impact on the ranker's effectiveness than the actual ranking algorithms, and that differences among ranking methods become more blurred when prompt variations are considered.

Abstract: Function calling significantly extends the application boundary of large language models, where high-quality and diverse training data is critical for unlocking this capability. However, real function-calling data is quite challenging to collect and annotate, while synthetic data generated by existing pipelines tends to lack coverage and accuracy. In this paper, we present ToolACE, an automatic agentic pipeline designed to generate accurate, complex, and diverse tool-learning data. ToolACE leverages a novel self-evolution synthesis process to curate a comprehensive API pool of 26,507 diverse APIs. Dialogs are further generated through the interplay among multiple agents, guided by a formalized thinking process. To ensure data accuracy, we implement a dual-layer verification system combining rule-based and model-based checks. We demonstrate that models trained on our synthesized data, even with only 8B parameters, achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, rivaling the latest GPT-4 models. Our model and a subset of the data are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/Team-ACE.

Abstract: Humans recognize objects after observing only a few examples, a remarkable capability enabled by their inherent language understanding of the real-world environment. Developing verbalized and interpretable representation can significantly improve model generalization in low-data settings. In this work, we propose Verbalized Representation Learning (VRL), a novel approach for automatically extracting human-interpretable features for object recognition using few-shot data. Our method uniquely captures inter-class differences and intra-class commonalities in the form of natural language by employing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify key discriminative features between different classes and shared characteristics within the same class. These verbalized features are then mapped to numeric vectors through the VLM. The resulting feature vectors can be further utilized to train and infer with downstream classifiers. Experimental results show that, at the same model scale, VRL achieves a 24% absolute improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods while using 95% less data and a smaller mode. Furthermore, compared to human-labeled attributes, the features learned by VRL exhibit a 20% absolute gain when used for downstream classification tasks. Code is available at: https://github.com/joeyy5588/VRL/tree/main.

<title>Accelerating Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic Visual-Token Exit and the Empirical Findings</title>

Abstract: The excessive use of visual tokens in existing Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often exhibits obvious redundancy and brings in prohibitively expensive computation. To gain insights into this problem, we first conduct extensive empirical studies on the attention behaviors of MLLMs, and summarize three main inference stages in MLLMs: (i) Early fusion between tokens is first accomplished quickly. (ii) Intra-modality modeling then comes to play. (iii) Multimodal reasoning} resumes and lasts until the end of inference. In particular, we reveal that visual tokens will stop contributing to reasoning when the text tokens receive enough image information, yielding obvious visual redundancy. Based on these generalized observations, we propose a simple yet effective method to improve the efficiency of MLLMs, termed dynamic visual-token exit (DyVTE). DyVTE uses lightweight hyper-networks to perceive the text token status and decide the removal of all visual tokens after a certain layer, thereby addressing the observed visual redundancy. To validate VTE, we apply it to a set of MLLMs, including LLaVA, VILA, Eagle and InternVL, and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of benchmarks. The experiment results not only show the effectiveness of our VTE in improving MLLMs' efficiency, but also yield the general modeling patterns of MLLMs, well facilitating the in-depth understanding of MLLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/DoubtedSteam/DyVTE.

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to systematically map features discovered by sparse autoencoder across consecutive layers of large language models, extending earlier work that examined inter-layer feature links. By using a data-free cosine similarity technique, we trace how specific features persist, transform, or first appear at each stage. This method yields granular flow graphs of feature evolution, enabling fine-grained interpretability and mechanistic insights into model computations. Crucially, we demonstrate how these cross-layer feature maps facilitate direct steering of model behavior by amplifying or suppressing chosen features, achieving targeted thematic control in text generation. Together, our findings highlight the utility of a causal, cross-layer interpretability framework that not only clarifies how features develop through forward passes but also provides new means for transparent manipulation of large language models.

Abstract: We propose a distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on a compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. Our findings mitigate the risks associated with large-scale distillation by enabling compute-optimal allocation for both the teacher and student to maximize student performance. We provide compute-optimal distillation recipes for two key scenarios: when a teacher already exists, and when a teacher needs training. In settings involving many students or an existing teacher, distillation outperforms supervised learning up to a compute level that scales predictably with student size. Conversely, if only one student is to be distilled and a teacher also requires training, supervised learning is generally preferable. Additionally, our large-scale study of distillation increases our understanding of the process and helps inform experimental design.

Abstract: AI Agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming the world through enormous applications. A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user needs, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding user intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks. However, to make such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale, significant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost. This position paper presents a design of the Super Agent System powered by the hybrid AI routers. Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the intent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the necessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most applications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and robots. As different language models vary in capability and cloud-based models often entail high computational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then explore the hybrid mode where the router dynamically selects between local and cloud models based on task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of an on-device super agent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality models and edge hardware, we envision that most computations can be handled locally, with cloud collaboration only as needed. Such architecture paves the way for super agents to be seamlessly integrated into everyday life in the near future.

Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers, and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and communication systems.

Summary:
The research addresses the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to jailbreak attacks, which can result in the generation of harmful or biased text. Existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly, prompting the proposal of the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack as an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs. This attack leverages two smaller models to modify the decoding probabilities of a larger safe model, increasing the misalignment rate dramatically. The study evaluates the attack on five open-source LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness with minimal computational overhead. The research highlights the need for urgent safety measures in aligning LLMs and proposes a defense strategy, although developing more robust defenses presents a challenge. The code for replicating the attack method is available for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks - resulting in harmful, unethical, or biased text generations. However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging. The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong

This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) in argument mining, specifically focusing on argument classification. Various LLMs, including GPT and Deepseek, are tested on argument datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The results show that ChatGPT-4o performs the best in argument classification benchmarks, while Deepseek-R1 excels among models with reasoning capabilities. Despite their accuracy, both models still make errors, with common errors discussed. This analysis is the first to extensively examine these datasets using LLMs and prompt algorithms, revealing weaknesses in the current prompt algorithms for argument analysis and suggesting directions for improvement. The study provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in argument mining and classification. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty.

<div> Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling, Dense reward signals, Large Language Models, Fine-grained reward criteria, Generalizability

Summary:
Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM) addresses the limitations of existing Process Reward Models (PRMs) by introducing a reward tree to capture fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise scoring and utilizes Pareto dominance estimation to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DG-PRM on various benchmarks, boosting model performance with dense rewards. The model's adaptability to out-of-distribution scenarios showcases exceptional generalizability, a crucial feature for real-world applications. Overall, DG-PRM presents a novel approach to guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex scenarios, significantly improving model performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However, existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results, overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally, static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks, significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards. Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

arXiv:2507.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions. Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy, addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality, task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates, critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system, implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question" vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts, https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the community.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel end-to-end approach for Automatic Speaking Assessment (ASA) developed for the 2025 Speak & Improve Challenge. The system utilizes a single Whisper-small encoder to process all four spoken responses and predict the final score, eliminating the need for transcription and per-part models. This architecture reduces inference time and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted Language Learning systems. The system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming the baseline while using fewer parameters. Additionally, a data sampling strategy was proposed, allowing the model to train on a subset of speakers and still achieve strong performance, particularly on imbalanced classes. The approach demonstrates improved data efficiency and performance on multi-part second-language tests. <div>

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025 Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70% of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach 0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong data efficiency.

Summary:
- Large language models (LLMs) have impacted writing integrity, leading to the development of AI detection technologies.
- This study focused on evaluating if commonly accessible AI detection tools can detect text generated by DeepSeek using adversarial attacks.
- QuillBot and Copyleaks performed well in recognizing original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, while others showed inconsistent results.
- Humanization was the most effective attack in reducing detector accuracy.
- Few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting exhibited high accuracy in classifying AI and human-written text.  <div>
arXiv:2507.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies. Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and 52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human recall 100%).

Summary:
- A Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC) metric is introduced to measure how well language models update their beliefs in accordance with Bayes' theorem.
- A dataset is created to quantify the BCC for various pre-trained language models from different model families.
- Larger and more capable language models show a higher coherence with Bayes' theorem in updating their beliefs when presented with evidence.
- The study compares BCC with model parameters, training data size, and model performance on standard benchmarks.
- The findings suggest that advanced pre-trained language models align better with Bayes' theorem, with implications for the understanding and regulation of such models.

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs" about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC. We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These results have important implications for our understanding and governance of LLMs.

Summary: <br />
NeuralDB is a framework that enhances editing efficiency in large language models (LLMs) by representing edited facts as a neural Key-Value database. This framework includes a non-linear gated retrieval module that preserves the general abilities of LLMs. Experiments on ZsRE and CounterFacts datasets showed that NeuralDB outperformed existing methods in editing efficacy, generalization, specificity, fluency, and consistency with models like GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B), and Llama-3 (8B). Furthermore, NeuralDB maintained its effectiveness even when scaled up to 100,000 facts, showing a significant improvement over previous work. This approach enables efficient and effective knowledge editing in LLMs without compromising their overall performance in various text understanding and generation tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is Locate-and-Edit (L\&amp;E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&amp;E methods as querying a Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular, our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts, effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization, specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

Summary:  
- GrAInS is a new inference-time steering approach for language-only and vision-language models.  
- It uses integrated gradients to identify influential tokens and constructs steering vectors for semantic shifts.  
- GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers based on token-level attribution signals.  
- It outperforms fine-tuning and existing steering baselines in various tasks like TruthfulQA and MMHal-Bench.  
- GrAInS improves model alignment win rates on SPA-VL while maintaining fluency and general capabilities.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights. However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors, overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision. Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514 with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs. Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the speech domain.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications. While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e., linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e., re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving reviewer privacy.

Summary:
TELEVAL is a new benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of spoken language models (SLMs) in conversational settings. It focuses on three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. The benchmark assesses both text and audio outputs in a dialogue format consistent with real-world usage. TELEVAL highlights the importance of SLMs extracting implicit cues from user speech and responding appropriately without additional instructions. Experiments show that existing SLMs still have room for improvement in natural conversational tasks. The goal of TELEVAL is to provide a user-centered evaluation framework that reflects the user experience and promotes the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance. However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models (LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress, existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

Summary: <br />
This paper evaluates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques for large language models (LLMs) and introduces a hybrid strategy combining BOFT's stability with LoRA-GA's convergence speed. The hybrid method dynamically adjusts updates based on gradient norms, leading to superior convergence efficiency and generalization across tasks. Additionally, unitary RNN (uRNN) principles are applied to transformer-based LLMs for enhanced gradient stability. Empirical results on various benchmarks show that the hybrid approach outperforms individual PEFT methods, achieving near full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up to 2.1 times in training time and 50% in memory usage. This study establishes the hybrid method as a practical and scalable solution for fine-tuning LLMs under resource constraints. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench, and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines, approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

The report introduces new 2024 English GloVe models, addressing the necessity for updated word embeddings due to language and world evolution. Documenting the exact data versions and preprocessing used, the models were trained on Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a Dolma subset. Evaluation revealed the vectors' incorporation of culturally relevant words, comparable performance on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and improved accuracy on recent NER datasets, particularly on non-Western newswire data. The models showcase enhanced linguistic relevance and performance, reflective of evolving language usage and needs in a constantly changing global landscape. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as non-Western newswire data.

<div> Keywords: end-to-end spoken language models, paralinguistic cues, speaker characteristics, GOAT-SLM, natural spoken interactions 

Summary: 

GOAT-SLM is a novel spoken language model that incorporates paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness, going beyond traditional models by incorporating non-linguistic cues in speech. The model features a dual-modality head architecture that separates linguistic analysis from acoustic realization, allowing for more expressive and adaptive speech generation. A modular, staged training strategy gradually incorporates linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic information from large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on the TELEVAL evaluation benchmark show that GOAT-SLM outperforms existing models in tasks such as handling emotion, dialectal variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This research emphasizes the importance of considering paralinguistic cues in spoken language models to develop more natural, adaptive, and socially aware AI systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion, and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness, designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks, and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Summary: <br />
This study focuses on evaluating the capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in performing multi-modal mathematical reasoning using code as an intermediate representation to manipulate images. The evaluation framework includes Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) to assess the model's ability to construct visualizations and Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) to evaluate fine-grained visual operations such as Deletion, Modification, and Annotation. The dataset used covers popular mathematical figure types, revealing that current MLLMs fall short of human performance in performing detailed visual operations.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2) Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation. To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual operations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias, potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed. These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

<div> Tokenization, Sticky Tokens, Text Embedding Models, NLP tasks, Downstream Tasks

Summary:
Sticky tokens in Transformer-based text embedding models can disrupt embedding distances and degrade performance, leading to concerns about their impact on downstream tasks. The Sticky Token Detector (STD) efficiently detects these anomalous tokens, revealing their origins in special or unused vocabulary entries and fragmented subwords. Sticky tokens do not correlate with model or vocabulary size but significantly affect clustering and retrieval tasks. Attention-layer analysis shows that sticky tokens dominate internal representations, highlighting the need for better tokenization strategies and model design to mitigate their impact. Further research is needed to address the presence of sticky tokens and improve the robustness of text embedding applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings. These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary, as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future text embedding applications.

Summary:
The study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation framework designed to measure and mitigate selection bias in large language models (LLMs). SCOPE uses a null prompt to estimate each model's position-bias distribution and redistributes answer slots to equalize the lucky-rate. It prevents near-miss guesses by not placing semantically similar distractors adjacent to the answer. SCOPE outperforms existing debiasing methods, showing stable performance improvements and clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework sets a new standard for improving the fairness and reliability of LLM evaluations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer, thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM evaluations.

Summary: 
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in telecommunication networks is a critical task that poses challenges for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems due to its complex, graph-based reasoning requirements and the lack of realistic benchmarks. RCA involves identifying the main cause of an issue or fault in the network, which is crucial for maintaining network efficiency and reliability. AI technologies are being developed to automate and optimize the RCA process, but the complex nature of network data and dependencies makes this task difficult. Realistic benchmarks are needed to evaluate the performance of AI systems in RCA tasks, but currently, there is a scarcity of such benchmarks in the telecommunication domain. Addressing these challenges will be essential for improving the efficiency and accuracy of RCA in telecommunication networks using AI technologies.

Summary: <br />
Business process modeling is essential for organizations to ensure efficiency and alignment with strategic goals. ISO30401 sets universal requirements for Knowledge Management Systems (KMS), integrating knowledge development with operational processes. Implementers face the challenge of explaining how KMS activities align with existing processes. This article explores how an ISO30401-compliant KMS can be implemented within an Integrated Management System. By deploying the SECI model and utilizing PDCA cycles, organizations can effectively integrate knowledge management into their existing processes. This approach enhances efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that knowledge development, transformation, and conveyance activities are seamlessly integrated with operational workflows. <div>

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes, sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard, introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS) entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

Summary:
The paper introduces a defense mechanism called Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP) to protect Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems from adversarial attacks. By analyzing the gradients of the similarity function used in retrieving external knowledge, GMTP identifies and masks high-impact tokens that could be part of poisoned documents. These tokens are then evaluated using a Masked Language Model to detect malicious content. The experimental results show that GMTP can effectively filter out over 90% of poisoned documents while maintaining the performance of retrieval and generation tasks on various datasets and in different adversarial scenarios. This approach enhances the security of LLMs by preventing the generation of harmful or misleading responses based on tampered external knowledge sources.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However, this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Summary:
Instruction-tuning in large language models (LLMs) improves user instruction accuracy but may lead to increased susceptibility to misinformation. LLMs tuned with instructions are more likely to accept misinformation provided by users, shifting reliance from the model to the user. Factors affecting susceptibility include user role in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the presence of warnings in prompts. The study emphasizes the need for systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning and enhance LLM reliability in real-world applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information, shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore, we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

<div> pruning, language models, acceleration, magnitude compensation, iterative strategy
Summary:<br /><br />Layer pruning in large language models (LLMs) can lead to performance degradation due to significant magnitude gaps in hidden states. The proposed Prune&amp;Comp method addresses this issue by using magnitude compensation to mitigate these gaps without the need for training. By estimating and rescaling the weights to eliminate the magnitude gaps, Prune&amp;Comp can enhance existing layer pruning metrics. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop, it improves performance metrics significantly. For instance, when applying Prune&amp;Comp to the pruning of 5 layers in LLaMA-3-8B using a block influence metric, it reduces perplexity by nearly half and retains 93.19% of the original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by 4.01%. <div>
arXiv:2507.18212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&amp;Comp, a novel plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred. We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&amp;Comp through an iterative pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop, Prune&amp;Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance, when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence metric, Prune&amp;Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by 4.01%.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges of accurately translating terminology within utterances in direct speech translation. Current methods struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and inefficient utilization of translation knowledge. To address these issues, a novel Locate-and-Focus method is proposed. This method effectively locates speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information. It associates this knowledge with the utterance and hypothesis from audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to focus better on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results show that the method successfully locates terminologies within utterances, improves terminology translation success rates, and maintains robust general translation performance. Overall, the Locate-and-Focus method enhances the translation of terminology in direct speech translation by minimizing noise interference and optimizing the utilization of translation knowledge.

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays, yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL). However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking dataset.

We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming brand-specific convention uptake.

<div> Keywords: Large reasoning models, backdoor attacks, data poisoning, chain-of-thought reasoning, artificial intelligence 

Summary:
Large reasoning models (LRMs) are advanced language models designed for complex reasoning tasks, with a focus on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. A new attack vector called "overthinking backdoors" targets LRMs by introducing a tunable backdoor that allows attackers to control the model's reasoning verbosity. This attack is implemented through data poisoning, using a trigger to increase the verbosity of the model's responses without affecting correctness. By injecting redundant refinement steps into the reasoning process, the attacker can significantly increase the length of the reasoning process. The source code for this attack method is available on GitHub. This novel approach demonstrates the potential vulnerability of LRMs to controlled attacks that manipulate the extent of reasoning without impacting the final output correctness.

<br /><br />Summary: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities are vulnerable to "overthinking backdoor" attacks using data poisoning. Attackers can manipulate the verbosity of LRMs by introducing triggers that increase the length of reasoning processes without affecting correctness. This controlled attack method highlights the potential security risks associated with LRMs in artificial intelligence research. <div>
arXiv:2507.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning process, without degrading the final answer's correctness.

<div> gender, machine translation, bias, uncertainty, debiasing

Summary: 
Machine translation models often struggle with gendered languages, especially when the source language does not explicitly mark gender. This can lead to biased translations based on stereotypes rather than context. The study suggests that models should maintain uncertainty when translating ambiguous gender instances, even if they are confident in their translation. Results show that models that are accurate in translating unambiguous instances may not exhibit the same level of uncertainty in ambiguous cases. Additionally, debiasing techniques have varying effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translations, indicating the need for further research in mitigating biases in machine translation. <div>
arXiv:2507.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

<title>TDR: Task-Decoupled Retrieval with Fine-Grained LLM Feedback for In-Context Learning</title>

<div> Keywords: In-context learning, LLMs, example retrieval, TDR framework, NLP tasks

Summary:
In the realm of in-context learning, the quality of input-output examples plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of language model handling various tasks. The TDR framework addresses two key challenges: distinguishing cross-task data distributions and establishing a fine-grained connection between retriever output and LLM feedback. TDR decouples examples from different tasks, enhancing the retrieval module's ability to select task-specific examples within a multi-task dataset. Additionally, TDR incorporates feedback from LLMs to supervise and refine the retrieval process, resulting in the retrieval of high-quality examples. Experimental results on 30 NLP tasks demonstrate that TDR consistently improves performance, achieving state-of-the-art results across all datasets. Moreover, TDR is easily integrated with different LLMs, making it a versatile and effective tool for enhancing example retrieval capabilities in in-context learning scenarios.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2) Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to improve example retrieval abilities for ICL.

<div> Keywords: propaganda detection, social media, Large Language Model, human annotation, hierarchical taxonomy

Summary: 
This paper presents a novel framework for propaganda detection on social media that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM) assistance. The framework includes a hierarchical taxonomy of 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques organized into three categories. A human annotation study on the HQP dataset reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels. An LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline extracts propagandistic spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns labels. A secondary human verification study shows improved agreement and time-efficiency. Smaller language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on LLM-generated data for structured annotation, enabling a large model to produce annotations and a smaller model to learn from them via knowledge distillation. This work aims to develop scalable and robust propaganda detection systems, promoting transparent and accountable media ecosystems in alignment with SDG 16. The code for this framework is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM) assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation. Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Summary:
CLEAR is an open-source package designed to facilitate error analysis for Large Language Models (LLMs). It aims to provide specific and actionable feedback on model performance by generating per-instance textual feedback and identifying system-level error issues. The package offers an interactive dashboard that allows users to visualize and analyze errors, apply filters to isolate specific issues, and delve into individual instances. By using CLEAR, researchers can gain insights into the reasons behind a model's performance, going beyond top-level scores or rankings. The demonstration of CLEAR analysis on RAG and Math benchmarks highlights its utility in evaluating LLMs effectively. <div>
arXiv:2507.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific, actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks, and showcase its utility through a user case study.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles, defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset. These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia content.

<div> Keywords: sentiment analysis, finance, Generative AI, Direct Preference Optimization, LLM <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Online finance-related textual data is increasingly influencing trading decisions, emphasizing the need for accurate sentiment analysis. Current methods, such as supervised fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), can struggle to generalize to new data. To address this, FinDPO, a finance-specific LLM framework, utilizes Direct Preference Optimization to align with human preferences post-training. FinDPO outperforms existing models by 11% on sentiment classification benchmarks. It also introduces a novel 'logit-to-score' conversion to integrate sentiment predictions into portfolio strategies. Simulation results show FinDPO maintains substantial annual returns of 67% and a strong Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even with realistic transaction costs. This approach marks a significant advancement in sentiment-based financial analysis. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs) have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However, the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO, the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel 'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way, simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

<div> benchmark, Arabic, tabular data, large language models, reasoning

Summary:
The article introduces AraTable, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Arabic tabular data. AraTable includes tasks such as question answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, covering a wide range of Arabic tabular sources. The dataset is curated using a hybrid pipeline involving LLMs and human experts to ensure quality. Initial results show that while LLMs perform well on basic tasks, they struggle with more complex reasoning and fact verification challenges. The research also proposes an automated evaluation framework that nearly matches human judge performance. This work aims to provide a valuable resource for developing models that can effectively process and analyze Arabic structured data. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats, remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and analysing Arabic structured data.

Summary: 
This study explores the use of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, for automatically restoring punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. The focus is on predicting four punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark in diverse text domains. To overcome the lack of annotated resources, a large and varied training corpus was constructed, along with data augmentation techniques. The best-performing model, with an augmentation factor of alpha = 0.20%, achieves high accuracies on different test sets. Strong generalization is shown to reference and ASR transcripts, indicating the model's effectiveness in noisy scenarios. This work establishes a solid baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and provides publicly available datasets and code for further research in low-resource NLP.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in low-resource NLP.

Summary: 
The paper conducts a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text, focusing on the purpose, techniques, and evaluation methods. The main purposes of generating synthetic medical text include text augmentation, assistive writing, privacy-preserving, and annotation. Transformer architectures, particularly GPTs, are commonly used for text generation. Evaluation of synthetic medical text focuses on similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, with utility being the main method used. While synthetic medical text shows potential in improving accuracy and overcoming sparsity issues, privacy remains a concern. Human assessments are necessary to ensure sensitive information is not present. Despite this, advancements in synthetic medical text generation can streamline workflows and pipeline development, reducing the legal complexities of data transfer. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i) the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing, corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text, especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of data transfer.

Summary: <br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating tabular data by representing feature-value pairs. However, tabular data often has sparse feature-level dependencies, leading to a diluted focus on critical relationships in LLMs. To address this issue, GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning) integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs' attention mechanism, prioritizing important feature interactions. Experimental results across various datasets show that GraDe outperforms existing LLM-based methods by up to 12% on complex datasets and achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality. GraDe is a non-intrusive yet effective solution for modeling structure-aware tabular data with LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2507.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs' attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality. Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Summary: 
The study focuses on the importance of detecting moral foundations in social discourse and the development of ethically-aligned AI systems. While large language models (LLMs) are effective in various tasks, their performance in specialized moral reasoning is uncertain. The research compares LLMs and fine-tuned transformers using Twitter and Reddit datasets, analyzing ROC, PR, and DET curves. Results show significant performance differences, with LLMs having high false negative rates and a tendency to miss moral content despite prompt engineering adjustments. Task-specific fine-tuning proves to be more effective for moral reasoning applications compared to simple prompting. This comparison sheds light on the need for tailored approaches in ethical AI development.

By employing a Graph Attention Network adapter, GIIFT learns multimodal knowledge in a unified fused space and generalizes it to image-free translation domains. Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset for English-to-French and English-to-German tasks show that GIIFT outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance without images during inference.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains. Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards inductive image-free inference.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of 10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling. This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion Large Language Models, Parallel generation, Wide-In, Narrow-Out, WINO 

Summary: 
WINO is a training-free decoding algorithm designed to improve the quality-speed trade-off in Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs). This algorithm enables revokable decoding by using a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, drafting multiple tokens simultaneously while verifying and refining suspicious ones using bidirectional context. Through experiments on open-source DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO was shown to significantly accelerate inference speed while improving accuracy. For example, on the GSM8K math benchmark, WINO achieved a 6$\times$ speedup with a 2.58% accuracy improvement, and on the Flickr30K captioning task, it achieved a 10$\times$ speedup with enhanced performance. The results demonstrate the superiority of WINO in resolving the quality-speed trade-off in DLLMs, making it a promising solution for fast parallel generation with improved accuracy. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.18578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation. However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO), a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs. WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance. More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

<div> Keywords: large language models, specialized domains, data synthesis, logic, inspection

Summary: <br /><br />
The article introduces AQuilt, a framework designed to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains. Existing approaches to address this issue often come with high computational costs or limited performance gains. AQuilt aims to tackle these challenges by constructing instruction-tuning data for specialized domains using unlabeled data. By incorporating logic and inspection into the data generation process, AQuilt encourages reasoning processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. The framework allows for customizable task instructions, enabling high-quality data generation for any task. Experiments demonstrate that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3 while requiring only 17% of the production cost.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations, while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic, and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover, customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3 while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source code, models, and scripts are available at https://github.com/Krueske/AQuilt.

<div> optimization, reasoning abilities, large language models, prompt model, textual feedback

Summary:
The Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt) introduces a new approach to improving reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating textual feedback into prompt model training. This framework does not require dataset collection and iteratively improves prompts based on feedback. By leveraging textual rewards, TRPrompt can train a prompt model that generates state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for challenging math problems. This unified approach combines methods that use textual feedback and numerical rewards to enhance the capabilities of LLMs. TRPrompt benefits from the high-resolution signal provided by textual rewards and allows the prompt model to internalize what constitutes a "good" prompt. As a result, TRPrompt achieves impressive results on math datasets such as GSMHard and MATH. <div>
arXiv:2507.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model, tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good" prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

Summary:<br /><br />Language models need adaptation to understand and follow user instructions effectively. This study introduces a novel approach called Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback (RLCF), which uses flexible, instruction-specific criteria to improve instruction following. By extracting checklists from instructions and evaluating responses against them, RLCF computes rewards for reinforcement learning. Compared to other alignment methods, RLCF shows significant performance improvements on five benchmark tasks, including notable increases in satisfaction rates and win rates. These results highlight the potential of checklist feedback in enhancing language models' ability to meet diverse user needs.

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions. Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF). From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs - then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a 3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that express a multitude of needs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes, \textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration}, \textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements, acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving. While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI education.

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models, such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright, safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner (CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder. We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were 13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and generalization across vision-language domains.

<title>RECALLED: An Unbounded Resource Consumption Attack on Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap, we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on \textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall} adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26 $\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense development against RCAs.

Abstract: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable, efficient, and performant reinforcement learning algorithm for training large language models. Unlike previous algorithms that adopt token-level importance ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3 models.

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular, task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging. For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name. These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

<title>Recent Trends in Distant Conversational Speech Recognition: A Review of CHiME-7 and 8 DASR Challenges</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges' design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1) Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation, suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques. Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive system ensembles.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings). We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR. LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences. However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design. Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool. Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona agents' perspectives.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety `aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of $46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism, enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models, both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces \texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively. Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types, particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models' generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a robust solution for clinical applications.

<title>SynC: Synthetic Image Caption Dataset Refinement with One-to-many Mapping for Zero-shot Image Captioning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18616</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.18616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC. Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Abstract: Generated texts from large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit a variety of harmful, human-like biases against various demographics. These findings motivate research efforts aiming to understand and measure such effects. This paper introduces a causal formulation for bias measurement in generative language models. Based on this theoretical foundation, we outline a list of desiderata for designing robust bias benchmarks. We then propose a benchmark called OccuGender, with a bias-measuring procedure to investigate occupational gender bias. We test several state-of-the-art open-source LLMs on OccuGender, including Llama, Mistral, and their instruction-tuned versions. The results show that these models exhibit substantial occupational gender bias. Lastly, we discuss prompting strategies for bias mitigation and an extension of our causal formulation to illustrate the generalizability of our framework.

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to correct outdated or inaccurate knowledge in neural networks. In this paper, we explore knowledge editing using easily accessible documents instead of manually labeled factual triples employed in earlier research. To advance this field, we establish the first evaluation benchmark, \textit{DocTER}, featuring Documents containing counterfactual knowledge for editing. A comprehensive four-perspective evaluation is introduced: Edit Success, Locality, Reasoning, and Cross-lingual Transfer. To adapt conventional triplet-based knowledge editing methods for this task, we develop an Extract-then-Edit pipeline that extracts triples from documents before applying existing methods. Experiments on popular knowledge editing methods demonstrate that editing with documents presents significantly greater challenges than using triples. In document-based scenarios, even the best-performing in-context editing approach still lags behind by 10 points in editing success when compared to using gold triples. This observation also holds for both reasoning and cross-lingual test sets. We further analyze key factors influencing task performance, including the quality of extracted triples, the frequency and position of edited knowledge in documents, various methods for enhancing reasoning, and performance differences across various directions in cross-lingual knowledge editing, which provide valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Do American presidents speak discernibly different from each other? If so, in what ways? And are these differences confined to any single medium of communication? To investigate these questions, this paper introduces a novel metric of uniqueness based on large language models, develops a new lexicon for divisive speech, and presents a framework for assessing the distinctive ways in which presidents speak about their political opponents. Applying these tools to a variety of corpora of presidential speeches, we find considerable evidence that Donald Trump's speech patterns diverge from those of all major party nominees for the presidency in recent history. Trump is significantly more distinctive than his fellow Republicans, whose uniqueness values appear closer to those of the Democrats. Contributing to these differences is Trump's employment of divisive and antagonistic language, particularly when targeting his political opponents. These differences hold across a variety of measurement strategies, arise on both the campaign trail and in official presidential addresses, and do not appear to be an artifact of secular changes in presidential communications.

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) have attracted great attention in many applications, such as emotional support and role-playing. However, existing works primarily focus on modeling explicit character profiles, while ignoring the underlying personality traits that truly shape behaviors and decision-making, hampering the development of more anthropomorphic and psychologically-grounded AI systems. In this paper, we explore the modeling of Big Five personality traits, which is the most widely used trait theory in psychology, and propose P-React, a mixture of experts (MoE)-based personalized LLM. Particularly, we integrate a Personality Specialization Loss (PSL) to better capture individual trait expressions, providing a more nuanced and psychologically grounded personality simulacrum. To facilitate research in this field, we curate OCEAN-Chat, a high-quality, human-verified dataset designed to train LLMs in expressing personality traits across diverse topics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of P-React in maintaining consistent and real personality.

Abstract: Domain generalizability is a crucial aspect of a deep learning model since it determines the capability of the model to perform well on data from unseen domains. However, research on the domain generalizability of deep learning models for vision-language tasks remains limited, primarily because of the lack of required datasets. To address these challenges, we propose VolDoGer: Vision-Language Dataset for Domain Generalization, a dedicated dataset designed for domain generalization that addresses three vision-language tasks: image captioning, visual question answering, and visual entailment. We constructed VolDoGer by extending LLM-based data annotation techniques to vision-language tasks, thereby alleviating the burden of recruiting human annotators. We evaluated the domain generalizability of various models, ranging from fine-tuned models to a recent multimodal large language model, through VolDoGer.

<title>Identity-related Speech Suppression in Generative AI Content Moderation</title>

Abstract: Automated content moderation has long been used to help identify and filter undesired user-generated content online. But such systems have a history of incorrectly flagging content by and about marginalized identities for removal. Generative AI systems now use such filters to keep undesired generated content from being created by or shown to users. While a lot of focus has been given to making sure such systems do not produce undesired outcomes, considerably less attention has been paid to making sure appropriate text can be generated. From classrooms to Hollywood, as generative AI is increasingly used for creative or expressive text generation, whose stories will these technologies allow to be told, and whose will they suppress?
  In this paper, we define and introduce measures of speech suppression, focusing on speech related to different identity groups incorrectly filtered by a range of content moderation APIs. Using both short-form, user-generated datasets traditional in content moderation and longer generative AI-focused data, including two datasets we introduce in this work, we create a benchmark for measurement of speech suppression for nine identity groups. Across one traditional and four generative AI-focused automated content moderation services tested, we find that identity-related speech is more likely to be incorrectly suppressed than other speech. We find that reasons for incorrect flagging behavior vary by identity based on stereotypes and text associations, with, e.g., disability-related content more likely to be flagged for self-harm or health-related reasons while non-Christian content is more likely to be flagged as violent or hateful. As generative AI systems are increasingly used for creative work, we urge further attention to how this may impact the creation of identity-related content.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve in natural language processing (NLP), their ability to stably follow instructions in long-context inputs has become critical for real-world applications. However, existing benchmarks seldom focus on instruction-following in long-context scenarios or stability on different inputs. To bridge this gap, we introduce LIFBench, a scalable dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' instruction-following capabilities and stability across long contexts. LIFBench comprises three long-context scenarios and eleven diverse tasks, featuring 2,766 instructions generated through an automated expansion method across three dimensions: length, expression, and variables. For evaluation, we propose LIFEval, a rubric-based assessment method that enables precise, automated scoring of complex LLM responses without reliance on LLM-assisted assessments or human judgment. This method allows for a comprehensive analysis of model performance and stability from multiple perspectives. We conduct detailed experiments on 20 prominent LLMs across six length intervals. Our work contributes LIFBench and LIFEval as robust tools for assessing LLM performance in complex and long-context settings, offering valuable insights to guide future advancements in LLM development.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing size of large language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges in memory usage and computational costs. Quantizing both weights and activations can address these issues, with hardware-supported fine-grained scaling emerging as a promising solution to mitigate outliers. However, existing methods struggle to capture nuanced block data distributions. We propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that assigns a per-block optimal number format from a formatbook for better data representation. Additionally, we introduce DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4 variants (akin to dialects) that adapt to diverse data distributions. To leverage this efficiently, we propose a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization. Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures energy efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with low-precision integer arithmetic. BlockDialect achieves 10.78% (7.48%) accuracy gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with lower bit usage per data, while being only 5.45% (2.69%) below full precision even when quantizing full-path matrix multiplication. Focusing on how to represent over how to scale, our work presents a promising path for energy-efficient LLM inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence with capabilities in reasoning, coding, and communication, driving innovation across industries. Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. In this work, we introduce a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. We present a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. Our work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks requiring interpretive and inferential accuracy. In this paper, we introduce ExpliCa, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs in explicit causal reasoning. ExpliCa uniquely integrates both causal and temporal relations presented in different linguistic orders and explicitly expressed by linguistic connectives. The dataset is enriched with crowdsourced human acceptability ratings. We tested LLMs on ExpliCa through prompting and perplexity-based metrics. We assessed seven commercial and open-source LLMs, revealing that even top models struggle to reach 0.80 accuracy. Interestingly, models tend to confound temporal relations with causal ones, and their performance is also strongly influenced by the linguistic order of the events. Finally, perplexity-based scores and prompting performance are differently affected by model size.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become a crucial step for aligning pretrained large language models (LLMs) using supervised datasets of input-output pairs. However, despite being supervised, SFT is inherently limited by its generative training objective. To address its limitations, the existing common strategy is to follow SFT with a separate phase of preference optimization (PO), which relies on either human-labeled preference data or a strong reward model to guide the learning process. In this paper, we address the limitations of SFT by exploring one of the most successful techniques in conventional supervised learning: discriminative learning. We introduce Discriminative Fine-Tuning (DFT), an improved variant of SFT, which mitigates the burden of collecting human-labeled preference data or training strong reward models. Unlike SFT that employs a generative approach and overlooks negative data, DFT adopts a discriminative paradigm that increases the probability of positive answers while suppressing potentially negative ones, aiming for data prediction instead of token prediction. Our contributions include: (i) a discriminative probabilistic framework for fine-tuning LLMs by explicitly modeling the discriminative likelihood of an answer among all possible outputs given an input; (ii) efficient algorithms to optimize this discriminative likelihood; and (iii) extensive experiments demonstrating DFT's effectiveness, achieving performance better than SFT and comparable to if not better than SFT$\rightarrow$PO.

Abstract: Large language models accumulate vast knowledge during pre-training, yet the dynamics governing this acquisition remain poorly understood. This work investigates the learning dynamics of language models on a synthetic factual recall task, uncovering three key findings: First, language models learn in three phases, exhibiting a performance plateau before acquiring precise factual knowledge. Mechanistically, this plateau coincides with the formation of attention-based circuits that support recall. Second, the training data distribution significantly impacts learning dynamics, as imbalanced distributions lead to shorter plateaus. Finally, hallucinations emerge simultaneously with knowledge, and integrating new knowledge into the model through fine-tuning is challenging, as it quickly corrupts its existing parametric memories. Our results emphasize the importance of data distribution in knowledge acquisition and suggest novel data scheduling strategies to accelerate neural network training.

Abstract: Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a signal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also has no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of the emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours that have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such feedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was intended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how communication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we present a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an unbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural differences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine communicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this outcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of psychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared intentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of communication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible socially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a general but well-developed capacity for social cognition.

Abstract: Temporal Logic (TL), especially Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enables precise formal specification, making it widely used in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous driving and robotics. Automatically transforming NL into STL is an attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets, automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and  history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1) Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning patterns.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have opened up new avenues for producing synthetic data, particularly in the realm of structured tabular formats, such as product reviews. Despite the potential benefits, concerns regarding privacy leakage have surfaced, especially when personal information is utilized in the training datasets. In addition, there is an absence of a comprehensive evaluation framework capable of quantitatively measuring the quality of the generated synthetic data and their utility for downstream tasks. In response to this gap, we introduce SynEval, an open-source evaluation framework designed to assess the fidelity, utility, and privacy preservation of synthetically generated tabular data via a suite of diverse evaluation metrics. We validate the efficacy of our proposed framework - SynEval - by applying it to synthetic product review data generated by three state-of-the-art LLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, and Llama. Our experimental findings illuminate the trade-offs between various evaluation metrics in the context of synthetic data generation. Furthermore, SynEval stands as a critical instrument for researchers and practitioners engaged with synthetic tabular data,, empowering them to judiciously determine the suitability of the generated data for their specific applications, with an emphasis on upholding user privacy.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms play a critical role in decision-making across various domains, such as healthcare, finance, education, and law enforcement. However, concerns about fairness and bias in these systems have raised significant ethical and social challenges. To address these challenges, this research utilizes two prominent fairness libraries, Fairlearn by Microsoft and AIF360 by IBM. These libraries offer comprehensive frameworks for fairness analysis, providing tools to evaluate fairness metrics, visualize results, and implement bias mitigation algorithms. The study focuses on assessing and mitigating biases for unstructured datasets using Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. The primary objective is to present a comparative analysis of the performance of mitigation algorithms from the two fairness libraries. This analysis involves applying the algorithms individually, one at a time, in one of the stages of the ML lifecycle, pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing, as well as sequentially across more than one stage. The results reveal that some sequential applications improve the performance of mitigation algorithms by effectively reducing bias while maintaining the model's performance. Publicly available datasets from Kaggle were chosen for this research, providing a practical context for evaluating fairness in real-world machine learning workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of disinformation demands reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. We present Dynamic Evidence-based FAct-checking with Multimodal Experts (DEFAME), a modular, zero-shot MLLM pipeline for open-domain, text-image claim verification. DEFAME operates in a six-stage process, dynamically selecting the tools and search depth to extract and evaluate textual and visual evidence. Unlike prior approaches that are text-only, lack explainability, or rely solely on parametric knowledge, DEFAME performs end-to-end verification, accounting for images in claims and evidence while generating structured, multimodal reports. Evaluation on the popular benchmarks VERITE, AVerITeC, and MOCHEG shows that DEFAME surpasses all previous methods, establishing itself as the new state-of-the-art fact-checking system for uni- and multimodal fact-checking. Moreover, we introduce a new multimodal benchmark, ClaimReview2024+, featuring claims after the knowledge cutoff of GPT-4o, avoiding data leakage. Here, DEFAME drastically outperforms the GPT-4o baselines, showing temporal generalizability and the potential for real-time fact-checking.

Abstract: Evaluation plays a crucial role in the advancement of information retrieval (IR) models. However, current benchmarks, which are based on predefined domains and human-labeled data, face limitations in addressing evaluation needs for emerging domains both cost-effectively and efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose the Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark (AIR-Bench). AIR-Bench is distinguished by three key features: 1) Automated. The testing data in AIR-Bench is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) without human intervention. 2) Heterogeneous. The testing data in AIR-Bench is generated with respect to diverse tasks, domains and languages. 3) Dynamic. The domains and languages covered by AIR-Bench are constantly augmented to provide an increasingly comprehensive evaluation benchmark for community developers. We develop a reliable and robust data generation pipeline to automatically create diverse and high-quality evaluation datasets based on real-world corpora. Our findings demonstrate that the generated testing data in AIR-Bench aligns well with human-labeled testing data, making AIR-Bench a dependable benchmark for evaluating IR models. The resources in AIR-Bench are publicly available at https://github.com/AIR-Bench/AIR-Bench.

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) remain vulnerable to malicious prompts that induce harmful outputs. Existing safety benchmarks for VLMs primarily rely on automated evaluation methods, but these methods struggle to detect implicit harmful content or produce inaccurate evaluations. Therefore, we found that existing benchmarks have low levels of harmfulness, ambiguous data, and limited diversity in image-text pair combinations. To address these issues, we propose the ELITE benchmark, a high-quality safety evaluation benchmark for VLMs, underpinned by our enhanced evaluation method, the ELITE evaluator. The ELITE evaluator explicitly incorporates a toxicity score to accurately assess harmfulness in multimodal contexts, where VLMs often provide specific, convincing, but unharmful descriptions of images. We filter out ambiguous and low-quality image-text pairs from existing benchmarks using the ELITE evaluator and generate diverse combinations of safe and unsafe image-text pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that the ELITE evaluator achieves superior alignment with human evaluations compared to prior automated methods, and the ELITE benchmark offers enhanced benchmark quality and diversity. By introducing ELITE, we pave the way for safer, more robust VLMs, contributing essential tools for evaluating and mitigating safety risks in real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the significance of natural language in enhancing the controllability of generative models. While various efforts have been made to leverage natural language for content generation, research on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents utilizing text-based instructions for procedural content generation remains limited. In this paper, we propose IPCGRL, an instruction-based procedural content generation method via reinforcement learning, which incorporates a sentence embedding model. IPCGRL fine-tunes task-specific embedding representations to effectively compress game-level conditions. We evaluate IPCGRL in a two-dimensional level generation task and compare its performance with a general-purpose embedding method. The results indicate that IPCGRL achieves up to a 21.4% improvement in controllability and a 17.2% improvement in generalizability for unseen instructions. Furthermore, the proposed method extends the modality of conditional input, enabling a more flexible and expressive interaction framework for procedural content generation.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation can be a cost-effective technique to distill knowledge in Large Language Models, if the teacher output logits can be pre-computed and cached. However, successfully applying this to pre-training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we prove that naive approaches for sparse knowledge distillation such as caching Top-K probabilities, while intuitive, provide biased estimates of teacher probability distribution to the student, resulting in suboptimal performance and calibration. We propose an importance-sampling-based method `Random Sampling Knowledge Distillation', which provides unbiased estimates, preserves the gradient in expectation, and requires storing significantly sparser logits. Our method enables faster training of student models with marginal overhead (<10%) compared to cross-entropy based training, while maintaining competitive performance compared to full distillation, across a range of model sizes from 300M to 3B.

<title>LagKV: Lag-Relative Information of the KV Cache Tells Which Tokens Are Important</title>

arXiv:2504.04704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modification of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Based on the fact that the Large Language models are autoregressive models, we propose LagKV, a KV compression strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themselves. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on RULER benchmark show that, our approach outperforms SnapKV and StreamingLLM in different compression ratios. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our method outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $50\%$ with same compression ratios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as educational tools, yet evaluating their teaching capabilities remains challenging due to the resource-intensive, context-dependent, and methodologically complex nature of teacher-student interactions. We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating our methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation educational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical effectiveness.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.0% and 70.7% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-R1 across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1 shows steady performance improvements as the number of input video frames increases. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).

Summary:
Instruction-guided content selection (IGCS) is proposed as a unified framework for various content selection tasks in natural language processing. The framework encapsulates task definitions and specific requests as instructions to a language model. A unified benchmark, \igcsbench{}, is introduced to cover diverse content selection tasks. A large synthetic dataset is created to aid in transfer learning for enhanced performance across different tasks. Different content selection models can benefit from dedicated training or transfer learning using these datasets. The study also addresses inference time issues in language model-based content selection and proposes a generic evaluation metric. The resources and methods presented in the study are deemed valuable for the development of future content selection models. The models and datasets are available at https://github.com/shmuelamar/igcs.

Abstract: A broad range of NLP tasks involve selecting relevant text spans from given source texts. Despite this shared objective, such \textit{content selection} tasks have traditionally been studied in isolation, each with its own modeling approaches, datasets, and evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose \textit{instruction-guided content selection (IGCS)} as a beneficial unified framework for such settings, where the task definition and any instance-specific request are encapsulated as instructions to a language model. To promote this framework, we introduce \igcsbench{}, the first unified benchmark covering diverse content selection tasks. Further, we create a large generic synthetic dataset that can be leveraged for diverse content selection tasks, and show that transfer learning with these datasets often boosts performance, whether dedicated training for the targeted task is available or not. Finally, we address generic inference time issues that arise in LLM-based modeling of content selection, assess a generic evaluation metric, and overall propose the utility of our resources and methods for future content selection models.

<br />Summary: 
In a study conducted at Penda Health clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, the impact of AI Consult, a large language model-based clinical decision support tool, was evaluated in real-world clinical settings. The tool served as a safety net for clinicians, identifying potential errors in documentation and decision-making. Clinicians with access to AI Consult made significantly fewer errors, with 16% fewer diagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors compared to those without access. The implementation of AI Consult could potentially avert a substantial number of errors annually at Penda Health clinics. A survey of clinicians using AI Consult indicated that it improved the quality of care delivered, with 75% acknowledging a substantial effect. The study highlights the potential of language model-based tools in reducing errors in clinical practice when implemented in a workflow-aligned manner and actively deployed to encourage clinician uptake.

Abstract: We evaluate the impact of large language model-based clinical decision support in live care. In partnership with Penda Health, a network of primary care clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, we studied AI Consult, a tool that serves as a safety net for clinicians by identifying potential documentation and clinical decision-making errors. AI Consult integrates into clinician workflows, activating only when needed and preserving clinician autonomy. We conducted a quality improvement study, comparing outcomes for 39,849 patient visits performed by clinicians with or without access to AI Consult across 15 clinics. Visits were rated by independent physicians to identify clinical errors. Clinicians with access to AI Consult made relatively fewer errors: 16% fewer diagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors. In absolute terms, the introduction of AI Consult would avert diagnostic errors in 22,000 visits and treatment errors in 29,000 visits annually at Penda alone. In a survey of clinicians with AI Consult, all clinicians said that AI Consult improved the quality of care they delivered, with 75% saying the effect was "substantial". These results required a clinical workflow-aligned AI Consult implementation and active deployment to encourage clinician uptake. We hope this study demonstrates the potential for LLM-based clinical decision support tools to reduce errors in real-world settings and provides a practical framework for advancing responsible adoption.

<div> Generative Large Language Models, Conversational Information Retrieval, Unanswerable questions, Self-aware LLM, SALU

Summary:
Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU) is a novel approach that integrates unanswerability detection directly within Large Language Models (LLMs) for Conversational Information Retrieval systems. It utilizes a multi-task learning framework to handle Question Answering and abstention generation for unanswerable queries. Employing confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback, SALU effectively penalizes hallucinations and rewards appropriate abstentions, promoting self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. Experimental results on the C-IR_Answerability dataset demonstrate SALU's superiority over hybrid LLM-classifier systems in accurately answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation confirms SALU's reliability, with high factuality, appropriate abstention, and reduced hallucination. SALU excels in determining when to abstain from answering, showcasing its robustness in handling unanswerable queries. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) systems, while offering intuitive access to information, face a significant challenge: reliably handling unanswerable questions to prevent the generation of misleading or hallucinated content. Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines, including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination, demonstrating its ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'."

mKGQAgent is a framework for converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries by breaking down the task into modular subtasks. It uses a coordinated LLM agent workflow for planning, entity linking, and query refinement, guided by an experience pool for in-context learning. The approach efficiently handles multilingual KGQA and achieved first place in the Text2SPARQL challenge 2025 on DBpedia and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks. By taking a human-inspired approach, mKGQAgent opens up new possibilities for the development of human-like reasoning systems in multilingual semantic parsing. <div>

Abstract: Accessing knowledge via multilingual natural-language interfaces is one of the emerging challenges in the field of information retrieval and related ones. Structured knowledge stored in knowledge graphs can be queried via a specific query language (e.g., SPARQL). Therefore, one needs to transform natural-language input into a query to fulfill an information need. Prior approaches mostly focused on combining components (e.g., rule-based or neural-based) that solve downstream tasks and come up with an answer at the end. We introduce mKGQAgent, a human-inspired framework that breaks down the task of converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries into modular, interpretable subtasks. By leveraging a coordinated LLM agent workflow for planning, entity linking, and query refinement - guided by an experience pool for in-context learning - mKGQAgent efficiently handles multilingual KGQA. Evaluated on the DBpedia- and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks within the Text2SPARQL challenge 2025, our approach took first place among the other participants.

Abstract: Enabling farmers to access accurate agriculture-related information in their native languages in a timely manner is crucial for the success of the agriculture field. Although large language models (LLMs) can be used to implement Question Answering (QA) systems, simply using publicly available general-purpose LLMs in agriculture typically offer generic advisories, lacking precision in local and multilingual contexts due to insufficient domain-specific training and scarcity of high-quality, region-specific datasets. Our study addresses these limitations by generating multilingual synthetic agricultural datasets (English, Hindi, Punjabi) from agriculture-specific documents and fine-tuning language-specific LLMs. Our evaluation on curated multilingual datasets demonstrates significant improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the fine-tuned models compared to their baseline counterparts. These results highlight the efficacy of synthetic data-driven, language-specific fine-tuning as an effective strategy to improve the performance of LLMs in agriculture, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. By enabling more accurate and localized agricultural advisory services, this study provides a meaningful step toward bridging the knowledge gap in AI-driven agricultural solutions for diverse linguistic communities.

<div> name-based benchmarking, bias magnitude, accuracy, LLMs, nationality labels

Summary: 
The study investigates biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) towards nationalities using a name-based benchmarking approach. The research focuses on the impact of substituting explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names on bias magnitude and accuracy across LLMs from industry leaders like OpenAI and Google. Results show that smaller LLMs exhibit more bias and lower accuracy compared to larger models. For instance, in an ambiguous context, smaller models like Claude Haiku show higher stereotypical bias scores and lower accuracy than larger models like Claude Sonnet. Smaller models also retain a larger portion of errors when nationality references are replaced with names. The study emphasizes the persistence of biases in LLMs and their significant implications for the development and deployment of AI systems in diverse global contexts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit latent biases towards specific nationalities even when explicit demographic markers are not present. In this work, we introduce a novel name-based benchmarking approach derived from the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) dataset to investigate the impact of substituting explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names, a scenario more reflective of real-world LLM applications. Our novel approach examines how this substitution affects both bias magnitude and accuracy across a spectrum of LLMs from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Our experiments show that small models are less accurate and exhibit more bias compared to their larger counterparts. For instance, on our name-based dataset and in the ambiguous context (where the correct choice is not revealed), Claude Haiku exhibited the worst stereotypical bias scores of 9%, compared to only 3.5% for its larger counterpart, Claude Sonnet, where the latter also outperformed it by 117.7% in accuracy. Additionally, we find that small models retain a larger portion of existing errors in these ambiguous contexts. For example, after substituting names for explicit nationality references, GPT-4o retains 68% of the error rate versus 76% for GPT-4o-mini, with similar findings for other model providers, in the ambiguous context. Our research highlights the stubborn resilience of biases in LLMs, underscoring their profound implications for the development and deployment of AI systems in diverse, global contexts.

Summary: 
Generative language models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5 were used in this study to perform multi-label classification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs) from psychiatric electronic health records. The study introduced a novel pipeline and advanced evaluation methods for analyzing the models' performance. GPT-3.5 showed high accuracy and F1 score, while GPT-4.5 performed even better with guided prompting, particularly on rare label sets. Systematic error patterns were identified, such as the models confusing suicide ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA), as well as a tendency towards cautious over-labeling. The research demonstrates the potential of generative AI for complex clinical tasks and provides insights for structuring unstructured EHR data for large-scale clinical research and evidence-based medicine.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suicide remains a pressing global health crisis, with over 720,000 deaths annually and millions more affected by suicide ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA). Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs), including SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied AI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary classification task, overlooking the complexity of cooccurring risk factors. This study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs from psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end to end generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods, including label set level metrics and a multilabel confusion matrix for error analysis. Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match accuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior performance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets, indicating a more balanced and robust performance. Our findings reveal systematic error patterns, such as the conflation of SI and SA, and highlight the models tendency toward cautious over labeling. This work not only demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical classification tasks but also provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured EHR data to support large scale clinical research and evidence based medicine.

<div> keywords: pairwise preferences, large language models, annotation tools, external validation, performance improvement <br />
<br />
Summary: 
Pairwise preferences are commonly used to evaluate large language models by comparing two responses and selecting the better one. However, obtaining high-quality comparisons can be challenging in certain domains. This study explores the use of annotation tools to enhance the evaluation of responses in long-form factual, math, and code tasks. By incorporating external validation through web search and code execution, the system aims to provide more accurate feedback independent of the model's biases. Experimental results across various domains show that external tools can improve performance, but results may vary based on different parameters. The study underscores the need for better annotator benchmarks and highlights the impact of simple factors such as prompts on performance. The code for the system is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-agent-evaluator. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairwise preferences over model responses are widely collected to evaluate and provide feedback to large language models (LLMs). Given two alternative model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the "better" response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many, but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved (non-saturated) annotator benchmarks. We share our code at https://github.com/apple/ml-agent-evaluator.

Summary:
Our study focuses on efficient text embedding for large-scale NLP applications by utilizing binary representations (barcodes) instead of real-valued features. We introduce a Coordinate Search-based optimization framework to determine optimal thresholds for each feature when converting continuous embeddings into binary representations. By using feature-specific thresholds, we have observed improved performance in binary encoding, leading to accurate and efficient binary representations across various features. The optimal barcode representations generated through our method have shown promising results in different NLP tasks and datasets, surpassing traditional binarization methods in accuracy. This technique is versatile and can be applied to any features beyond NLP embeddings, making it beneficial for various machine learning applications. Our approach has the potential to revolutionize text representation in NLP and other domains where efficient storage and computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Efficient text embedding is crucial for large-scale natural language processing (NLP) applications, where storage and computational efficiency are key concerns. In this paper, we explore how using binary representations (barcodes) instead of real-valued features can be used for NLP embeddings derived from machine learning models such as BERT. Thresholding is a common method for converting continuous embeddings into binary representations, often using a fixed threshold across all features. We propose a Coordinate Search-based optimization framework that instead identifies the optimal threshold for each feature, demonstrating that feature-specific thresholds lead to improved performance in binary encoding. This ensures that the binary representations are both accurate and efficient, enhancing performance across various features. Our optimal barcode representations have shown promising results in various NLP applications, demonstrating their potential to transform text representation. We conducted extensive experiments and statistical tests on different NLP tasks and datasets to evaluate our approach and compare it to other thresholding methods. Binary embeddings generated using using optimal thresholds found by our method outperform traditional binarization methods in accuracy. This technique for generating binary representations is versatile and can be applied to any features, not just limited to NLP embeddings, making it useful for a wide range of domains in machine learning applications.

Abstract: Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) have emerged as a significant application direction for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically rely on prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning to enable models to imitate character behaviors in specific scenarios, but often neglect the underlying \emph{cognitive} mechanisms driving these behaviors. Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce \textbf{CogDual}, a novel RPLA adopting a \textit{cognize-then-respond } reasoning paradigm. By jointly modeling external situational awareness and internal self-awareness, CogDual generates responses with improved character consistency and contextual alignment. To further optimize the performance, we employ reinforcement learning with two general-purpose reward schemes designed for open-domain text generation. Extensive experiments on the CoSER benchmark, as well as Cross-MR and LifeChoice, demonstrate that CogDual consistently outperforms existing baselines and generalizes effectively across diverse role-playing tasks.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new benchmark called SKA-Bench, which aims to evaluate the structured knowledge understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs). SKA-Bench includes four types of structured knowledge: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. The benchmark consists of instances with questions, answers, positive and noisy knowledge units. It evaluates LLMs on four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. The study found that existing LLMs face challenges in understanding structured knowledge, with performance impacted by factors such as noise levels, order of knowledge units, and hallucination. The evaluation included 8 representative LLMs, revealing areas for improvement in structured knowledge understanding. Code and dataset for SKA-Bench are available on GitHub for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1, indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Lza12a/SKA-Bench.

Abstract: The booming development of AI agents presents unprecedented opportunities for automating complex tasks across various domains. However, their multi-step, multi-tool collaboration capabilities in the financial sector remain underexplored. This paper introduces FinGAIA, an end-to-end benchmark designed to evaluate the practical abilities of AI agents in the financial domain. FinGAIA comprises 407 meticulously crafted tasks, spanning seven major financial sub-domains: securities, funds, banking, insurance, futures, trusts, and asset management. These tasks are organized into three hierarchical levels of scenario depth: basic business analysis, asset decision support, and strategic risk management. We evaluated 10 mainstream AI agents in a zero-shot setting. The best-performing agent, ChatGPT, achieved an overall accuracy of 48.9\%, which, while superior to non-professionals, still lags financial experts by over 35 percentage points. Error analysis has revealed five recurring failure patterns: Cross-modal Alignment Deficiency, Financial Terminological Bias, Operational Process Awareness Barrier, among others. These patterns point to crucial directions for future research. Our work provides the first agent benchmark closely related to the financial domain, aiming to objectively assess and promote the development of agents in this crucial field.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the Moral Dilemma Dataset, consisting of real-world moral dilemmas with human moral judgments. It compares Large Language Models (LLMs) with human judgments, finding that models align closely with humans only in cases of high consensus. As human disagreement increases, alignment decreases. LLMs tend to rely on a narrower set of moral values compared to humans, leading to a pluralistic moral gap. To address this, the article introduces Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), which improves alignment with human judgments by 64.3% and enhances the diversity of moral values considered by LLMs. DMP offers a step towards more pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for moral advice, which may influence humans' decisions. Yet, little is known about how closely LLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral Dilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a distribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a free-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional alignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across dilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high consensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In parallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions extracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral values than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch in both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap, we introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.

Summary: 
CLARIFID is a novel framework designed to generate radiology reports that are both fluent and clinically reliable. It focuses on optimizing diagnostic correctness by following the workflow of expert radiologists. The framework includes section-aware pretraining to learn the logical flow from Findings to Impression, fine-tuning with Proximal Policy Optimization using the CheXbert F1 score as a reward, reasoning-aware decoding, and a multi-view encoder for comprehensive diagnostic coverage. During inference, a reasoning-aware next-token forcing strategy and report-level re-ranking ensure coherent clinical reasoning is preserved. Experimental results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset show that CLARIFID outperforms existing baselines in terms of both standard NLG metrics and clinically aware scores. This approach has the potential to alleviate radiologists' workload by providing accurate and comprehensive radiology reports automatically. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic generation of radiology reports has the potential to alleviate radiologists' significant workload, yet current methods struggle to deliver clinically reliable conclusions. In particular, most prior approaches focus on producing fluent text without effectively ensuring the factual correctness of the reports and often rely on single-view images, limiting diagnostic comprehensiveness. We propose CLARIFID, a novel framework that directly optimizes diagnostic correctness by mirroring the two-step workflow of experts. Specifically, CLARIFID (1) learns the logical flow from Findings to Impression through section-aware pretraining, (2) is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization in which the CheXbert F1 score of the Impression section serves as the reward, (3) enforces reasoning-aware decoding that completes "Findings" before synthesizing the "Impression", and (4) fuses multiple chest X-ray views via a vision-transformer-based multi-view encoder. During inference, we apply a reasoning-aware next-token forcing strategy followed by report-level re-ranking, ensuring that the model first produces a comprehensive Findings section before synthesizing the Impression and thereby preserving coherent clinical reasoning. Experimental results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior clinical efficacy and outperforms existing baselines on both standard NLG metrics and clinically aware scores.

<br />
Summary:
This study explores the impact of subjective factors like emotions, storytelling, and hedging on argument strength. While previous research has focused on individual subjective features, this analysis delves into the relationship between these features and argument quality on a larger scale. The study conducts regression analysis on datasets annotated for objective argument quality and subjective persuasion, revealing that storytelling and hedging have contrasting effects on objective and subjective argument quality. Additionally, the influence of emotions is found to depend on their rhetoric utilization rather than the domain being discussed. The research also compares and evaluates automated annotation methods for each subjective feature, contributing new resources to the field. Overall, the findings highlight the nuanced role of subjectivity in shaping the strength of arguments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In assessing argument strength, the notions of what makes a good argument are manifold. With the broader trend towards treating subjectivity as an asset and not a problem in NLP, new dimensions of argument quality are studied. Although studies on individual subjective features like personal stories exist, there is a lack of large-scale analyses of the relation between these features and argument strength. To address this gap, we conduct regression analysis to quantify the impact of subjective factors $-$ emotions, storytelling, and hedging $-$ on two standard datasets annotated for objective argument quality and subjective persuasion. As such, our contribution is twofold: at the level of contributed resources, as there are no datasets annotated with all studied dimensions, this work compares and evaluates automated annotation methods for each subjective feature. At the level of novel insights, our regression analysis uncovers different patterns of impact of subjective features on the two facets of argument strength encoded in the datasets. Our results show that storytelling and hedging have contrasting effects on objective and subjective argument quality, while the influence of emotions depends on their rhetoric utilization rather than the domain.

Summary:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular method for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with up-to-date information or external knowledge. However, the use of different embedding models in RAG can lead to varying response quality from LLMs. Two approaches are proposed to address this issue: Mixture-Embedding RAG, which combines benefits from multiple embedding models but does not outperform vanilla RAG, and Confident RAG, which selects responses with the highest confidence level, showing improvements over vanilla LLMs and RAG. The results are consistent across different LLMs and embedding models, making Confident RAG a versatile approach for various domains. The code for these approaches will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.

<div> benchmark, multilingual reasoning, Large Language Models, cultural context, native speakers

Summary:
- The article introduces the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a benchmark assessing Large Language Models (LLMs) on culturally grounded multilingual reasoning questions in French, Spanish, and Chinese.
- MultiNRC covers language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance.
- English equivalent translations of the multilingual questions allow for direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity across languages.
- Results show current LLMs struggle with native multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French, Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories: language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs. English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14 leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.

<div> interpretation, translation quality, real-time speech generation, voice cloning, latency reduction
<br />
Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 is an advanced Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) model that addresses key challenges in the translation industry. It offers high-fidelity, ultra-low-latency speech-to-speech generation with voice cloning capabilities. The model, based on an end-to-end framework, excels in translation accuracy and minimal latency through large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning. Human interpreters validated its correctness in complex scenarios, surpassing commercial SI solutions in translation quality. The average latency of cloned speech is significantly reduced from 10 seconds to near-real-time 3 seconds, making it highly practical and user-friendly. This innovative solution marks a significant advancement in SI technology, offering a more efficient and effective approach to real-time interpretation needs.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) represents one of the most daunting frontiers in the translation industry, with product-level automatic systems long plagued by intractable challenges: subpar transcription and translation quality, lack of real-time speech generation, multi-speaker confusion, and translated speech inflation, especially in long-form discourses. In this study, we introduce Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0, an end-to-end SI model that delivers high-fidelity, ultra-low-latency speech-to-speech generation with voice cloning capabilities. As a fully operational product-level solution, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 tackles these challenges head-on through our novel duplex speech-to-speech understanding-generating framework. Experimental results demonstrate that through large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning, the model achieves a significantly better balance between translation accuracy and latency, validated by human interpreters to exceed 70% correctness in complex scenarios. Notably, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 outperforms commercial SI solutions by significant margins in translation quality, while slashing the average latency of cloned speech from nearly 10 seconds to a near-real-time 3 seconds, which is around a near 70% reduction that drastically enhances practical usability.

<div> voice corpora, African ASR, synthetic voice data, ASR fine-tuning, low-resource languages

Summary:
Speech technology accessibility in Africa is limited, with over 2300 languages lacking support. A novel approach was introduced for creating synthetic voice corpora for African ASR, focusing on text creation, TTS voice synthesis, and ASR fine-tuning. Evaluation of synthetic text readability revealed promising results for several languages. Significant improvements in ASR were achieved for languages like Hausa, Dholuo, and Chichewa using a combination of real and synthetic data. Gender-disaggregated ASR performance was also evaluated. While synthetic data showed promise for low-resource languages, variances in improvement were observed. Areas for improvement include reviewer protocols and evaluation dataset accuracy. The released data and models aim to foster further advancements in synthetic data for African languages. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech technology remains out of reach for most of the over 2300 languages in Africa. We present the first systematic assessment of large-scale synthetic voice corpora for African ASR. We apply a three-step process: LLM-driven text creation, TTS voice synthesis, and ASR fine-tuning. Eight out of ten languages for which we create synthetic text achieved readability scores above 5 out of 7. We evaluated ASR improvement for three (Hausa, Dholuo, Chichewa) and created more than 2,500 hours of synthetic voice data at below 1% of the cost of real data. Fine-tuned Wav2Vec-BERT-2.0 models trained on 250h real and 250h synthetic Hausa matched a 500h real-data-only baseline, while 579h real and 450h to 993h synthetic data created the best performance. We also present gender-disaggregated ASR performance evaluation. For very low-resource languages, gains varied: Chichewa WER improved about 6.5% relative with a 1:2 real-to-synthetic ratio; a 1:1 ratio for Dholuo showed similar improvements on some evaluation data, but not on others. Investigating intercoder reliability, ASR errors and evaluation datasets revealed the need for more robust reviewer protocols and more accurate evaluation data. All data and models are publicly released to invite further work to improve synthetic data for African languages.

<title>A Hybrid Early-Exit Algorithm for Large Language Models Based on Space Alignment Decoding (SPADE)</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, early-exit algorithms, intermediate layer representations, SPADE decoding, entropy-based confidence metrics 

Summary: 
SPADE (SPace Alignment DEcoding) is introduced as a novel decoding method in the realm of large language models. The method aims to align intermediate layer representations with the output layer to enhance decoding accuracy. By propagating a reduced sequence containing only the start token and answer token, SPADE improves the alignment and reduces inference costs. To optimize early-exit decision-making, a linear approximation of SPADE is trained to compute entropy-based confidence metrics, enabling efficient monitoring of confidence levels during inference. The integration of SPADE and confidence metrics results in a hybrid early-exit algorithm that ensures both cost-effective and accurate outputs. This approach offers a scalable solution for deploying large language models in real-world applications, addressing the computational challenges associated with deep structures while maintaining high-quality performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are computationally expensive due to their deep structures. Prior research has shown that intermediate layers contain sufficient information to generate accurate answers, leading to the development of early-exit algorithms that reduce inference costs by terminating computation at earlier layers. However, these methods often suffer from poor performance due to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations that lead to decoding inaccuracy. To address these challenges, we propose SPADE (SPace Alignment DEcoding), a novel decoding method that aligns intermediate layer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced sequence consisting of only the start token and the answer token. We further optimize the early-exit decision-making process by training a linear approximation of SPADE that computes entropy-based confidence metrics. Putting them together, we create a hybrid early-exit algorithm that monitors confidence levels and stops inference at intermediate layers while using SPADE to generate high-quality outputs. This approach significantly reduces inference costs without compromising accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for deploying large language models in real-world applications.

WSM outperforms the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks, achieving significant performance improvements. It identifies merge duration as a critical factor influencing model performance and highlights the potential of WSM for long-term model refinement.

Abstract: Recent advances in learning rate (LR) scheduling have demonstrated the effectiveness of decay-free approaches that eliminate the traditional decay phase while maintaining competitive performance. Model merging techniques have emerged as particularly promising solutions in this domain. We present Warmup-Stable and Merge (WSM), a general framework that establishes a formal connection between learning rate decay and model merging. WSM provides a unified theoretical foundation for emulating various decay strategies-including cosine decay, linear decay and inverse square root decay-as principled model averaging schemes, while remaining fully compatible with diverse optimization methods. Through extensive experiments, we identify merge duration-the training window for checkpoint aggregation-as the most critical factor influencing model performance, surpassing the importance of both checkpoint interval and merge quantity. Our framework consistently outperforms the widely-adopted Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements of +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on MMLU-Pro. The performance advantages extend to supervised fine-tuning scenarios, highlighting WSM's potential for long-term model refinement.

Summary: <br />
This study introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning in politics. LLMs prove to be as effective as human coders and outperform conventional machine learning methods. By analyzing 18 million tweets from parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017 and 2022, the study reveals that governing parties use less negative messaging compared to ideologically extreme and populist parties, especially those on the radical right. These findings highlight how party characteristics influence strategic communication in multiparty systems. The research demonstrates the potential of LLMs for scalable and replicable research in political communication across different linguistic and cultural contexts. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First, it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18 million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017 and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.

Summary: 
Efficiency Leverage (EL) is introduced as a metric to quantify the computational advantage of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models over dense equivalents. The study investigated the impact of MoE architectural configurations on EL, revealing that expert activation ratio and total compute budget drive EL, following predictable power laws. Expert granularity acts as a modulator with an optimal range. A unified scaling law was derived to predict EL based on MoE configuration. Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with 0.85B active parameters, matched the performance of a 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources, validating the scaling laws. This research provides a principled and empirical foundation for efficiently scaling MoE models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from computational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge: predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources, thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a principled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE models.

Abstract: AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters, prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard, from a deployed AI medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms baseline approaches in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation methodology. In offline research settings, the checklist can help identify notes likely to fall below our chosen quality thresholds.

This AI technology offers a more natural and adaptive respondent experience compared to earlier IVR systems. The system built and tested for quantitative surveys utilized large language models, ASR, and speech synthesis technologies while following research best practices. Two pilot surveys were conducted with the SSRS Opinion Panel, and a human-administered survey assessed respondent experiences. Key metrics of survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent satisfaction scores were measured, indicating that shorter instruments and responsive AI interviewers could improve all three metrics. Overall, the use of AI in telephone surveys shows promise for scaling quantitative studies while maintaining methodological rigor.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: With the rise of voice-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) systems, quantitative survey researchers have access to a new data-collection mode: AI telephone surveying. By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can scale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like interactivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used interactive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI enables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust to interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.
  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech synthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative research, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.
  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent satisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three metrics studied.

Abstract: We present Megrez2, a novel lightweight and high-performance language model architecture optimized for device native deployment. Megrez2 introduces a novel cross-layer expert sharing mechanism, which significantly reduces total parameter count by reusing expert modules across adjacent transformer layers while maintaining most of the model's capacity. It also incorporates pre-gated routing, enabling memory-efficient expert loading and faster inference. As the first instantiation of the Megrez2 architecture, we introduce the Megrez2-Preview model, which is pre-trained on a 5-trillion-token corpus and further enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. With only 3B activated and 7.5B stored parameters, Megrez2-Preview demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to larger models on a wide range of tasks, including language understanding, instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. These results highlight the effectiveness of the Megrez2 architecture to achieve a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it a strong candidate for real-world, resource-constrained applications.

<div> Keywords: language models, QA datasets, debate-driven evaluation, adversarial debates, reasoning ability

Summary: 
A new evaluation paradigm is introduced to address concerns with current QA benchmarks that language models are saturating. The proposal involves transforming existing QA datasets into structured adversarial debates, where models defend official answers against alternative answers in multi-round argumentation. This approach increases difficulty, penalizes memorization, and reduces curation costs by reusing QA items. The authors provide an evaluation pipeline for converting QA tasks into debate-based assessments and a public benchmark demonstrating the method's effectiveness on MMLU-Pro questions. Empirical results show the robustness of the approach against data contamination and the ability of even weaker judges to differentiate stronger debaters. The study highlights the sustainable measurement of genuine reasoning ability in advanced language models, emphasizing the need for more than just pretraining on test sets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As frontier language models increasingly saturate standard QA benchmarks, concerns about data contamination, memorization, and escalating dataset creation costs persist. We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that transforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where one model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and defends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the correct solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach substantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet reuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions: (1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based assessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's effectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized protocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of the method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%) but performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can reliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based evaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks. Overall, our framework underscores that "pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need," offering a sustainable path for measuring the genuine reasoning ability of advanced language models.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric and topic analysis of the disaster informatics literature published between January 2020 to September 2022. Leveraging a large-scale corpus and advanced techniques such as pre-trained language models and generative AI, we identify the most active countries, institutions, authors, collaboration networks, emergent topics, patterns among the most significant topics, and shifts in research priorities spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight (1) countries that were most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic were also among the most active, with each country having specific research interests, (2) countries and institutions within the same region or share a common language tend to collaborate, (3) top active authors tend to form close partnerships with one or two key partners, (4) authors typically specialized in one or two specific topics, while institutions had more diverse interests across several topics, and (5) the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced research priorities in disaster informatics, placing greater emphasis on public health. We further demonstrate that the field is converging on multidimensional resilience strategies and cross-sectoral data-sharing collaborations or projects, reflecting a heightened awareness of global vulnerability and interdependency. Collecting and quality assurance strategies, data analytic practices, LLM-based topic extraction and summarization approaches, and result visualization tools can be applied to comparable datasets or solve similar analytic problems. By mapping out the trends in disaster informatics, our analysis offers strategic insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars aiming to enhance disaster informatics capacities in an increasingly uncertain and complex risk landscape.

Summary:
QMKGF is a Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation. It addresses the limitations of existing RAG studies by constructing a knowledge graph based on prompt templates and employing a multi-path subgraph construction strategy to improve semantic relevance. A query-aware attention reward model scores subgraph triples based on query relevance, selecting and enriching subgraphs to improve semantic representation. Evaluation on multiple datasets shows QMKGF outperforming existing methods, achieving a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98% on the HotpotQA dataset, surpassing BGE-Rerank by 9.72 percentage points. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QMKGF approach.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gradually emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the accuracy and factual consistency of content generated by large language models (LLMs). However, existing RAG studies primarily focus on retrieving isolated segments using similarity-based matching methods, while overlooking the intrinsic connections between them. This limitation hampers performance in RAG tasks. To address this, we propose QMKGF, a Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation. First, we design prompt templates and employ general-purpose LLMs to extract entities and relations, thereby generating a knowledge graph (KG) efficiently. Based on the constructed KG, we introduce a multi-path subgraph construction strategy that incorporates one-hop relations, multi-hop relations, and importance-based relations, aiming to improve the semantic relevance between the retrieved documents and the user query. Subsequently, we designed a query-aware attention reward model that scores subgraph triples based on their semantic relevance to the query. Then, we select the highest score subgraph and enrich subgraph with additional triples from other subgraphs that are highly semantically relevant to the query. Finally, the entities, relations, and triples within the updated subgraph are utilised to expand the original query, thereby enhancing its semantic representation and improving the quality of LLMs' generation. We evaluate QMKGF on the SQuAD, IIRC, Culture, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue datasets. On the HotpotQA dataset, our method achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98\%, surpassing the BGE-Rerank approach by 9.72 percentage points (from 55.26\% to 64.98\%). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QMKGF approach.

<div> Keywords: Jamaican Patois, speech recognition, music, data-centric approach, language modeling <br />
Summary:
A data-centric approach was taken to improve speech recognition systems for Jamaican Patois music. Over 40 hours of manually transcribed Patois music was curated for fine-tuning automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. The results were used to develop scaling laws for the performance of Whisper models on Jamaican Patois audio. Current systems perform poorly on Patois music, leading to inaccurate captions that limit accessibility. By improving ASR models, the goal is to enhance accessibility to Jamaican Patois music and support future language modeling efforts. This work addresses the need for accurate transcription of Jamaican Patois music and aims to pave the way for better recognition and understanding of this widely spoken language. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Although Jamaican Patois is a widely spoken language, current speech recognition systems perform poorly on Patois music, producing inaccurate captions that limit accessibility and hinder downstream applications. In this work, we take a data-centric approach to this problem by curating more than 40 hours of manually transcribed Patois music. We use this dataset to fine-tune state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, and use the results to develop scaling laws for the performance of Whisper models on Jamaican Patois audio. We hope that this work will have a positive impact on the accessibility of Jamaican Patois music and the future of Jamaican Patois language modeling.

Summary:
<br /><br />
Voice-based conversational AI systems often rely on cascaded architectures combining speech-to-text (STT), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS) components. This study compared different STT x LLM x TTS stacks using data from over 300,000 AI-conducted job interviews. The analysis revealed that Google STT paired with GPT-4.1 performed significantly better in conversational and technical quality metrics. Surprisingly, user satisfaction scores did not strongly correlate with objective quality metrics, suggesting that factors beyond technical performance influence user experience in voice-based AI systems. This study provides practical insights for selecting components in multimodal conversational AI systems and introduces a validated evaluation methodology for voice-based interactions. <div>

Abstract: Voice-based conversational AI systems increasingly rely on cascaded architectures combining speech-to-text (STT), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS) components. However, systematic evaluation of different component combinations in production settings remains understudied. We present a large-scale empirical comparison of STT x LLM x TTS stacks using data from over 300,000 AI-conducted job interviews. We develop an automated evaluation framework using LLM-as-a-Judge to assess conversational quality, technical accuracy, and skill assessment capabilities. Our analysis of four production configurations reveals that Google STT paired with GPT-4.1 significantly outperforms alternatives in both conversational and technical quality metrics. Surprisingly, we find that objective quality metrics correlate weakly with user satisfaction scores, suggesting that user experience in voice-based AI systems depends on factors beyond technical performance. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting components in multimodal conversational AI systems and contribute a validated evaluation methodology for voice-based interactions.

<div> alignment-free method, mispronunciation detection, phoneme-level pronunciation assessment, CTC-trained ASR models, state-of-the-art results

Summary:
This study focuses on mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) in computer aided language learning systems, particularly at the phoneme level. Traditional methods rely on pre-segmenting speech into phonetic units, limiting accuracy. The authors propose a self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) method that allows the use of CTC-trained ASR models for MDD. Additionally, they introduce a more general alignment-free method, GOP-AF, considering all possible alignments of the target phoneme. Theoretical explanations, implementation details, and normalization techniques for GOP-AF are provided. Experimental results on CMU Kids and Speechocean762 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, with GOP-AF showing dependency on peakiness of acoustic models and context around the phoneme. Comparison with other studies on the Speechocean762 dataset illustrates that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in phoneme-level pronunciation assessment. <div>

Abstract: Mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) is a significant part in modern computer aided language learning (CALL) systems. Within MDD, phoneme-level pronunciation assessment is key to helping L2 learners improve their pronunciation. However, most systems are based on a form of goodness of pronunciation (GOP) which requires pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic units. This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use modern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first propose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR models for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes all possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a theoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves potential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the method applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We provide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762 datasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the dependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount of context around the target phoneme. Finally, we compare our methods with recent studies over the Speechocean762 data showing that the feature vectors derived from the proposed method achieve state-of-the-art results on phoneme-level pronunciation assessment.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, perception, Turing Eye Test, benchmark, vision tower

Summary:
The paper introduces the Turing Eye Test (TET), a benchmark focusing on perception rather than reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It consists of four diagnostic tasks that assess MLLMs' performance on synthetic images. The study reveals that current MLLMs struggle with tasks that are easy for humans, showcasing a gap in visual perception abilities. In-context learning and language backbone training do not improve MLLMs' performance on TET tasks; however, fine-tuning the vision tower leads to rapid adaptation. This highlights the challenge of visual generalization for MLLMs, indicating a difference between MLLMs and human perception. A subset of TET tasks is released in this version, with plans for more diverse tasks in future work. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning, we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods to enhance visual generalization in future work.

Summary: 
ReMeX dataset is constructed for relation-aware, multi-entity Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) with detailed image-text-relation annotations. The ReMeREC framework is proposed to localize multiple entities and model their inter-relations by leveraging visual and textual cues. The Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP) infers entity quantity and span from textual cues, improving semantic ambiguity. The Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and global scene understanding. An auxiliary dataset, EntityText, is constructed using large language models to improve language comprehension for fine-grained prompts. Experimental results demonstrate ReMeREC's state-of-the-art performance in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, surpassing existing approaches significantly.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained, paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally, our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset, EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing approaches by a large margin.

Abstract: Large language models can be quantized to reduce inference time latency, model size, and energy consumption, thereby delivering a better user experience at lower cost. A challenge exists to deliver quantized models with minimal loss of accuracy in reasonable time, and in particular to do so without requiring mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators. Here, we demonstrate a simple, end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that, with an increase in total model training budget of less than 0.1%, outperforms the leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern benchmarks, with both base and instruct model variants. The approach easily generalizes across different model architectures, can be applied to activations, cache, and weights, and requires the introduction of no additional operations to the model other than the quantization itself.

Summary:
State probing is used to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) understanding of real-world phenomena in the context of cooking recipes. A new Japanese recipe dataset is constructed with detailed annotations of ingredient state changes to assess LLMs' ability to recognize intermediate states during cooking. Three tasks are designed to test whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify ingredients at various stages. Experiments with popular LLMs like Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B demonstrate that incorporating ingredient state knowledge enhances their comprehension of cooking processes, resulting in performance comparable to commercial LLMs. This approach highlights the importance of considering intermediate ingredient states in training LLMs for accurate understanding and generation of cooking recipes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of procedural texts, but they do not directly observe real-world phenomena. In the context of cooking recipes, this poses a challenge, as intermediate states of ingredients are often omitted, making it difficult for models to track ingredient states and understand recipes accurately. In this paper, we apply state probing, a method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We first construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate annotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and controlled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to evaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify ingredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used LLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving performance comparable to commercial LLMs.

Summary: 
The article introduces Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models (LLMs) trained with tabular data. The structured and explicit nature of tabular data containing personally identifiable information makes LLMs vulnerable to privacy risks. By assessing state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data in various encoding formats, the study reveals that LLMs memorize tabular data differently based on encoding formats, leading to high vulnerability to extraction through MIAs. The evaluation demonstrates that even with minimal fine-tuning, LLMs exhibit significant susceptibility to MIAs, with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic evaluation of these risks and sets a foundation for developing privacy-preserving techniques for tabular data in LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which, unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information (PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used. Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables. Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.

Abstract: License plate recognition in open environments is widely applicable across various domains; however, the diversity of license plate types and imaging conditions presents significant challenges. To address the limitations encountered by CNN and CRNN-based approaches in license plate recognition, this paper proposes a unified solution that integrates a lightweight visual encoder with a text decoder, within a pre-training framework tailored for single and double-line Chinese license plates. To mitigate the scarcity of double-line license plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate dataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and blending them with authentic license plate images. Furthermore, to enhance the system's recognition accuracy, we introduce a perspective correction network (PTN) that employs license plate corner coordinate regression as an implicit variable, supervised by license plate view classification information. This network offers improved stability, interpretability, and low annotation costs. The proposed algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.34% on the corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance. When evaluated under fine localization disturbance, the accuracy further improves to 99.58%. On the double-line license plate test set, it achieves an average recognition accuracy of 98.70%, with processing speeds reaching up to 167 frames per second, indicating strong practical applicability.

Summary:
The paper introduces a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT) that addresses the limitation of requiring adaptive optimizers like AdamW for training Transformers. DNT strategically integrates normalization techniques within Transformers to modulate Jacobian matrices, balance weights, activations, and their interactions, and concentrate gradient distributions. The normalization technique used in DNT is theoretically justified and empirically validated through comparisons with ViT and GPT architectures, showing superior performance. DNT enables seamless training with vanilla momentum SGDW, demonstrating comparable performance to Transformers trained with AdamW. <div>

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto backbone of modern deep learning, yet their training typically demands an advanced optimizer with adaptive learning rate like AdamW, rather than a momentum SGDW (mSGDW). Previous works show that it is mainly due to a heavy-tailed distribution of the gradients. In this paper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is meticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training with vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers trained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate normalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively modulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights, activations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of gradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the normalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on two popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its counterparts (\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with vanilla mSGDW.

<div> alignment, reinforcement learning, reward modeling, policy optimization, language models
<br />
Unified Reward & Policy Optimization (URPO) is a new framework that combines instruction-following and reward modeling into a single model and training phase. This approach eliminates the need for a separate reward model in large-scale alignment pipelines and enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and generate its own rewards for open-ended tasks. Experimental results using the Qwen2.5-7B model show that URPO outperforms baseline methods, with improved instruction-following scores and reasoning averages. Additionally, URPO produces a superior internal evaluator compared to traditional reward models. By promoting a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO simplifies the alignment process, making it more efficient and effective for language models.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex, resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24 to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore, URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training, achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly aligned language models.

<div> Keywords: Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels, Beyond-Semantic Speech, affective cues, contextual dynamics, implicit semantics 

Summary:
The article introduces a framework called Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5) to demonstrate the evolution of speech technologies towards human-like social interaction. It highlights the limitations of current speech technologies like ASR and TTS in capturing beyond-semantic dimensions of communication. The concept of Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS) is proposed to encompass emotional cues, contextual dynamics, and implicit semantics in speech communication. A formalized framework for BoSS is presented, utilizing cognitive relevance theories and machine learning models to analyze speech dynamics. The evaluation across five dimensions shows that current speech language models struggle to interpret beyond-semantic signals effectively. The study emphasizes the importance of advancing research in BoSS to enhance human-machine communication with richer context awareness.

Abstract: Human communication involves more than explicit semantics, with implicit signals and contextual cues playing a critical role in shaping meaning. However, modern speech technologies, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) often fail to capture these beyond-semantic dimensions. To better characterize and benchmark the progression of speech intelligence, we introduce Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5), a hierarchical framework illustrated the evolution of spoken dialogue systems from basic command recognition to human-like social interaction. To support these advanced capabilities, we propose Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS), which refers to the set of information in speech communication that encompasses but transcends explicit semantics. It conveys emotions, contexts, and modifies or extends meanings through multidimensional features such as affective cues, contextual dynamics, and implicit semantics, thereby enhancing the understanding of communicative intentions and scenarios. We present a formalized framework for BoSS, leveraging cognitive relevance theories and machine learning models to analyze temporal and contextual speech dynamics. We evaluate BoSS-related attributes across five different dimensions, reveals that current spoken language models (SLMs) are hard to fully interpret beyond-semantic signals. These findings highlight the need for advancing BoSS research to enable richer, more context-aware human-machine communication.

Summary:  
- D2P-MMT is proposed for robust vision-guided translation utilizing a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework.  
- It requires only the source text and a reconstructed image, filtering out irrelevant visual noise while preserving semantic cues.  
- The model learns from authentic and reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, fostering rich cross-modal interactions.  
- A distributional alignment loss ensures consistency between the output distributions of the two branches to bridge the modality gap and mitigate training-inference discrepancies.  
- Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress, state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches. Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Summary:
Rubrics as Rewards (RaR) proposes a framework using structured rubrics as interpretable reward signals for on-policy training with GRPO. The traditional approaches lack a definitive ground truth for post-training language models, making it challenging to define reliable reward signals. RaR outperforms Likert-based methods by up to a 28% relative improvement on HealthBench-1k while matching or surpassing expert-written references. By treating rubrics as structured reward signals, RaR enables smaller-scale judge models to better align with human preferences and maintain robust performance across different model scales. This approach balances objective and subjective evaluation criteria for real-world tasks, providing interpretability and reliability in the reward signals used for reinforcement learning. <br /><br />Summary: Rubrics as Rewards (RaR) framework utilizes structured rubrics as interpretable rewards for on-policy training, outperforming Likert-based methods and expert-written references, improving alignment with human preferences and maintaining robust performance across different model scales. <div>

Abstract: Extending Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to real-world tasks often requires balancing objective and subjective evaluation criteria. However, many such tasks lack a single, unambiguous ground truth-making it difficult to define reliable reward signals for post-training language models. While traditional preference-based methods offer a workaround, they rely on opaque reward functions that are difficult to interpret and prone to spurious correlations. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), a framework that uses structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals for on-policy training with GRPO. Our best RaR method yields up to a $28\%$ relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to simple Likert-based approaches, while matching or surpassing the performance of reward signals derived from expert-written references. By treating rubrics as structured reward signals, we show that RaR enables smaller-scale judge models to better align with human preferences and sustain robust performance across model scales.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for context-grounded tasks like summarization and question-answering, understanding what makes an LLM produce a certain response is challenging. We propose Multi-Level Explanations for Generative Language Models (MExGen), a technique to provide explanations for context-grounded text generation. MExGen assigns scores to parts of the context to quantify their influence on the model's output. It extends attribution methods like LIME and SHAP to LLMs used in context-grounded tasks where (1) inference cost is high, (2) input text is long, and (3) the output is text. We conduct a systematic evaluation, both automated and human, of perturbation-based attribution methods for summarization and question answering. The results show that our framework can provide more faithful explanations of generated output than available alternatives, including LLM self-explanations. We open-source code for MExGen as part of the ICX360 toolkit: https://github$.$com/IBM/ICX360.

This study investigates the impact of historical text normalization on the classification of medieval charters, particularly in terms of document dating and locating. A dataset of Middle High German charters from a digital archive is used to evaluate different classifiers, including traditional and transformer-based models, with and without normalization. The results show that while normalization slightly improves locating tasks, it hinders accuracy for dating, suggesting that original texts contain essential features that normalization may obscure. Support vector machines and gradient boosting are found to outperform other models, leading to doubts about the efficiency of transformers for this specific case. The findings advocate for a judicious approach to historical text normalization, highlighting the importance of preserving certain textual characteristics vital for classification tasks in document analysis.<br /><br />Summary: This study examines the impact of historical text normalization on medieval charters classification, revealing that while normalization offers some benefits for locating tasks, it can reduce accuracy for dating.

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) has emerged as a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP), aimed at automatically detecting causal relationships between events in text. In this comprehensive survey, we systematically elucidate the foundational principles and technical frameworks of ECI, proposing a novel classification framework to categorize and clarify existing methods. {We discuss associated challenges, provide quantitative evaluations, and outline future directions for this dynamic and rapidly evolving field. We first delineate key definitions, problem formalization, and evaluation protocols of ECI. Our classification framework organizes ECI methods based on two primary tasks: Sentence-level Event Causality Identification (SECI) and Document-level Event Causality Identification (DECI). For SECI, we review methods including feature pattern-based matching, machine learning-based classification, deep semantic encoding, prompt-based fine-tuning, and causal knowledge pre-training, alongside common data augmentation strategies. For DECI, we focus on techniques such as deep semantic encoding, event graph reasoning, and prompt-based fine-tuning. We dedicate specific discussions to advancements in multi-lingual and cross-lingual ECI as well as zero-shot ECI leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and unresolved challenges of each method. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on four benchmark datasets to assess various ECI methods. Finally, we explore future research directions.

Abstract: Previous approaches to persona simulation large language models (LLMs) have typically relied on learning basic biographical information, or using limited role-play dialogue datasets to capture a character's responses. However, a holistic representation of an individual goes beyond surface-level facts or conversations to deeper thoughts and thinking. In this work, we introduce CharacterBot, a model designed to replicate both the linguistic patterns and distinctive thought processes of a character. Using Lu Xun, a renowned Chinese writer, as a case study, we propose four training tasks derived from his 17 essay collections. These include a pre-training task focused on mastering external linguistic structures and knowledge, as well as three fine-tuning tasks: multiple-choice question answering, generative question answering, and style transfer, each aligning the LLM with Lu Xun's internal ideation and writing style. To optimize learning across these tasks, we introduce a CharLoRA parameter updating mechanism, where a general linguistic style expert collaborates with other task-specific experts to better study both the language style and the understanding of deeper thoughts. We evaluate CharacterBot on three tasks for linguistic accuracy and opinion comprehension, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines on our adapted metrics. We hope that this work inspires future research on deep character persona simulation LLM.

Abstract: Generative models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive datasets can lead them to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information, raising ethical and privacy concerns. While some prior works have explored this issue in the context of LLMs, it presents a unique challenge for MLLMs due to the entangled nature of knowledge across modalities, making comprehensive unlearning more difficult. To address this challenge, we propose Modality Aware Neuron Unlearning (MANU), a novel unlearning framework for MLLMs designed to selectively clip neurons based on their relative importance to the targeted forget data, curated for different modalities. Specifically, MANU consists of two stages: important neuron selection and selective pruning. The first stage identifies and collects the most influential neurons across modalities relative to the targeted forget knowledge, while the second stage is dedicated to pruning those selected neurons. MANU effectively isolates and removes the neurons that contribute most to the forget data within each modality, while preserving the integrity of retained knowledge. Our experiments conducted across various MLLM architectures illustrate that MANU can achieve a more balanced and comprehensive unlearning in each modality without largely affecting the overall model utility.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is of great scientific and practical significance. Researchers typically employ process-supervised reward models (PRMs) to guide the reasoning process, effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, existing methods for constructing process supervision training data, such as manual annotation and per-step Monte Carlo estimation, are often costly or suffer from poor quality. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework called EpicPRM, which annotates each intermediate reasoning step based on its quantified contribution and uses an adaptive binary search algorithm to enhance both annotation precision and efficiency. Using this approach, we efficiently construct a high-quality process supervision training dataset named Epic50k, consisting of 50k annotated intermediate steps. Compared to other publicly available datasets, the PRM trained on Epic50k demonstrates significantly superior performance. Getting Epic50k at https://github.com/xiaolizh1/EpicPRM.

Abstract: In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with first-order methods like back-propagation is computationally intensive. Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimisation uses function evaluations instead of gradients, reducing memory usage, but suffers from slow convergence in high-dimensional models. As a result, ZO research in LLMs has mostly focused on classification, overlooking more complex generative tasks. In this paper, we introduce ZOPrO, a novel ZO algorithm designed for Preference Optimisation in LLMs. We begin by analysing the interplay between policy and reward models during traditional (first-order) Preference Optimisation, uncovering patterns in their relative updates. Guided by these insights, we adapt Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) with a targeted sampling strategy to accelerate convergence. Through experiments on summarisation, machine translation, and conversational assistants, we demonstrate that our method consistently enhances reward signals while achieving convergence times comparable to first-order methods. While it falls short of some state-of-the-art methods, our work is the first to apply Zeroth-Order methods to Preference Optimisation in LLMs, going beyond classification tasks and paving the way for a largely unexplored research direction.

Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative to develop specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 models spanning five open-source LLM frameworks -- Mistral, Qwen, Llama, Phi, and Gemma -- ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1B to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance in O-RAN-specific tasks. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents -- a Mistral-based Question Generator and a Qwen-based Answer Generator -- to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack.

Abstract: Political advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and influencing electoral outcomes, often through subtle persuasive techniques embedded in broader propaganda strategies. Detecting these persuasive elements is crucial for enhancing voter awareness and ensuring transparency in democratic processes. This paper presents an integrated approach that bridges model development and real-world application through two interconnected studies. First, we introduce a lightweight model for persuasive text detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance in Subtask 3 of SemEval 2023 Task 3 while requiring significantly fewer computational resources and training data than existing methods. Second, we demonstrate the model's practical utility by collecting the Australian Federal Election 2022 Facebook Ads (APA22) dataset, partially annotating a subset for persuasion, and fine-tuning the model to adapt from mainstream news to social media content. We then apply the fine-tuned model to label the remainder of the APA22 dataset, revealing distinct patterns in how political campaigns leverage persuasion through different funding strategies, word choices, demographic targeting, and temporal shifts in persuasion intensity as election day approaches. Our findings not only underscore the necessity of domain-specific modeling for analyzing persuasion on social media but also show how uncovering these strategies can enhance transparency, inform voters, and promote accountability in digital campaigns.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a crucial role in this progress. While "aha moment" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$73.4 % on MathVista, 62.9 %$\rightarrow$70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/RL-with-Cold-Start.

Abstract: Recent advancements in adversarial jailbreak attacks have exposed critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the circumvention of alignment safeguards through increasingly sophisticated prompt manipulations. Based on our experiments, we found that the effectiveness of jailbreak strategies is influenced by the comprehension ability of the attacked LLM. Building on this insight, we propose a capability-aware Multi-Encryption Framework (MEF) for evaluating vulnerabilities in black-box LLMs. Specifically, MEF first categorizes the comprehension ability level of the LLM, then applies different strategies accordingly: For models with limited comprehension ability, MEF adopts the Fu+En1 strategy, which integrates layered semantic mutations with an encryption technique, more effectively contributing to evasion of the LLM's defenses at the input and inference stages. For models with strong comprehension ability, MEF uses a more complex Fu+En1+En2 strategy, in which additional dual-ended encryption techniques are applied to the LLM's responses, further contributing to evasion of the LLM's defenses at the output stage. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates of 98.9% on GPT-4o (29 May 2025 release) and 99.8% on GPT-4.1 (8 July 2025 release). Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities in current LLM alignment mechanisms.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM), a critical subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP), focuses on extracting argumentative structures from text. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed AM, enabling advanced in-context learning, prompt-based generation, and robust cross-domain adaptability. This survey systematically synthesizes recent advancements in LLM-driven AM. We provide a concise review of foundational theories and annotation frameworks, alongside a meticulously curated catalog of datasets. A key contribution is our comprehensive taxonomy of AM subtasks, elucidating how contemporary LLM techniques -- such as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and retrieval augmentation -- have reconfigured their execution. We further detail current LLM architectures and methodologies, critically assess evaluation practices, and delineate pivotal challenges including long-context reasoning, interpretability, and annotation bottlenecks. Conclusively, we highlight emerging trends and propose a forward-looking research agenda for LLM-based computational argumentation, aiming to strategically guide researchers in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Effectively engaging the public with science is vital for fostering trust and understanding in our scientific community. Yet, with an ever-growing volume of information, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will perceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions, such as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework, we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final engagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive significantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different scientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently. Overall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception modeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public interest and engagement with scientific content.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs), yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs. GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident, one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is available at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP.

<title>Fairness Evaluation of Large Language Models in Academic Library Reference Services</title>

arXiv:2507.04224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably, regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies, reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic library reference services.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) turn writing into a live exchange between humans and software. We characterize this new medium as a discursive network that treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements circulate. We define the generation of erroneous information as invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. We develop a general mathematical model of discursive networks that shows that a network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmonizer merges their verdicts. We identify an ethical transgression, epithesis, that occurs when humans fail to engage in the discursive network. The takeaway is practical and cultural: reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from connecting imperfect ones into networks that enforce mutual accountability.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been extensively explored in large models to tackle complex understanding tasks. However, it still remains an open question whether such strategies can be applied to verifying and reinforcing image generation scenarios. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image generation. PARM adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models, and PARM++ further introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct the generated unsatisfactory image, which is the first to incorporate reflection in autoregressive image generation. Using our investigated reasoning strategies, we enhance a baseline model, Show-o, to achieve superior results, with a significant +24% improvement on the GenEval benchmark, surpassing Stable Diffusion 3 by +15%. We hope our study provides unique insights and paves a new path for integrating CoT reasoning with autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Research is a fundamental process driving the advancement of human civilization, yet it demands substantial time and effort from researchers. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has inspired researchers to explore how AI can accelerate and enhance research. To monitor relevant advancements, this paper presents a systematic review of the progress in this domain. Specifically, we organize the relevant studies into three main categories: hypothesis formulation, hypothesis validation, and manuscript publication. Hypothesis formulation involves knowledge synthesis and hypothesis generation. Hypothesis validation includes the verification of scientific claims, theorem proving, and experiment validation. Manuscript publication encompasses manuscript writing and the peer review process. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the current challenges faced in these areas, as well as potential future directions for research. Finally, we also offer a comprehensive overview of existing benchmarks and tools across various domains that support the integration of AI into the research process. We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and fosters future research. Resources have been made publicly available at https://github.com/zkzhou126/AI-for-Research.

Abstract: We introduce OpenVLThinker, one of the first open-source large vision-language models (LVLMs) to exhibit sophisticated chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving notable performance gains on challenging visual reasoning tasks. While text-based reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek R1) show promising results in text-only tasks, distilling their reasoning into LVLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in performance degradation due to imprecise visual grounding. Conversely, purely reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods face a large search space, hindering the emergence of reflective behaviors in smaller models (e.g., 7B LVLMs). Surprisingly, alternating between SFT and RL ultimately results in significant performance improvements after a few iterations. Our analysis reveals that the base model rarely exhibits reasoning behaviors initially, but SFT effectively surfaces these latent actions and narrows the RL search space, accelerating the development of reasoning capabilities. Each subsequent RL stage further refines the model's reasoning skills, producing higher-quality SFT data for continued self-improvement. OpenVLThinker-7B consistently advances performance across six benchmarks demanding mathematical and general reasoning, notably improving MathVista by 3.8%, EMMA by 2.4%, and HallusionBench by 1.6%. Beyond demonstrating the synergy between SFT and RL for complex reasoning tasks, our findings provide early evidence towards achieving R1-style reasoning in multimodal contexts.

Abstract: Recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems face a common dilemma: autoregressive (AR) models suffer from slow generation and lack duration controllability, while non-autoregressive (NAR) models lack temporal modeling and typically require complex designs. In this paper, we introduce a novel pseudo-autoregressive (PAR) codec language modeling approach that unifies AR and NAR modeling. Combining explicit temporal modeling from AR with parallel generation from NAR, PAR generates dynamic-length spans at fixed time steps. Building on PAR, we propose PALLE, a two-stage TTS system that leverages PAR for initial generation followed by NAR refinement. In the first stage, PAR progressively generates speech tokens along the time dimension, with each step predicting all positions in parallel but only retaining the left-most span. In the second stage, low-confidence tokens are iteratively refined in parallel, leveraging the global contextual information.Experiments demonstrate that PALLE, trained on LibriTTS, outperforms state-of-the-art systems trained on large-scale data, including F5-TTS, E2-TTS, and MaskGCT, on the LibriSpeech test-clean set in terms of speech quality, speaker similarity, and intelligibility, while achieving up to ten times faster inference speed.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code has been released in https://github.com/microsoft/DeepVideoDiscovery.

<title>LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are facing the challenges of understanding and following multimodal assembly instructions, particularly when fine-grained spatial reasoning and precise object state detection are required. In this work, we explore LEGO Co-builder, a hybrid benchmark combining real-world LEGO assembly logic with programmatically generated multimodal scenes. The dataset captures stepwise visual states and procedural instructions, allowing controlled evaluation of instruction-following, object detection, and state detection. We introduce a unified framework and assess leading VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen-VL, under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Our results reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, with a maximum F1 score of just 40.54\% on state detection, highlighting gaps in fine-grained visual understanding. We release the benchmark, codebase, and generation pipeline to support future research on multimodal assembly assistants grounded in real-world workflows.

Abstract: We present the DEREK (Deep Extraction & Reasoning Engine for Knowledge) Module, a secure and scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline designed specifically for enterprise document question answering. Designed and implemented by eSapiens, the system ingests heterogeneous content (PDF, Office, web), splits it into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, and indexes them in a hybrid HNSW+BM25 store. User queries are refined by GPT-4o, retrieved via combined vector+BM25 search, reranked with Cohere, and answered by an LLM using CO-STAR prompt engineering. A LangGraph verifier enforces citation overlap, regenerating answers until every claim is grounded. On four LegalBench subsets, 1000-token chunks improve Recall@50 by approximately 1 pp and hybrid+rerank boosts Precision@10 by approximately 7 pp; the verifier raises TRACe Utilization above 0.50 and limits unsupported statements to less than 3%. All components run in containers, enforce end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256. These results demonstrate that the DEREK module delivers accurate, traceable, and production-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead. The module is designed to meet enterprise demands for secure, auditable, and context-faithful retrieval, providing a reliable baseline for high-stakes domains such as legal and finance.

<div> demonstration learning, named entity recognition, low-resource scenarios, dual similarity, adversarial demonstration<br />
Summary:<br />
The study addresses named entity recognition (NER) in low-resource scenarios using demonstration learning. Two key issues are identified: selection of demonstration examples and the NER tagger's ability to reference them. The proposed method addresses these issues by utilizing dual similarity for example selection, combining semantic and feature similarity. Additionally, an adversarial demonstration approach is introduced to train the NER model, forcing it to reference demonstrations during tagging. Comprehensive experiments in low-resource NER tasks show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches. <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of named entity recognition (NER) based on demonstration learning in low-resource scenarios. We identify two issues in demonstration construction and model training. Firstly, existing methods for selecting demonstration examples primarily rely on semantic similarity; We show that feature similarity can provide significant performance improvement. Secondly, we show that the NER tagger's ability to reference demonstration examples is generally inadequate. We propose a demonstration and training approach that effectively addresses these issues. For the first issue, we propose to select examples by dual similarity, which comprises both semantic similarity and feature similarity. For the second issue, we propose to train an NER model with adversarial demonstration such that the model is forced to refer to the demonstrations when performing the tagging task. We conduct comprehensive experiments in low-resource NER tasks, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms a range of methods.

<div> underspecification, lexical flip, jargon inflation, Large language models, robustness

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are now capable of writing code in sensitive settings, but there is a need to test their sensitivity to prompt perturbations. Through experiments with 50 LeetCode problems and three types of perturbations (progressive underspecification, lexical flip, jargon inflation), researchers found that LLMs exhibit over-robustness to underspecification but lack sensitivity to changes in the prompt, such as a quantifier flip. Reasoning-tuned variants of LLMs were also observed to be less sensitive than their base models. The models often treat both harmless noise and meaningful changes as ignorable, highlighting the need for differential sensitivity in evaluation and training protocols. It is suggested to reward models that maintain stability under benign noise but adapt appropriately when there are significant semantic changes. <div>
arXiv:2507.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now write code in settings where misreading a single word can break safety or cost money, yet we still expect them to overlook stray typos. To probe where useful robustness ends and harmful insensitivity begins, we compile 50 LeetCode problems and craft three minimal prompt perturbations that should vary in importance: (i) progressive underspecification deleting 10 % of words per step; (ii) lexical flip swapping a pivotal quantifier ("max" to "min"); and (iii) jargon inflation replacing a common noun with an obscure technical synonym. Six frontier models, including three "reasoning-tuned" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they reused the baseline solution or adapted. Among 11 853 generations we observe a sharp double asymmetry. Models remain correct in 85 % of cases even after 90 % of the prompt is missing, showing over-robustness to underspecification, yet only 54 % react to a single quantifier flip that reverses the task, with reasoning-tuned variants even less sensitive than their bases. Jargon edits lie in between, passing through 56 %. Current LLMs thus blur the line between harmless noise and meaning - changing edits, often treating both as ignorable. Masking salient anchors such as function names can force re - evaluation. We advocate evaluation and training protocols that reward differential sensitivity: stay steady under benign noise but adapt - or refuse - when semantics truly change.

<div> Keywords: Named Entity Recognition, Hindi, Pretrained Models, Data Augmentation, Language Models

Summary: 
This study focuses on improving Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Hindi using pretrained encoders such as MuRIL and XLM-R, along with Generative Models like Llama2-7B and GPT3.5-turbo. Data augmentation from external sources like Wikipedia is also employed. Results show that incorporating Retrieval Augmentation (RA) significantly enhances NER performance, especially for low-context data. The macro F1 scores for MuRIL and XLM-R improve with RA, while Llama2-7B outperforms its baseline version by a considerable margin. Generative models like GPT3.5-turbo benefit from augmented data as well. However, Llama2-70B and llama3-70B did not show improvement with RA. This study provides valuable insights into effectively utilizing data augmentation methods and pretrained models to enhance NER performance, particularly in languages with limited resources. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: One major challenge in natural language processing is named entity recognition (NER), which identifies and categorises named entities in textual input. In order to improve NER, this study investigates a Hindi NER technique that makes use of Hindi-specific pretrained encoders (MuRIL and XLM-R) and Generative Models ( Llama-2-7B-chat-hf (Llama2-7B), Llama-2-70B-chat-hf (Llama2-70B), Llama-3-70B-Instruct (Llama3-70B) and GPT3.5-turbo), and augments the data with retrieved data from external relevant contexts, notably from Wikipedia. We have fine-tuned MuRIL, XLM-R and Llama2-7B with and without RA. However, Llama2-70B, lama3-70B and GPT3.5-turbo are utilised for few-shot NER generation. Our investigation shows that the mentioned language models (LMs) with Retrieval Augmentation (RA) outperform baseline methods that don't incorporate RA in most cases. The macro F1 scores for MuRIL and XLM-R are 0.69 and 0.495, respectively, without RA and increase to 0.70 and 0.71, respectively, in the presence of RA. Fine-tuned Llama2-7B outperforms Llama2-7B by a significant margin. On the other hand the generative models which are not fine-tuned also perform better with augmented data. GPT3.5-turbo adopted RA well; however, Llama2-70B and llama3-70B did not adopt RA with our retrieval context. The findings show that RA significantly improves performance, especially for low-context data. This study adds significant knowledge about how best to use data augmentation methods and pretrained models to enhance NER performance, particularly in languages with limited resources.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, self-attention layer, MLP, transformer block, context learning <br />
Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit the remarkable ability to learn new patterns in context at inference time without additional weight updates. The study demonstrates that stacking a self-attention layer with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) enables the transformer block to adjust the MLP weights implicitly based on the context. This mechanism potentially explains how LLMs can learn in context beyond training data. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, the study suggests that a transformer block can covert context into a low-rank weight update for the MLP layer. This implicit transformation mechanism sheds light on the mechanisms behind context learning in LLMs. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.16003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most striking features of Large Language Models (LLM) is their ability to learn in context. Namely at inference time an LLM is able to learn new patterns without any additional weight update when these patterns are presented in the form of examples in the prompt, even if these patterns were not seen during training. The mechanisms through which this can happen are still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why LLMs can learn in context and not only during training. Specifically, we show under mild simplifying assumptions how a transformer block implicitly transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of the MLP layer.

Summary:
Current LLMs show strong performance in providing writing feedback but face challenges in identifying major writing issues and determining when to give critical feedback. The study introduces a new task, dataset, and evaluation framework to assess LLMs' ability to support creative writers. A test set of 1,300 stories with intentional writing issues is used for controlled evaluation. Results indicate that while LLMs offer specific and mostly accurate feedback, they struggle to pinpoint the most significant writing problem in a story. Additionally, models have difficulty distinguishing when to provide critical feedback versus positive feedback. This research highlights the potential of LLMs in assisting writers but underscores the need for further development to enhance feedback accuracy and relevance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Can LLMs provide support to creative writers by giving meaningful writing feedback? In this paper, we explore the challenges and limitations of model-generated writing feedback by defining a new task, dataset, and evaluation frameworks. To study model performance in a controlled manner, we present a novel test set of 1,300 stories that we corrupted to intentionally introduce writing issues. We study the performance of commonly used LLMs in this task with both automatic and human evaluation metrics. Our analysis shows that current models have strong out-of-the-box behavior in many respects -- providing specific and mostly accurate writing feedback. However, models often fail to identify the biggest writing issue in the story and to correctly decide when to offer critical vs. positive feedback.

Summary:
mRAKL is a system developed for Multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction (mKGC) by reformulating the task as a Question Answering (QA) problem. Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, mRAKL predicts missing entities and links in knowledge graphs, focusing on low-resourced languages like Tigrinya and Amharic. The system utilizes a BM25 retriever and shows improved performance over a no-context setting. Experiments with higher-resourced languages like Arabic and English for cross-lingual transfer demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Ablation studies reveal that mRAKL can enhance accuracy significantly, achieving an improvement of 4.92 and 8.79 percentage points for Tigrinya and Amharic, respectively. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs represent real-world entities and the relationships between them. Multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction (mKGC) refers to the task of automatically constructing or predicting missing entities and links for knowledge graphs in a multilingual setting. In this work, we reformulate the mKGC task as a Question Answering (QA) task and introduce mRAKL: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system to perform mKGC. We achieve this by using the head entity and linking relation in a question, and having our model predict the tail entity as an answer. Our experiments focus primarily on two low-resourced languages: Tigrinya and Amharic. We experiment with using higher-resourced languages Arabic and English for cross-lingual transfer. With a BM25 retriever, we find that the RAG-based approach improves performance over a no-context setting. Further, our ablation studies show that with an idealized retrieval system, mRAKL improves accuracy by 4.92 and 8.79 percentage points for Tigrinya and Amharic, respectively.

Summary: 
In large organisations, knowledge sharing mainly occurs in meetings, creating a need for efficient documentation and retrieval processes. This study proposes using generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), to transcribe meetings and integrate various information sources for better accessibility. An end-to-end pipeline is implemented to automate meeting documentation, with genAI generating minutes and a chatbot interface for easy searching. Feedback from real-world usage highlights the potential benefits of reducing meeting workload with genAI assistance. While technical challenges are largely addressed, ethical considerations and organizational aspects are crucial for ethical implementation of such systems. Overall, the study emphasizes the role of genAI in improving knowledge management processes within engineering departments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large organisations, knowledge is mainly shared in meetings, which takes up significant amounts of work time. Additionally, frequent in-person meetings produce inconsistent documentation -- official minutes, personal notes, presentations may or may not exist. Shared information therefore becomes hard to retrieve outside of the meeting, necessitating lengthy updates and high-frequency meeting schedules.
  Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) models like Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit an impressive performance on spoken and written language processing. This motivates a practical usage of genAI for knowledge management in engineering departments: using genAI for transcribing meetings and integrating heterogeneous additional information sources into an easily usable format for ad-hoc searches.
  We implement an end-to-end pipeline to automate the entire meeting documentation workflow in a proof-of-concept state: meetings are recorded and minutes are created by genAI. These are further made easily searchable through a chatbot interface. The core of our work is to test this genAI-based software tooling in a real-world engineering department and collect extensive survey data on both ethical and technical aspects. Direct feedback from this real-world setup points out both opportunities and risks: a) users agree that the effort for meetings could be significantly reduced with the help of genAI models, b) technical aspects are largely solved already, c) organizational aspects are crucial for a successful ethical usage of such a system.

Summary: 
The Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR) is a novel framework designed to improve the performance of deep research agents in generating complex research reports. It introduces a draft-centric approach that allows for iterative refinement through a denoising process, informed by external information retrieval mechanisms. The framework incorporates a self-evolutionary algorithm to enhance the agentic workflow components, ensuring high-quality context generation. By treating research report generation as a diffusion process with an updatable skeleton draft, TTD-DR enables timely and coherent writing while reducing information loss during the search process. TTD-DR surpasses existing deep research agents in achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks requiring intensive search and multi-hop reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2507.16075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex, long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.

Summary:
The study examines how different persona prompt strategies influence simulations in large language models (LLMs) across various demographic groups. It highlights that LLMs struggle to simulate marginalized groups like nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern identities, but certain prompt strategies can improve portrayal. Interview-style prompts and name-based priming can reduce stereotyping and improve alignment in simulations. Surprisingly, smaller LLM models like OLMo-2-7B perform better than larger ones like Llama-3.3-70B. The findings provide actionable guidance for designing persona prompts in LLM-based simulation studies. <div>

Abstract: Persona prompting is increasingly used in large language models (LLMs) to simulate views of various sociodemographic groups. However, how a persona prompt is formulated can significantly affect outcomes, raising concerns about the fidelity of such simulations. Using five open-source LLMs, we systematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically role adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM simulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and closed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate marginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern identities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption strategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find that prompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help reduce stereotyping and improve alignment. Surprisingly, smaller models like OLMo-2-7B outperform larger ones such as Llama-3.3-70B. Our findings offer actionable guidance for designing sociodemographic persona prompts in LLM-based simulation studies.

Summary:
- The paper introduces the concept of adapter parameters for modifying machine learning model behavior, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI.
- The focus is on text-based compositional multi-tasking, where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously for each test example.
- A benchmark comprising four practical compositional tasks is proposed to facilitate research in this setting.
- The Learnable Calibration method is presented as a resource-efficient and high-performing solution tailored for on-device applications with limited computational resources.
- The contributions of the paper aim to advance the capabilities of LLMs in real-world multi-tasking scenarios, expanding their usability in complex, resource-constrained use cases.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapter parameters provide a mechanism to modify the behavior of machine learning models and have gained significant popularity in the context of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. These parameters can be merged to support multiple tasks via a process known as task merging. However, prior work on merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In this paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a long text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks concurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an efficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications, where computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions that are both resource-efficient and high-performing. Our contributions lay the groundwork for advancing the capabilities of LLMs in real-world multi-tasking scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use cases.

arXiv:2507.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hate speech on digital platforms has become a growing concern globally, especially in linguistically diverse countries like Bangladesh, where regional dialects play a major role in everyday communication. Despite progress in hate speech detection for standard Bangla, Existing datasets and systems fail to address the informal and culturally rich expressions found in dialects such as Barishal, Noakhali, and Chittagong. This oversight results in limited detection capability and biased moderation, leaving large sections of harmful content unaccounted for. To address this gap, this study introduces BIDWESH, the first multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset, constructed by translating and annotating 9,183 instances from the BD-SHS corpus into three major regional dialects. Each entry was manually verified and labeled for hate presence, type (slander, gender, religion, call to violence), and target group (individual, male, female, group), ensuring linguistic and contextual accuracy. The resulting dataset provides a linguistically rich, balanced, and inclusive resource for advancing hate speech detection in Bangla. BIDWESH lays the groundwork for the development of dialect-sensitive NLP tools and contributes significantly to equitable and context-aware content moderation in low-resource language settings.

Summary: The study explores the Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a novel 'planning theory of mind' (PToM) task called MindGames. Human participants outperform an LLM (o1-preview) in the PToM task, indicating a gap in social reasoning abilities between humans and LLMs. The PToM task requires inferring an interlocutor's beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior, showcasing human's implicit causal model of other agents. In contrast, the LLM excels in a baseline condition with minimal mental state inferences, highlighting its strength in planning when given explicit preferences. These findings suggest that while LLMs may exhibit ToM abilities in spectatorial roles, human-like social reasoning involving strategic intervention on others' mental states remains a challenge for current LLM capabilities. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests Large Language Models (LLMs) display Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities. Most ToM experiments place participants in a spectatorial role, wherein they predict and interpret other agents' behavior. However, human ToM also contributes to dynamically planning action and strategically intervening on others' mental states. We present MindGames: a novel `planning theory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous evaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans significantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher; $p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model of other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's preferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline condition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state inferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already given someone's preferences). These results suggest a significant gap between human-like social reasoning and LLM abilities.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Unknown label, Vague Perception, reasoning limits, improvement

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label \emph{Unknown}, with evaluation focusing on honesty rather than the reason for these responses. The phenomenon of \emph{Vague Perception} involves cases where inputs are indeterminate or solvable yet unresolved by the model. A framework is introduced to quantify the proportion of \emph{Unknown} responses due to model incapacity and test if guided stimulation can lead to correct outcomes. By differentiating uncertainties, the method offers insight into LLM reasoning limits and potential for enhancement. The study evaluates LLM reasoning accuracy across models and employs various methods to improve accuracy based on a baseline framework. This research delves into the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers a fresh perspective on addressing the \emph{Vague Perception} issue. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label \emph{Unknown}, yet current evaluations focus almost exclusively on whether such answers are \emph{honest} rather than why they arise. This blurs two distinct cases: (i) an input that is genuinely indeterminate and (ii) a solvable problem that the model fails to resolve. We call this phenomenon \emph{Vague Perception}. And thus we introduce a framework that quantifies the proportion of \emph{Unknown} responses attributable to model incapacity and tests whether guided stimulation can convert them into either correct (\emph{Known}) or intrinsically indeterminate outcomes. By separating these sources of uncertainty, our method provides a clearer picture of LLM reasoning limits and their potential for improvement. As we get a theoretical accuracy of reasoning task on different LLMs, we apply different methods to test whether the model can reach the accuracy given a baseline framework. Our work is meaningful in exploring the true reasoning ability of LLMs and providing a new perspective on solving the \emph{Vague Perception} phenomenon.

Long-context large language models (LLMs) in the scope of in-context learning (ICL) can benefit from many-shot learning with multiple demonstrations in the input prompt. Random selection of demonstrations is common due to computational constraints and performance parity with other selection strategies. This study introduces two new strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL. The first method combines selected similar demonstrations with a larger set of random demonstrations, improving performance with minimal computational overhead. The second strategy replaces random demonstrations with centroids derived from test samples through k-means clustering, further enhancing performance. Experimental results with Gemini Pro and Flash on various datasets demonstrate that these strategies outperform random selection and match or surpass other selection approaches while supporting caching and reducing inference costs significantly. By adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria, a balance between performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL can be achieved. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

Abstract: Recently, AI agents are rapidly evolving in intelligence and widely used in professional research applications, such as STEM, software development, finance, etc. Among these AI agents, deep research agent is a key category as it can perform long-horizon tasks and solve problems of greater complexity. However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically and automatically investigate the capabilities of these research agents. Furthermore, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety. To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree based Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across 7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system that extracts the logic tree of the research outcome and uses it as the intermediate information to present a comprehensive, reliable and robust evaluation; (2) finance oriented that it covers 70 typical financial research questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of tasks in the domain.

Summary: 
In this study, the researchers propose a method to enhance large language models (LLMs) used in online math tutoring by incorporating a lower-dimensional latent state representation of the student and optimizing a long-term policy for high-level actions based on this representation. This approach aims to guide the student towards solving target math problems independently, in contrast to traditional turn-level preferences. The model developed is lightweight and requires fewer computational resources compared to previous methods. Experimental results show that these modifications in the LLM-based tutors lead to improved long-term outcomes in simulated tutoring tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) built on existing reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) frameworks typically optimize responses based on immediate turn-level human preferences. However, this approach falls short in multi-turn dialogue settings, such as online math tutoring. We propose a method to enhance LLM-based tutors by representing the dialogue history with a lower-dimensional latent state representation of a student and optimizing a long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on the latent state. The goal is to better align the tutor's behavior with the long-term objective of guiding the student towards solving a target math problem on their own. Our model is lightweight, requiring less computational resources than prior work of training the tutor policy end-to-end to directly output the tutor's next utterance. Our experiment results demonstrate that these modifications lead to improved long-term outcomes compared to prompting in LLM-simulated tutoring tasks.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are expected to extract explicit information from complex documents, but their paragraph-style answers are often disorganized. To address this issue, the Arranged and Organized Extraction Benchmark (AOE) has been introduced. AOE is a bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to comprehend fragmented documents and organize information into a table. Unlike traditional text-to-table tasks, AOE includes diverse tasks across different domains, requiring models to generate context-specific schemas. In an experiment with state-of-the-art LLMs, results showed even advanced models struggled. The benchmark is available for evaluation. <div>

Abstract: With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is an expectation that LLMs can effectively extract explicit information from complex real-world documents (e.g., papers, reports). However, most LLMs generate paragraph-style answers that are chaotic, disorganized, and untraceable. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Arranged and Organized Extraction Benchmark (AOE), a new bilingual benchmark with data and documents of varying lengths designed to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to comprehend fragmented documents and reconstruct isolated information into one organized table. Unlike conventional text-to-table tasks, which rely on fixed schema and narrow task domains, AOE includes 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains, requiring models to generate context-specific schema tailored to varied input queries. In the experiment, we evaluated both open-source and closed-source state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that even the most advanced models struggled significantly. The benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tianyumyum/AOE.

Abstract: The debate surrounding language identification has gained renewed attention in recent years, especially with the rapid evolution of AI-powered language models. However, the non-AI-based approaches to language identification have been overshadowed. This research explores a mathematical implementation of an algorithm for language determinism by leveraging monograms and bigrams frequency rankings derived from established linguistic research. The datasets used comprise texts varying in length, historical period, and genre, including short stories, fairy tales, and poems. Despite these variations, the method achieves over 80\% accuracy on texts shorter than 150 characters and reaches 100\% accuracy for longer texts and older writings. These results demonstrate that classical frequency-based approaches remain effective and scalable alternatives to AI-driven models for language detection.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces SpeLLM, a method to address the bottleneck of scaling LLM vocabulary by decoupling input and output vocabularies. SpeLLM predicts character-level strings through multiple output heads, each predicting a single character simultaneously. This allows for representation of a larger output space using smaller, independent linear heads. A self-distillation approach is presented for converting standard LLMs to SpeLLM. Experiment results with four pre-trained LLMs show competitive performance on downstream tasks with a 5.1% reduction in runtime on average. The approach offers a potential solution to reduce LLM costs while increasing support for underrepresented languages and domains.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Scaling LLM vocabulary is often used to reduce input sequence length and alleviate attention's quadratic cost. Yet, current LLM architectures impose a critical bottleneck to this procedure: the output projection layer scales linearly with vocabulary size, rendering substantial expansion impractical. We propose SpeLLM, a method that decouples input and output vocabularies by predicting character-level strings through multiple output heads. In SpeLLM, each of the $k$ linear heads predicts a single character simultaneously, enabling the model to represent a much larger output space using smaller, independent linear heads. We present a self-distillation approach for converting a standard LLM to a SpeLLM. Our experiments with four pre-trained LLMs show their SpeLLM variants achieve competitive performance on downstream tasks while reducing runtime by 5.1% on average across models. Our approach provides a potential avenue for reducing LLM costs, while increasing support for underrepresented languages and domains.

Summary:<br />
- Large language models trained with reinforcement learning struggle with reliable and scalable verification processes.
- Grounding models in formal systems like Dafny enables automatic and mathematically provable verification.
- Human-annotated priors for LLMs are time-consuming; using formal languages like Dafny can reduce the need for such priors.
- The study introduces DafnyComp, a benchmark for compositional formal programs, and demonstrates the efficacy of supervised fine-tuning and RL with regularization.
- The proposed approach surpasses proprietary models in generating syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code and outperforms baselines on the DafnyComp benchmark.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing informal language-based (e.g., human language) Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) face a significant challenge: their verification processes, which provide crucial training signals, are neither reliable nor scalable. In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g., Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models (e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.

Summary:
In this study, gender bias in German Large Language Models (LLMs) was evaluated using a benchmark dataset for Question Answering that measures bias in model predictions across various dimensions, including gender identity. The templates in the English dataset were machine-translated into German and manually reviewed and corrected for errors. Two subsets were created: one with group terms related to gender identity and another with group terms replaced by proper names. Evaluations of various LLMs used in German NLP on this dataset showed bias in all models, both aligning with and against social stereotypes. The study highlights the importance of manual revision when creating datasets for gender bias evaluation due to limitations in machine translation from English to German, especially concerning grammatical gender. <div>

Abstract: Within the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), fairness evaluation is often associated with the assessment of bias and reduction of associated harm. In this regard, the evaluation is usually carried out by using a benchmark dataset, for a task such as Question Answering, created for the measurement of bias in the model's predictions along various dimensions, including gender identity. In our work, we evaluate gender bias in German Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering by Parrish et al. (2022) as a reference. Specifically, the templates in the gender identity subset of this English dataset were machine translated into German. The errors in the machine translated templates were then manually reviewed and corrected with the help of a language expert. We find that manual revision of the translation is crucial when creating datasets for gender bias evaluation because of the limitations of machine translation from English to a language such as German with grammatical gender. Our final dataset is comprised of two subsets: Subset-I, which consists of group terms related to gender identity, and Subset-II, where group terms are replaced with proper names. We evaluate several LLMs used for German NLP on this newly created dataset and report the accuracy and bias scores. The results show that all models exhibit bias, both along and against existing social stereotypes.

Summary: <br />
Active learning (AL) aims to optimize training and reduce annotation costs by selecting informative samples. In few-shot scenarios, the empirical distribution often differs from the target distribution, leading to suboptimal decision boundaries. The proposed PromptAL framework leverages unlabeled data to align the empirical distribution with the target distribution, improving the decision boundary. It constructs sample-aware dynamic soft prompts to adjust the model's predictive distribution. PromptAL combines uncertainty estimation with global and local diversity to select high-quality samples representing the target distribution accurately. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that PromptAL outperforms nine baseline methods. The codebase for PromptAL is publicly available. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to optimize model training and reduce annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples for labeling. Typically, AL methods rely on the empirical distribution of labeled data to define the decision boundary and perform uncertainty or diversity estimation, subsequently identifying potential high-quality samples. In few-shot scenarios, the empirical distribution often diverges significantly from the target distribution, causing the decision boundary to shift away from its optimal position. However, existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in enhancing the empirical distribution to better align with the target distribution, resulting in a suboptimal decision boundary and the selection of samples that inadequately represent the target distribution. To address this, we propose a hybrid AL framework, termed \textbf{PromptAL} (Sample-Aware Dynamic Soft \textbf{Prompts} for Few-Shot \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}earning). This framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in aligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution, thereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first leverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that adjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently, based on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation with both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more accurately represent the target distribution. Experimental results on six in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets show that PromptAL achieves superior performance over nine baselines. Our codebase is openly accessible.

Assigning a persona to a language model influences the level of bias it displays. The study emphasizes the importance of ensuring safe and fair language models, given their widespread use. Cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in shaping biases, highlighting the need for attention to diverse contexts and languages.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains explicit statements of offensive stereotypes which might be upsetting.
  Language models are prone to exhibiting biases, further amplifying unfair and harmful stereotypes. Given the fast-growing popularity and wide application of these models, it is necessary to ensure safe and fair language models. As of recent considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language models, yet the majority of studies have focused only on English language. A Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset for measuring bias in Dutch language models is introduced. The resulting dataset consists of 1463 sentence pairs that cover bias in 9 categories, such as Sexual orientation, Gender and Disability. The sentence pairs are composed of contrasting sentences, where one of the sentences concerns disadvantaged groups and the other advantaged groups. Using the Dutch CrowS-Pairs dataset, we show that various language models, BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje and Mistral-7B exhibit substantial bias across the various bias categories. Using the English and French versions of the CrowS-Pairs dataset, bias was evaluated in English (BERT and RoBERTa) and French (FlauBERT and CamemBERT) language models, and it was shown that English models exhibit the most bias, whereas Dutch models the least amount of bias. Additionally, results also indicate that assigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits. These findings highlight the variability of bias across languages and contexts, suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in shaping model biases.

Summary: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to generate hallucinations poses challenges to their reliability. Existing methods for hallucination detection focus on static representations of hidden states, overlooking their dynamic evolution across layers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to generate hallucinations undermines their reliability. Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream), which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.

<div> Hierarchical text classification, HTC, pre-trained language models, PLMs, topic models <br />
<br />
Summary: 
Hierarchical text classification (HTC) involves categorizing text documents based on a structured class hierarchy. Recent approaches combine pre-trained language models (PLMs) and topic models to extract features for classification. This study explores the impact of using features from both models on HTC performance. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets reveal that incorporating topic model features generally leads to lower classification performance compared to using PLM features alone. This challenges the assumption that combining features from topic models is beneficial for text classification tasks. The approach involves passing extracted features through convolutional layers, combining their outputs, and using label-wise attention mechanisms to extract label-specific document representations. This study highlights the importance of carefully considering the choice of feature extractors for hierarchical text classification tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a natural language processing task which has the objective of categorising text documents into a set of classes from a predefined structured class hierarchy. Recent HTC approaches use various techniques to incorporate the hierarchical class structure information with the natural language understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, using topic models along with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an effective approach for multi-label text classification tasks. The rationale behind the combination of these feature extractor models is that the PLM captures the finer-grained contextual and semantic information while the topic model obtains high-level representations which consider the corpus of documents as a whole. In this paper, we use a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic model to extract features from text documents which are used to train a classification model. Our objective is to determine whether the combination of the features extracted from the two models is beneficial to HTC performance in general. In our approach, the extracted features are passed through separate convolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise attention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by weighing the most important features for each class separately. We perform comprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets and show that using the features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification performance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM. In contrast to previous work, this shows that the incorporation of features extracted from topic models for text classification tasks should not be assumed beneficial.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the Ever-Evolving Science Exam (EESE), a dynamic benchmark for evaluating the scientific understanding of foundation models. It addresses challenges such as data leakage risks and evaluation inefficiency by introducing a non-public EESE-Pool with over 100K expertly built science instances and a periodically updated 500-instance subset EESE. The EESE benchmark is designed to assess scientific capabilities across various disciplines and subfields, ensuring Range, Reach, and Rigor. Experiments show that EESE effectively identifies the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic measure of how well foundation models handle science questions.

Abstract: As foundation models grow rapidly in capability and deployment, evaluating their scientific understanding becomes increasingly critical. Existing science benchmarks have made progress towards broad **Range**, wide **Reach**, and high **Rigor**, yet they often face two major challenges: **data leakage risks** that compromise benchmarking validity, and **evaluation inefficiency** due to large-scale testing. To address these issues, we introduce the **Ever-Evolving Science Exam (EESE)**, a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two components: 1) a non-public **EESE-Pool** with over 100K expertly constructed science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+ subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring **Range**, **Reach**, and **Rigor**, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset **EESE**, sampled and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations. Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic measure of how well foundation models handle science questions.

Abstract: This preliminary study investigates the usefulness of sentence-level Quality Estimation (QE) in English-Chinese Machine Translation Post-Editing (MTPE), focusing on its impact on post-editing speed and student translators' perceptions. It also explores the interaction effects between QE and MT quality, as well as between QE and translation expertise. The findings reveal that QE significantly reduces post-editing time. The examined interaction effects were not significant, suggesting that QE consistently improves MTPE efficiency across medium- and high-quality MT outputs and among student translators with varying levels of expertise. In addition to indicating potentially problematic segments, QE serves multiple functions in MTPE, such as validating translators' evaluations of MT quality and enabling them to double-check translation outputs. However, interview data suggest that inaccurate QE may hinder post-editing processes. This research provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of QE, facilitating its more effective integration into MTPE workflows to enhance translators' productivity.

Summary: 
This thesis focuses on advancing the computational understanding and manipulation of text styles through three key pillars. Firstly, Text Style Transfer (TST) involves altering stylistic properties while preserving content. Secondly, Authorship Attribution (AA) aims to identify the author of a text based on stylistic fingerprints. Finally, Authorship Verification (AV) determines if two texts share the same authorship. The thesis addresses challenges in these areas by utilizing parameter-efficient adaptation of large language models (LLMs), contrasting disentanglement of stylistic features, and instruction-based fine-tuning for explainable verification. Through these approaches, the thesis aims to enhance the ability to control and analyze text styles, benefiting fields such as natural language processing and computational linguistics. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This thesis advances the computational understanding and manipulation of text styles through three interconnected pillars: (1) Text Style Transfer (TST), which alters stylistic properties (e.g., sentiment, formality) while preserving content; (2)Authorship Attribution (AA), identifying the author of a text via stylistic fingerprints; and (3) Authorship Verification (AV), determining whether two texts share the same authorship. We address critical challenges in these areas by leveraging parameter-efficient adaptation of large language models (LLMs), contrastive disentanglement of stylistic features, and instruction-based fine-tuning for explainable verification.

Abstract: In recent years, various methods have been proposed to evaluate gender bias in large language models (LLMs). A key challenge lies in the transferability of bias measurement methods initially developed for the English language when applied to other languages. This work aims to contribute to this research strand by presenting five German datasets for gender bias evaluation in LLMs. The datasets are grounded in well-established concepts of gender bias and are accessible through multiple methodologies. Our findings, reported for eight multilingual LLM models, reveal unique challenges associated with gender bias in German, including the ambiguous interpretation of male occupational terms and the influence of seemingly neutral nouns on gender perception. This work contributes to the understanding of gender bias in LLMs across languages and underscores the necessity for tailored evaluation frameworks.

Summary:
This paper evaluates state-of-the-art multimodal large language models on intuitive physics tasks using the GRASP and IntPhys 2 datasets. The assessment reveals that even the latest models struggle to differentiate physically plausible scenarios from implausible ones. A probing analysis of model embeddings uncovers a vision-language misalignment where information captured by vision encoders is not effectively utilized by the language model, leading to reasoning failures. The primary limitation in intuitive physics tasks lies in the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic information. Improving vision-language alignment is crucial for future development of multimodal large language models. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on intuitive physics tasks using the GRASP and IntPhys 2 datasets. We assess the open-source models InternVL 2.5, Qwen 2.5 VL, LLaVA-OneVision, and the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, finding that even the latest models struggle to reliably distinguish physically plausible from implausible scenarios. To go beyond performance metrics, we conduct a probing analysis of model embeddings, extracting intermediate representations at key processing stages to examine how well task-relevant information is preserved. Our results show that, depending on task difficulty, a critical vision-language misalignment can emerge: vision encoders successfully capture physical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by the language model, leading to failures in reasoning. This misalignment suggests that the primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not the vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic information. Our findings highlight vision-language alignment as a key area for improvement, offering insights for future MLLMs development.

<br />
Summary: In the realm of financial document auditing, AI-driven solutions have transformed the traditionally labor-intensive process. However, a significant limitation exists in verifying compliance with legal mandates. This paper investigates the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in regulatory compliance, comparing open-source Llama-2 and proprietary GPT models using custom datasets from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Germany. It finds that Llama-2 excels at detecting non-compliance but proprietary models like GPT-4 perform best in diverse scenarios, especially non-English contexts. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in improving the efficiency of auditing practices while underscoring the importance of considering model configurations and real-world applicability. <div>

Abstract: The auditing of financial documents, historically a labor-intensive process, stands on the precipice of transformation. AI-driven solutions have made inroads into streamlining this process by recommending pertinent text passages from financial reports to align with the legal requirements of accounting standards. However, a glaring limitation remains: these systems commonly fall short in verifying if the recommended excerpts indeed comply with the specific legal mandates. Hence, in this paper, we probe the efficiency of publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of regulatory compliance across different model configurations. We place particular emphasis on comparing cutting-edge open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, with their proprietary counterparts like OpenAI's GPT models. This comparative analysis leverages two custom datasets provided by our partner PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Germany. We find that the open-source Llama-2 70 billion model demonstrates outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance or true negative occurrences, beating all their proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless, proprietary models such as GPT-4 perform the best in a broad variety of scenarios, particularly in non-English contexts.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of phonological reasoning within text-based large language models (LLMs). Utilizing the PhonologyBench benchmark, we assess tasks like rhyme word generation, g2p conversion, and syllable counting. Our evaluations across 12 LLMs reveal that while few-shot learning offers inconsistent gains, the introduction of a novel Pedagogically-motivated Participatory Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) prompt, which is anchored in educational theories like scaffolding and discovery learning, consistently enhances performance. This method leverages structured guidance to activate latent phonological abilities, achieving up to 52% improvement and even surpassing human baselines in certain tasks. Future work could aim to optimize P-CoT prompts for specific models or explore their application across different linguistic domains.

<title>Self-Contradiction as Self-Improvement: Mitigating the Generation-Understanding Gap in MLLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: multimodal generation, self-contradiction, internal supervision, co-improvement effect, data quality check

Summary: Despite efforts to unify multimodal generation and understanding tasks, MLLMs exhibit self-contradiction, mainly due to weak generation aligning with prompts. Applying post-training methods with internal supervision improves generation and understanding by leveraging self-contradiction. Fine-tuning the generation branch leads to a co-improvement effect, enhancing detection of false positives and reducing prompt-misaligned generations. Aligned training dynamics between generation and understanding allow for improved detection of mismatches. There is a risk of co-degradation under poor supervision, necessitating data quality checks. Intrinsic metrics like Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement. A curriculum-based strategy that gradually introduces harder samples as the model improves leads to better unification and improved MLLM generation and understanding.

arXiv:2507.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite efforts to unify multimodal generation and understanding tasks in a single model, we show these MLLMs exhibit self-contradiction where generation produces images deemed misaligned with input prompts based on the model's own understanding. We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such self-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction mainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather than misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of leveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model understanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the generation-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g., SFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation and unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and understanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows improvements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously incorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned training dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced prompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the understanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of co-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is empirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics like Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement, which highlights the necessity of data quality check. Finally, we propose a curriculum-based strategy based on our findings that gradually introduces harder samples as the model improves, leading to better unification and improved MLLM generation and understanding.

<br />
Summary:
PICACO is a novel pluralistic method proposed to address the Instruction Bottleneck challenge in In-Context Alignment with Large Language Models (LLMs). It optimizes a meta-instruction to navigate multiple values and improve LLMs' understanding and alignment without the need for fine-tuning. By maximizing value correlation and reducing distractive noise, PICACO effectively elicits LLM responses that uphold diverse values. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of PICACO across various value sets, outperforming recent baselines and achieving a better balance among up to 8 distinct values. The approach shows promise in alleviating value tensions inherent in human values, enhancing LLM performance without post-training modifications.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment (ICA). However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs. tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses, theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise, resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs, outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance across up to 8 distinct values.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article discusses the limitations of current evaluation frameworks for agentic search and introduces RAVine, a new evaluation framework. RAVine focuses on multi-point queries and long-form answers to better reflect user intents. It also introduces an attributable ground truth construction strategy to improve the accuracy of evaluations. Additionally, RAVine evaluates the iterative process inherent to agentic search and considers factors of efficiency. The authors benchmark several models using RAVine and provide insights that can help advance the development of agentic search systems. The code and datasets for RAVine are available on GitHub at https://github.com/SwordFaith/RAVine. <div>
arXiv:2507.16725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic search, as a more autonomous and adaptive paradigm of retrieval augmentation, is driving the evolution of intelligent search systems. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic search. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often deviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations, leading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search. To address these limitations, we propose RAVine -- a Reality-Aligned eValuation framework for agentic LLMs with search. RAVine targets multi-point queries and long-form answers that better reflect user intents, and introduces an attributable ground truth construction strategy to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained evaluation. Moreover, RAVine examines model's interaction with search tools throughout the iterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency. We benchmark a series of models using RAVine and derive several insights, which we hope will contribute to advancing the development of agentic search systems. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SwordFaith/RAVine.

Summary:
- Discourse markers (DMs) such as 'but' play a crucial role in discourse coherence but can be ambiguous.
- The interaction mechanism between DMs and non-DM signals remains unclear.
- The study investigates the relationship between DM polysemy and co-occurrence of non-DM signals in English.
- Using the eRST framework, a graded definition of DM polysemy is proposed.
- Polysemous DMs are found to co-occur with more diverse non-DMs, influenced by genre.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.16748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discourse markers (DMs) like 'but' or 'then' are crucial for creating coherence in discourse, yet they are often replaced by or co-occur with non-DMs ('in the morning' can mean the same as 'then'), and both can be ambiguous ('since' can refer to time or cause). The interaction mechanism between such signals remains unclear but pivotal for their disambiguation. In this paper we investigate the relationship between DM polysemy and co-occurrence of non-DM signals in English, as well as the influence of genre on these patterns.
  Using the framework of eRST, we propose a graded definition of DM polysemy, and conduct correlation and regression analyses to examine whether polysemous DMs are accompanied by more numerous and diverse non-DM signals. Our findings reveal that while polysemous DMs do co-occur with more diverse non-DMs, the total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Moreover, genre plays a significant role in shaping DM-signal interactions.

The paper introduces the Thread Inference Model (TIM), a family of large language models designed for recursive and decompositional problem solving. TIM is supported by TIMRUN, an inference runtime that enables long-horizon structured reasoning beyond context limits. By modeling natural language as reasoning trees rather than linear sequences, TIM is able to support virtually unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single inference. The system maintains a working memory that retains key-value states of relevant context tokens, enabling efficient reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages during reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate high inference throughput and accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks, as well as effective handling of information retrieval challenges requiring long-horizon reasoning and multi-hop tool use. <div>

Abstract: To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck reasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM), a family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and TIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond context limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences. The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and multi-hop tool use.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Test-Time-Matching (TTM) framework for role-playing using large language models (LLMs). TTM aims to enhance immersion in specific roles by automatically decoupling a character's features into personality, memory, and linguistic style. It involves a three-stage generation pipeline for controlled role-playing without the need for training. TTM achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance by enabling seamless combinations of diverse linguistic styles and variations in personality and memory. Human assessment results show that the framework produces expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues. <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled role-playing language agents to demonstrate significant potential in various applications. However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles, particularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand, fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated with data collection and the computational resources required for training, thereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and linguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory. We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery. However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks, incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research.

Summary:
The article introduces the Rare Disease Mining Agents (RDMA) framework designed to identify rare disease patterns in Electronic Health Records (EHR). Current coding systems often fail to capture rare conditions, leading to vital information being buried in clinical notes. RDMA addresses this issue by connecting scattered clinical observations to suggest specific rare conditions, handling abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying contextual reasoning locally. This approach improves F1 performance by up to 30% and reduces inference costs significantly. By processing data locally on standard hardware, RDMA mitigates privacy concerns associated with cloud processing, enabling clinicians to access crucial rare disease information from EHR systems while avoiding privacy risks. The framework supports earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients and is available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect 1 in 10 Americans, yet standard ICD coding systems fail to capture these conditions in electronic health records (EHR), leaving crucial information buried in clinical notes. Current approaches struggle with medical abbreviations, miss implicit disease mentions, raise privacy concerns with cloud processing, and lack clinical reasoning abilities. We present Rare Disease Mining Agents (RDMA), a framework that mirrors how medical experts identify rare disease patterns in EHR. RDMA connects scattered clinical observations that together suggest specific rare conditions. By handling clinical abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware, RDMA reduces privacy risks while improving F1 performance by upwards of 30\% and decreasing inferences costs 10-fold. This approach helps clinicians avoid the privacy risk of using cloud services while accessing key rare disease information from EHR systems, supporting earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients.

Summary:
Our research addresses the challenge of understanding safety-critical driving scenarios by analyzing braking events in ADAS-equipped vehicles. We propose a novel framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and classify driving scenarios, bridging the gap between numerical signals and natural language descriptions. Our method includes dual-path scenario retrieval, supporting both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based retrieval for unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We curated scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset for evaluation and found that our approach outperforms rule-based baselines and generalizes well to OOD scenarios. This framework offers a more effective and generalized approach to identifying and understanding potential hazards on the road, particularly in complex urban settings where rule-based methods may fall short. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The growing number of ADAS-equipped vehicles has led to a dramatic increase in driving data, yet most of them capture routine driving behavior. Identifying and understanding safety-critical corner cases within this vast dataset remains a significant challenge. Braking events are particularly indicative of potentially hazardous situations, motivating the central question of our research: Why does a vehicle brake? Existing approaches primarily rely on rule-based heuristics to retrieve target scenarios using predefined condition filters. While effective in simple environments such as highways, these methods lack generalization in complex urban settings. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) for scenario understanding and reasoning. Our method bridges the gap between low-level numerical signals and natural language descriptions, enabling LLM to interpret and classify driving scenarios. We propose a dual-path scenario retrieval that supports both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate evaluation, we curate scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset. Experimental results show that our method outperforms rule-based baselines and generalizes well to OOD scenarios.

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 155 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.

<title>SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting</title>

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.

Abstract: The recent rise in youth suicide highlights the urgent need to understand how online experiences contribute to this public health issue. Our mixed-methods approach responds to this challenge by developing a set of themes focused on risk factors for suicide mortality in online spaces among youth ages 10-24, and a framework to model these themes at scale. Using 29,124 open text summaries of death investigations between 2013-2022, we conducted a thematic analysis to identify 12 types of online activities that were considered by investigators or next of kin to be relevant in contextualizing a given suicide death. We then develop a zero-shot learning framework to model these 12 themes at scale, and analyze variation in these themes by decedent characteristics and over time. Our work uncovers several online activities related to harm to self, harm to others, interpersonal interactions, activity levels online, and life events, which correspond to different phases of suicide risk from two prominent suicide theories. We find an association between these themes and decedent characteristics like age, means of death, and interpersonal problems, and many themes became more prevalent during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns. While digital spaces have taken some steps to address expressions of suicidality online, our work illustrates the opportunities for developing interventions related to less explicit indicators of suicide risk by combining suicide theories with computational research.

Abstract: WhatsApp tiplines, first launched in 2019 to combat misinformation, enable users to interact with fact-checkers to verify misleading content. This study analyzes 580 unique claims (tips) from 451 users, covering both high-resource languages (English, Hindi) and a low-resource language (Telugu) during the 2021 Indian assembly elections using a mixed-method approach. We categorize the claims into three categories, election, COVID-19, and others, and observe variations across languages. We compare content similarity through frequent word analysis and clustering of neural sentence embeddings. We also investigate user overlap across languages and fact-checking organizations. We measure the average time required to debunk claims and inform tipline users. Results reveal similarities in claims across languages, with some users submitting tips in multiple languages to the same fact-checkers. Fact-checkers generally require a couple of days to debunk a new claim and share the results with users. Notably, no user submits claims to multiple fact-checking organizations, indicating that each organization maintains a unique audience. We provide practical recommendations for using tiplines during elections with ethical consideration of users' information.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.16518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated, leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model, C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately. Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be released.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&amp;D, strategic deception and scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-$45^\circ$ Law," we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&amp;D risks. For self-replication, and strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth. While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations. First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm. Our design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields effective classification and discriminative state representations. We extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among small reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25, significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for long-context modeling.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely adopted in robotics to enable autonomous planning. However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet data, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents ExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of ExpTeach.

Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

<title>Steering Out-of-Distribution Generalization with Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to unintended out-of-distribution generalization. Standard approaches to this problem rely on modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks, including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions. Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall, CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without modifying training data.

<title>Beyond Binary Rewards: Training LMs to Reason About Their Uncertainty</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16806</link>

Abstract: When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to generate natural language "reasoning chains", their performance improves on a variety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction. We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning models.

<title>Modeling the Sacred: Considerations when Using Religious Texts in Natural Language Processing</title>

Abstract: This position paper concerns the use of religious texts in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is of special interest to the Ethics of NLP. Religious texts are expressions of culturally important values, and machine learned models have a propensity to reproduce cultural values encoded in their training data. Furthermore, translations of religious texts are frequently used by NLP researchers when language data is scarce. This repurposes the translations from their original uses and motivations, which often involve attracting new followers. This paper argues that NLP's use of such texts raises considerations that go beyond model biases, including data provenance, cultural contexts, and their use in proselytism. We argue for more consideration of researcher positionality, and of the perspectives of marginalized linguistic and religious communities.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Erasure of Language Memory (ELM), a principled approach to concept-level unlearning that operates by matching distributions defined by the model's own introspective classification capabilities. Our key insight is that effective unlearning should leverage the model's ability to evaluate its own knowledge, using the language model itself as a classifier to identify and reduce the likelihood of generating content related to undesired concepts. ELM applies this framework to create targeted low-rank updates that reduce generation probabilities for concept-specific content while preserving the model's broader capabilities. We demonstrate ELM's efficacy on biosecurity, cybersecurity, and literary domain erasure tasks. Comparative evaluation reveals that ELM-modified models achieve near-random performance on assessments targeting erased concepts, while simultaneously preserving generation coherence, maintaining benchmark performance on unrelated tasks, and exhibiting strong robustness to adversarial attacks. Our code, data, and trained models are available at https://elm.baulab.info

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the data preparation pipeline developed for the OpenGPT-X project, a large-scale initiative aimed at creating open and high-performance multilingual large language models (LLMs). The project goal is to deliver models that cover all major European languages, with a particular focus on real-world applications within the European Union. We explain all data processing steps, starting with the data selection and requirement definition to the preparation of the final filtered data. We distinguish between curated data and web data, as each of these categories is handled by distinct pipelines, with curated data undergoing minimal filtering and web data requiring extensive filtering and deduplication. This distinction guided the development of specialized algorithmic solutions for both pipelines. In addition to describing the processing methodologies, we provide an in-depth analysis of the datasets, increasing transparency and alignment with European data regulations. Finally, we share key insights and challenges faced during the project, offering recommendations for future endeavors in large-scale multilingual data preparation for LLMs.

<title>Atomic Calibration of LLMs in Long-Form Generations</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, posing significant challenges for real-world applications. Confidence calibration, which estimates the underlying uncertainty of model predictions, is essential to enhance the LLMs' trustworthiness. Existing research on LLM calibration has primarily focused on short-form tasks, providing a single confidence score at the response level (macro calibration). However, this approach is insufficient for long-form generations, where responses often contain more complex statements and may include both accurate and inaccurate information. Therefore, we introduce atomic calibration, a novel approach that evaluates factuality calibration at a fine-grained level by breaking down long responses into atomic claims. We classify confidence elicitation methods into discriminative and generative types and demonstrate that their combination can enhance calibration. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs and datasets show that atomic calibration is well-suited for long-form generation and can also improve macro calibration results. Additionally, atomic calibration reveals insightful patterns in LLM confidence throughout the generation process.

Abstract: This study explores computational approaches for measuring moral foundations (MFs) in non-English corpora. Since most resources are developed primarily for English, cross-linguistic applications of moral foundation theory remain limited. Using Chinese as a case study, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying English resources to machine translated text, local language lexicons, multilingual language models, and large language models (LLMs) in measuring MFs in non-English texts. The results indicate that machine translation and local lexicon approaches are insufficient for complex moral assessments, frequently resulting in a substantial loss of cultural information. In contrast, multilingual models and LLMs demonstrate reliable cross-language performance with transfer learning, with LLMs excelling in terms of data efficiency. Importantly, this study also underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation of automated MF assessment, as the most advanced models may overlook cultural nuances in cross-language measurements. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs for cross-language MF measurements and other complex multilingual deductive coding tasks.

Abstract: Model routing is a simple technique for reducing the inference cost of large language models (LLMs), wherein one maintains a pool of candidate LLMs, and learns to route each prompt to the smallest feasible LLM. Existing works focus on learning a router for a fixed pool of LLMs. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic routing, where new, previously unobserved LLMs are available at test time. We propose UniRoute, a new approach to this problem that relies on representing each LLM as a feature vector, derived based on predictions on a set of representative prompts. Based on this, we detail two effective instantiations of UniRoute, relying on cluster-based routing and a learned cluster map respectively. We show that these are estimates of a theoretically optimal routing rule, and quantify their errors via an excess risk bound. Experiments on a range of public benchmarks show the effectiveness of UniRoute in routing amongst more than 30 unseen LLMs.

Abstract: The application of role-playing large language models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding in both academic and commercial domains, driving an increasing demand for high-precision role-playing models. Simultaneously, the rapid advancement of reasoning techniques has continuously pushed the performance boundaries of LLMs. This intersection of practical role-playing demands and evolving reasoning capabilities raises an important research question: "Can reasoning techniques enhance the role-playing capabilities of LLMs?" To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study using 6 role-playing benchmarks, 24 LLMs, and 3 distinct role-playing strategies, comparing the effectiveness of direct zero-shot role-playing, role-playing with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and role-playing using reasoning-optimized LLMs. Our findings reveal that CoT may reduce role-playing performance, reasoning-optimized LLMs are unsuitable for role-playing, reasoning ability disrupts the role-playing scaling law, large models still lack proficiency in advanced role-playing, and Chinese role-playing performance surpasses English role-playing performance. Furthermore, based on extensive experimental results, we propose two promising future research directions: Role-aware CoT for improving role-playing LLMs and Reinforcement Learning for role-playing LLMs, aiming to enhance the adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness of role-playing LLMs for both research and real-world applications.

In this paper, we study empirically whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit the same behavior of conversational adaptation. We construct a corpus of conversations between LLMs and find that two LLM agents end up making more similar syntactic choices as conversations go on, confirming that modern LLMs adapt their language use to their conversational partners in at least a rudimentary way.

Abstract: Given the recent rate of progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, a tantalizing question is emerging: would robots controlled by emerging AI systems be strongly aligned with human values? In this work, we propose a scalable way to probe this question by generating a benchmark spanning the key moments in 824 major pieces of science fiction literature (movies, tv, novels and scientific books) where an agent (AI or robot) made critical decisions (good or bad). We use a state-of-the-art LLM's recollection of each key moment to generate questions in similar situations, the decisions made by the agent, and alternative decisions it could have made (good or bad). We then measure an approximation of how well models align with human values on a set of human-voted answers. We also generate rules that can be automatically improved via an amendment process in order to generate the first Sci-Fi inspired constitutions for promoting ethical behavior in AIs and robots in the real world. Our first finding is that modern LLMs paired with constitutions turn out to be well-aligned with human values (95.8%), contrary to unsettling decisions typically made in Sci-Fi (only 21.2% alignment). Secondly, we find that generated constitutions substantially increase alignment compared to the base model (79.4% to 95.8%), and show resilience to an adversarial prompt setting (23.3% to 92.3%). Additionally, we find that those constitutions are among the top performers on the ASIMOV Benchmark which is derived from real-world images and hospital injury reports. Sci-Fi-inspired constitutions are thus highly aligned and applicable in real-world situations. We release SciFi-Benchmark: a large-scale dataset to advance robot ethics and safety research. It comprises 9,056 questions and 53,384 answers generated through a novel LLM-introspection process, in addition to a smaller human-labeled evaluation set.

Abstract: This survey reviews how large language models (LLMs) are transforming synthetic training data generation in both natural language and code domains. By producing artificial but task-relevant examples, these models can significantly augment or even substitute for real-world datasets, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce, expensive, or sensitive. This paper surveys recent advances in leveraging LLMs to create synthetic text and code, highlighting key techniques such as prompt-based generation, retrieval-augmented pipelines, and iterative self-refinement. We examine how these methods can enrich low-resource tasks (e.g., classification, question answering) and facilitate code-centric applications (e.g., instruction tuning, code translation, bug repair) through automated verification of functional correctness. Alongside potential benefits - cost-effectiveness, broad coverage, and controllable diversity - we discuss the accompanying challenges, including factual inaccuracies in generated text, insufficient stylistic or distributional realism, and risks of bias amplification. Proposed mitigation strategies range from filtering and weighting synthetic outputs to reinforcement learning with execution feedback in code domains. We conclude by outlining open research directions, such as automated prompt engineering, cross-modal data synthesis, and robust evaluation frameworks, underscoring the growing importance of LLM-generated synthetic data in accelerating AI development while emphasizing ethical and quality safeguards.

Abstract: Addressing non-factoid question answering (NFQA) remains challenging due to its open-ended nature, diverse user intents, and need for multi-aspect reasoning. These characteristics often reveal the limitations of conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches. To overcome these challenges, we propose Typed-RAG, a framework for type-aware decomposition of non-factoid questions (NFQs) within the RAG paradigm. Specifically, Typed-RAG first classifies an NFQ into a predefined type (e.g., Debate, Experience, Comparison). It then decomposes the question into focused sub-queries, each focusing on a single aspect. This decomposition enhances both retrieval relevance and answer quality. By combining the results of these sub-queries, Typed-RAG produces more informative and contextually aligned responses. Additionally, we construct Wiki-NFQA, a benchmark dataset for NFQA covering a wide range of NFQ types. Experiments show that Typed-RAG consistently outperforms existing QA approaches based on LLMs or RAG methods, validating the effectiveness of type-aware decomposition for improving both retrieval quality and answer generation in NFQA. Our code and dataset are available on https://github.com/TeamNLP/Typed-RAG.

Abstract: Assisting LLMs with code generation improved their performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, the evaluation of code-assisted LLMs is generally restricted to execution correctness, lacking a rigorous evaluation of their generated programs. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs generated programs in response to math reasoning tasks, with a focus on evaluating the soundness of the underlying reasoning processes. For this purpose, we assess the generations of five LLMs, on several math datasets, both manually and automatically, and propose a taxonomy of generated programs based on their logical soundness. Our findings show that the capabilities of models significantly impact the logic implemented to solve the problem. Closed-source LLMs ground their programs in mathematical concepts, whereas open-source models often resort to unsound reasoning, relying on memorized information and exhaustive searches. Furthermore, increasing the difficulty of problems decreases sound generations for all models, revealing a critical shortcoming of LLMs on complex mathematics, contrary to what accuracy metrics suggest. Our work highlights the need for more holistic evaluations of code-assisted LLMs beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better understanding of LLMs' limits in the math domain.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT, their deployment in medical settings faces critical challenges including computational requirements and professional knowledge barriers. This paper presents an efficient lightweight medical large language model architecture that systematically addresses these challenges through three-dimensional optimization: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational enhancement. We design a knowledge transfer pipeline from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for precise medical knowledge retention. Through 4-bit quantization and mixed-precision strategies, we achieve substantial model compression while preserving medical reasoning capabilities. The inference framework incorporates Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching, complemented by specialized prompt templates for diverse medical queries. Experimental evaluation on medical benchmarks demonstrates that our approach maintains 92.1% accuracy on USMLE examinations while reducing memory consumption by 64.7% and inference latency by 12.4% compared to baseline models. This work provides a practical solution for deploying advanced language models in resource-constrained medical environments, enabling broader accessibility of AI-assisted healthcare.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) faces fundamental challenges in creating accurate annotations due to the inherent complexity of simultaneous manual and non-manual signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate generative large language models (LLMs) into SLR tasks. We propose a novel Generative Sign-description Prompts Multi-positive Contrastive learning (GSP-MC) method that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with domain-specific LLMs, incorporating multi-step prompt engineering and expert-validated sign language corpora to produce precise multipart descriptions. The GSP-MC method also employs a dual-encoder architecture to bidirectionally align hierarchical skeleton features with multiple text descriptions (global, synonym, and part level) through probabilistic matching. Our approach combines global and part-level losses, optimizing KL divergence to ensure robust alignment across all relevant text-skeleton pairs while capturing both sign-level semantics and detailed part dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance against existing methods on the Chinese SLR500 (reaching 97.1%) and Turkish AUTSL datasets (97.07% accuracy). The method's cross-lingual effectiveness highlight its potential for developing inclusive communication technologies.

Abstract: Hausa Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained increasing attention in recent years, yet remains understudied as a low-resource language despite having over 120 million first-language (L1) and 80 million second-language (L2) speakers worldwide. While significant advances have been made in high-resource languages, Hausa NLP faces persistent challenges, including limited open-source datasets and inadequate model representation. This paper presents an overview of the current state of Hausa NLP, systematically examining existing resources, research contributions, and gaps across fundamental NLP tasks: text classification, machine translation, named entity recognition, speech recognition, and question answering. We introduce HausaNLP (https://catalog.hausanlp.org), a curated catalog that aggregates datasets, tools, and research works to enhance accessibility and drive further development. Furthermore, we discuss challenges in integrating Hausa into large language models (LLMs), addressing issues of suboptimal tokenization and dialectal variation. Finally, we propose strategic research directions emphasizing dataset expansion, improved language modeling approaches, and strengthened community collaboration to advance Hausa NLP. Our work provides both a foundation for accelerating Hausa NLP progress and valuable insights for broader multilingual NLP research.

Abstract: With the increasing size of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), network pruning techniques aimed at compressing models for deployment in resource-constrained environments have garnered significant attention. However, we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on restoring safety in LVLMs post-pruning.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.

Abstract: Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With 1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on HumanEval compared to the baselines.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality evaluation datasets in low-resource languages to advance cross-lingual transfer. While cross-lingual transfer offers a key strategy for leveraging multilingual pretraining to expand language technologies to understudied and typologically diverse languages, its effectiveness is dependent on quality and suitable benchmarks. We release new sense-annotated datasets of sentences containing polysemous words, spanning ten low-resource languages across diverse language families and scripts. To facilitate dataset creation, the paper presents a demonstrably beneficial semi-automatic annotation method. The utility of the datasets is demonstrated through Word-in-Context (WiC) formatted experiments that evaluate transfer on these low-resource languages. Results highlight the importance of targeted dataset creation and evaluation for effective polysemy disambiguation in low-resource settings and transfer studies. The released datasets and code aim to support further research into fair, robust, and truly multilingual NLP.

Abstract: Speech is a noninvasive digital phenotype that can offer valuable insights into mental health conditions, but it is often treated as a single modality. In contrast, we propose the treatment of patient speech data as a trimodal multimedia data source for depression detection. This study explores the potential of large language model-based architectures for speech-based depression prediction in a multimodal regime that integrates speech-derived text, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers. Adolescent depression presents a significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional opportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by simultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances using the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis strategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the Depression Early Warning dataset. It achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%, which is higher than each of the unimodal, single-task, and non-longitudinal methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, especially when enhanced through collaborative communication. However, current methods often rely on a fixed number of agents and static communication structures, limiting their ability to adapt to varying task complexities. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Graph Pruning (AGP), a novel task-adaptive multi-agent collaboration framework that jointly optimizes agent quantity (hard-pruning) and communication topology (soft-pruning). Specifically, our method employs a two-stage training strategy: firstly, independently training soft-pruning networks for different agent quantities to determine optimal agent-quantity-specific complete graphs and positional masks across specific tasks; and then jointly optimizing hard-pruning and soft-pruning within a maximum complete graph to dynamically configure the number of agents and their communication topologies per task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is: (1) High-performing, achieving state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks and consistently generalizes across multiple mainstream LLM architectures, with a increase in performance of $2.58\%\sim 9.84\%$; (2) Task-adaptive, dynamically constructing optimized communication topologies tailored to specific tasks, with an extremely high performance in all three task categories (general reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation); (3) Token-economical, having fewer training steps and token consumption at the same time, with a decrease in token consumption of $90\%+$; and (4) Training-efficient, achieving high performance with very few training steps compared with other methods. The performance will surpass the existing baselines after about ten steps of training under six benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Digital twins are models of real-world systems that can simulate their dynamics in response to potential actions. In complex settings, the state and action variables, and available data and knowledge relevant to a system can constantly change, requiring digital twins to continuously update with these changes to remain relevant. Current approaches struggle in this regard, as they require fixed, well-defined modelling environments, and they cannot adapt to novel variables without re-designs, or incorporate new information without re-training. To address this, we frame digital twinning as an in-context learning problem using large language models, enabling seamless updates to the twin at inference time. We develop CALM-DT, a Context-Adaptive Language Model-based Digital Twin that can accurately simulate across diverse state-action spaces using in-context learning alone by utilising fine-tuned encoders for sample retrieval. We empirically demonstrate CALM-DT's competitive performance with existing digital twin approaches, and its unique ability to adapt to changes in its modelling environment without parameter updates.

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call this model Omni-router Transformer. Extensive experiments on a large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse, out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness to diverse data.

Abstract: Current AI agents cannot effectively learn from each other's problem-solving experiences or use past successes to guide self-reflection and error correction in new tasks. We introduce Agent KB, a shared knowledge base that captures both high-level problem-solving strategies and detailed execution lessons, enabling knowledge transfer across agent frameworks. Agent KB implements a novel teacher-student dual-phase retrieval mechanism where student agents retrieve workflow-level patterns for strategic guidance while teacher agents identify execution-level patterns for refinement. This hierarchical approach enables agents to break out of limited reasoning pathways by incorporating diverse strategies from external sources. Evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate substantial performance gains, with Agent KB improving success rates by up to 6.06 percentage points overall under pass@1. For SWE-bench code repair tasks, our system significantly improved resolution rates, with o3-mini achieving an 8.67 percentage point gain (23 percent to 31.67 percent) in pass@1. Our ablation studies demonstrate that the refinement module proves most critical, with its removal causing a 3.85% drop on challenging Level 3 tasks, highlighting that effective knowledge transfer necessitates both strategic guidance and execution-level refinement.

Abstract: AI scientists powered by large language models have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising, these agents also introduce novel vulnerabilities that require careful consideration for safety. However, there has been limited comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This perspective examines vulnerabilities in AI scientists, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse, and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing an overview of the potential risks inherent to AI scientists, taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential impact on the external environment. Then, we explore the underlying causes of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges associated with safeguarding AI scientists and advocate for the development of improved models, robust benchmarks, and comprehensive regulations.

Abstract: Compound AI applications chain together subcomponents such as generative language models, document retrievers, and embedding models. Applying traditional systems optimizations such as parallelism and pipelining in compound AI systems is difficult because each component has different constraints in terms of the granularity and type of data that it ingests. New data is often generated during intermediate computations, and text streams may be split into smaller, independent fragments (such as documents to sentences) which may then be re-aggregated at later parts of the computation. Due to this complexity, existing systems to serve compound AI queries do not fully take advantage of parallelism and pipelining opportunities. We present Alto, a framework that automatically optimizes execution of compound AI queries through streaming and parallelism. Bento introduces a new abstraction called nested ancestry, a metadata hierarchy that allows the system to correctly track partial outputs and aggregate data across the heterogeneous constraints of the components of compound AI applications. This metadata is automatically inferred from the programming model, allowing developers to express complex dataflow patterns without needing to reason manually about the details of routing and aggregation. Implementations of four applications in Alto outperform or match implementations in LangGraph, a popular existing AI programming framework. Alto implementations match or improve latency by between 10-30%.

<title>Exploring How Generative MLLMs Perceive More Than CLIP with the Same Vision Encoder</title>

arXiv:2411.05195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that CLIP models struggle with visual reasoning tasks that require grounding compositionality, understanding spatial relationships, or capturing fine-grained details. One natural hypothesis is that the CLIP vision encoder does not embed essential information for these tasks. However, we find that this is not always the case: The encoder gathers query-relevant visual information, while CLIP fails to extract it. In particular, we show that another branch of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieve significantly higher accuracy than CLIP in many of these tasks using the same vision encoder and weights, indicating that these Generative MLLMs perceive more -- as they extract and utilize visual information more effectively. We conduct a series of controlled experiments and reveal that their success is attributed to multiple key design choices, including patch tokens, position embeddings, and prompt-based weighting. On the other hand, enhancing the training data alone or applying a stronger text encoder does not suffice to solve the task, and additional text tokens offer little benefit. Interestingly, we find that fine-grained visual reasoning is not exclusive to generative models trained by an autoregressive loss: When converted into CLIP-like encoders by contrastive finetuning, these MLLMs still outperform CLIP under the same cosine similarity-based evaluation protocol. Our study highlights the importance of VLM architectural choices and suggests directions for improving the performance of CLIP-like contrastive VLMs.

Abstract: Recent years have seen the success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the domain of vision understanding. The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has been primarily driven by automatic data pipelines, which focus on the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our primary study approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and examining learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to that of baselines trained with significantly more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can enhance the performance of long video understanding without requiring training on long video data. The code and data examples are available at https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/Sparrow.

Abstract: Query rewrite is essential for optimizing SQL queries to improve their execution efficiency without changing their results. Traditionally, this task has been tackled through heuristic and learning-based methods, each with its limitations in terms of inferior quality and low robustness. Recent advancements in LLMs offer a new paradigm by leveraging their superior natural language and code comprehension abilities. Despite their potential, directly applying LLMs like GPT-4 has faced challenges due to problems such as hallucinations, where the model might generate inaccurate or irrelevant results. To address this, we propose R-Bot, an LLM-based query rewrite system with a systematic approach. We first design a multi-source rewrite evidence preparation pipeline to generate query rewrite evidences for guiding LLMs to avoid hallucinations. We then propose a hybrid structure-semantics retrieval method that combines structural and semantic analysis to retrieve the most relevant rewrite evidences for effectively answering an online query. We next propose a step-by-step LLM rewrite method that iteratively leverages the retrieved evidences to select and arrange rewrite rules with self-reflection. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets and widely used benchmarks, and demonstrate the superior performance of our system, R-Bot, surpassing state-of-the-art query rewrite methods. The R-Bot system has been deployed at Huawei and with real customers, and the results show that the proposed R-Bot system achieves lower query latency.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, which translates a natural language question into an SQL query, has advanced with in-context learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods show little improvement in performance compared to randomly chosen demonstrations, and significant performance drops when smaller LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) are used. This indicates that these methods heavily rely on the intrinsic capabilities of hyper-scaled LLMs, rather than effectively retrieving useful demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for effectively retrieving demonstrations and generating SQL queries. We construct a Deep Contextual Schema Link Graph, which contains key information and semantic relationship between a question and its database schema items. This graph-based structure enables effective representation of Text-to-SQL samples and retrieval of useful demonstrations for in-context learning. Experimental results on the Spider benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing consistent improvements in SQL generation performance and efficiency across both hyper-scaled LLMs and small LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/jjklle/DCG-SQL}{https://github.com/jjklle/DCG-SQL.

Abstract: Assessing student depression in sensitive environments like special education is challenging. Standardized questionnaires may not fully reflect students' true situations. Furthermore, automated methods often falter with rich student narratives, lacking the crucial, individualized insights stemming from teachers' empathetic connections with students. Existing methods often fail to address this ambiguity or effectively integrate educator understanding. To address these limitations by fostering a synergistic human-AI collaboration, this paper introduces Human Empathy as Encoder (HEAE), a novel, human-centered AI framework for transparent and socially responsible depression severity assessment. Our approach uniquely integrates student narrative text with a teacher-derived, 9-dimensional "Empathy Vector" (EV), its dimensions guided by the PHQ-9 framework,to explicitly translate tacit empathetic insight into a structured AI input enhancing rather than replacing human judgment. Rigorous experiments optimized the multimodal fusion, text representation, and classification architecture, achieving 82.74% accuracy for 7-level severity classification. This work demonstrates a path toward more responsible and ethical affective computing by structurally embedding human empathy

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various applications. However, their use as writing assistants in specialized domains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep domain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency across multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often degrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we introduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant that operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a novel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal retrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining information from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual elements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and professional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge representation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on financial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality, verifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and generated content quality.

Summary:
This study examines the interaction between fine-tuning objectives and model editing techniques in large language models (LLMs). The researchers find that edited knowledge is more prone to forgetting during fine-tuning compared to intrinsic knowledge acquired during pre-training. This highlights the limitations of current editing approaches and underscores the importance of evaluating edit robustness under downstream fine-tuning for practical deployment. The study also demonstrates that freezing layers associated with edited content can enhance knowledge retention, suggesting potential improvements for future editing methods. Overall, the research emphasizes the need for a comprehensive understanding of how fine-tuning affects edited knowledge in LLMs and offers insights into enhancing the robustness of model editing techniques for effective knowledge maintenance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training. In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further find that freezing layers associated with edited content can significantly improve knowledge retention, offering insight into how future editing methods might be made more robust.

<div> Keywords: open-source, LLMs, SMACS, multi-agent collaboration, performance

Summary:
This paper introduces SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system framework that leverages multiple open-source LLMs to outperform closed-source LLMs. The approach involves a Retrieval-based Prior Selection (RPS) method to select the top-performing LLMs for given questions and an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE) technique to generate diverse responses. Experimental results on eight benchmarks demonstrate that SMACS, integrating fifteen open-source LLMs, surpasses leading closed-source LLMs across multiple tasks, such as Claude-3.7-Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and GPT-o3-mini. The system achieves significant performance improvements, surpassing both open and closed-source LLMs, pushing the boundaries of intelligence. The code for SMACS will be available on GitHub for further exploration and adoption.

Summary: <br /><br />This paper presents SMACS, a framework that utilizes multiple open-source LLMs to surpass closed-source LLMs. The system employs RPS and EPE methods for LLM selection and response generation, achieving superior performance across various tasks. Experimental validations show SMACS outperforming leading closed-source LLMs such as Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1. The system significantly enhances intelligence limits by integrating multiple LLMs, exceeding both open and closed-source results.

Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and strengths of open-source collectives. It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple open-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this, we propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework with high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight mainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating fifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%) across multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results of different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source LLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence. Code will be released at https://github.com/magent4aci/SMACS.

<div> privacy policy, PoliAnalyzer, data usage practices, user preferences, NLP

Summary: 
PoliAnalyzer is introduced as a system to assist users with personalized privacy policy analysis by extracting data usage practices from policy texts using NLP. It compares user preferences with the formal privacy policy representation to produce a compliance report. Through an evaluation using the PolicyIE dataset, PoliAnalyzer showed high accuracy in identifying relevant data practices. It can model diverse user data-sharing preferences and analyze compliance against top websites, revealing common practices that violate user expectations. On average, 95.2% of privacy policy segments do not conflict with user preferences, reducing cognitive burden. The system can support automated personalized privacy policy analysis at scale, empowering individuals to regain control over their data and promote discussions on platform data practices for a fairer power dynamic. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites despite claiming otherwise. This paper introduces PoliAnalyzer, a neuro-symbolic system that assists users with personalized privacy policy analysis. PoliAnalyzer uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract formal representations of data usage practices from policy texts. In favor of deterministic, logical inference is applied to compare user preferences with the formal privacy policy representation and produce a compliance report. To achieve this, we extend an existing formal Data Terms of Use policy language to model privacy policies as app policies and user preferences as data policies. In our evaluation using our enriched PolicyIE dataset curated by legal experts, PoliAnalyzer demonstrated high accuracy in identifying relevant data usage practices, achieving F1-score of 90-100% across most tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how PoliAnalyzer can model diverse user data-sharing preferences, derived from prior research as 23 user profiles, and perform compliance analysis against the top 100 most-visited websites. This analysis revealed that, on average, 95.2% of a privacy policy's segments do not conflict with the analyzed user preferences, enabling users to concentrate on understanding the 4.8% (636 / 13205) that violates preferences, significantly reducing cognitive burden. Further, we identified common practices in privacy policies that violate user expectations - such as the sharing of location data with 3rd parties. This paper demonstrates that PoliAnalyzer can support automated personalized privacy policy analysis at scale using off-the-shelf NLP tools. This sheds light on a pathway to help individuals regain control over their data and encourage societal discussions on platform data practices to promote a fairer power dynamic.

Summary:
- The study explores the use of advanced natural language processing models to detect signs of bipolar disorder in social media text, aiming to address underdiagnosis and stigma.
- Evaluation of transformer-based models and LSTM models with different word embeddings on a dataset of Reddit posts shows RoBERTa performing the best.
- Contextualized language modeling, such as with RoBERTa, is crucial for accurate detection of bipolar disorder compared to static embeddings like GloVe and Word2Vec.
- LSTM models using BERT embeddings also show high performance, while those trained on static embeddings are ineffective.
- DistilBERT is highlighted as offering a good balance between efficiency and accuracy for model training, indicating its potential for mental health NLP applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness frequently underdiagnosed due to subtle early symptoms and social stigma. This paper explores the advanced natural language processing (NLP) models for recognizing signs of bipolar disorder based on user-generated social media text. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, ELECTRA, DistilBERT) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models based on contextualized (BERT) and static (GloVe, Word2Vec) word embeddings. Experiments were performed on a large, annotated dataset of Reddit posts after confirming their validity through sentiment variance and judgmental analysis. Our results demonstrate that RoBERTa achieves the highest performance among transformer models with an F1 score of ~98% while LSTM models using BERT embeddings yield nearly identical results. In contrast, LSTMs trained on static embeddings fail to capture meaningful patterns, scoring near-zero F1. These findings underscore the critical role of contextual language modeling in detecting bipolar disorder. In addition, we report model training times and highlight that DistilBERT offers an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy. In general, our study offers actionable insights for model selection in mental health NLP applications and validates the potential of contextualized language models to support early bipolar disorder screening.

<div> identity markers, bias, large language models, sensitive, applications

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in user-facing applications such as medical consultations, job interview advice, and more. Research shows that LLMs can infer identity information about the author from subtle linguistic patterns, affecting their decision-making in various high-stakes applications. The analysis reveals that LLM responses are biased based on markers of identity, with race, gender, and age consistently influencing outcomes. In medical applications, LLMs apply different standards of care based on ethnicity, while in political queries, responses align with conservative or liberal views based on the age of the user. Additionally, LLMs recommend lower salaries for non-White job applicants and higher salaries for women. These biases can lead to harmful differences in medical care, wage disparities, and distorted political realities. Tools for evaluating the impact of identity markers on model decisions are also provided. Thorough assessments before deploying LLMs in user-facing applications are recommended to address these serious implications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in user-facing applications, from providing medical consultations to job interview advice. Recent research suggests that these models are becoming increasingly proficient at inferring identity information about the author of a piece of text from linguistic patterns as subtle as the choice of a few words. However, little is known about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in real-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how identity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five different high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law, politics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are extremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race, gender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For instance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different standards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same symptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a conservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by older (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for non-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men. Taken together, these biases mean that the use of off-the-shelf LLMs for these applications may cause harmful differences in medical care, foster wage gaps, and create different political factual realities for people of different identities. Beyond providing an analysis, we also provide new tools for evaluating how subtle encoding of identity in users' language choices impacts model decisions. Given the serious implications of these findings, we recommend that similar thorough assessments of LLM use in user-facing applications are conducted before future deployment.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach, CCL-XCoT, for reducing hallucinations in Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs). The framework consists of two stages: enhancing cross-lingual semantic alignment through contrastive learning and next-token prediction, followed by a Chain-of-Thought prompting strategy during fine-tuning. CCL-XCoT significantly reduces hallucination rates by up to 62% and improves factual knowledge transfer across language pairs. The approach does not rely on external retrieval or multi-model ensembles, making it a promising solution to address hallucination issues in low-resource languages. <div>
arXiv:2507.14239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models(MLLMs) demonstrate strong generalization across languages, yet they remain prone to hallucinations, especially in low-resource languages, due to training data imbalances. These hallucinations, which include inaccurate or fabricated outputs, are particularly problematic in domain-specific generation tasks (Chataigner et al., 2024). To address this challenge, we propose CCL-XCoT(Curriculum-based Contrastive Learning-based Cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought), a two-stage fine-tuning framework for mitigating hallucination in MLLMs. Our approach first enhances cross-lingual semantic alignment through curriculum-based contrastive learning combined with next-token prediction during continued pre-training. Building on this foundation, we then introduce a cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought (XCoT) prompting strategy during instruction fine-tuning, which guides the model to reason in a high-resource language before generating answers in the target low-resource language. Experimental results show that CCL-XCoT reduces hallucination rates by up to 62% and substantially improves factual knowledge transfer across language pairs, without relying on external retrieval or multi-model ensembles.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, supply chain, graph analysis, dataset role, ecosystem evolution

Summary:<br /><br />Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly important in natural language processing tasks. The intricate LLM supply chain involves models and datasets, with relationships revealing key insights. Analyzing a large, sparse graph of 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges, it shows a power-law degree distribution. The core of the graph is densely connected, whereas the periphery is fragmented. Datasets play crucial roles in training LLMs, showcasing strong interdependence between models and datasets. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the graph with daily updates highlights the ongoing evolution of the ecosystem. Understanding these relationships is vital for detecting risks, ensuring fairness, and maintaining compliance in the development and deployment of advanced LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning to process and predict sequences of words from context, enabling them to perform various NLP tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation. However, the growing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying advanced LLMs require extensive computational resources and large datasets. This creates a barrier for users. As a result, platforms that host models and datasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular platforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no sign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained models, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand the origin and development of these components to better detect potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by this, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets, which are core components of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a method to systematically collect LLM supply chain data. Using this data, we build a directed heterogeneous graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, resulting in a structure with 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges. We then perform various analyses and uncover several findings, such as: (i) the LLM supply chain graph is large, sparse, and follows a power-law degree distribution; (ii) it features a densely connected core and a fragmented periphery; (iii) datasets play pivotal roles in training; (iv) strong interdependence exists between models and datasets; and (v) the graph is dynamic, with daily updates reflecting the ecosystem's ongoing evolution.

Abstract: Recent methods for customizing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) for domain-specific tasks have shown promising results in scientific chart comprehension. However, existing approaches face two major limitations: First, they rely on paired data from only a few chart types, limiting generalization to wide range of chart types. Secondly, they lack targeted pre-training for chart-data alignment, which hampers the model's understanding of underlying data. In this paper, we introduce ChartScope, an LVLM optimized for in-depth chart comprehension across diverse chart types. We propose an efficient data generation pipeline that synthesizes paired data for a wide range of chart types, along with a novel Dual-Path training strategy that enabling the model to succinctly capture essential data details while preserving robust reasoning capabilities by incorporating reasoning over the underlying data. Lastly, we establish ChartDQA, a new benchmark for evaluating not only question-answering at different levels but also underlying data understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that ChartScope significantly enhances comprehension on a wide range of chart types.

<div> translation, multilingual alignment, language models, low-resource languages, selective translation
<br />
Summary: 
This study explores the use of selective translation in improving multilingual alignment for large language models. Traditional translation techniques often struggle to accurately translate non-textual elements, such as code and mathematical expressions, leading to performance gaps in non-English languages. Selective translation focuses on translating only translatable parts while preserving non-translatable content and sentence structure. The study compares the effectiveness of selective translation against vanilla translation methods and examines the benefits of mixing translated samples with original English data during alignment. Experiments conducted on the low-resource language Hindi showcase the potential of selective translation, particularly with the use of Llama-3.1-405B translation model. This approach shows promise in enhancing the alignment of language models in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

LLMs exhibit advanced linguistic capabilities, yet their processing of temporal meaning in narratives diverges from human cognition. Through targeted experiments, it was found that LLMs rely heavily on prototypicality, have inconsistent aspectual judgments, and struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect. These results indicate a fundamental difference in how LLMs and humans process aspect, raising concerns about LLMs' narrative comprehension abilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit increasingly sophisticated linguistic capabilities, yet the extent to which these behaviors reflect human-like cognition versus advanced pattern recognition remains an open question. In this study, we investigate how LLMs process the temporal meaning of linguistic aspect in narratives that were previously used in human studies. Using an Expert-in-the-Loop probing pipeline, we conduct a series of targeted experiments to assess whether LLMs construct semantic representations and pragmatic inferences in a human-like manner. Our findings show that LLMs over-rely on prototypicality, produce inconsistent aspectual judgments, and struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect, raising concerns about their ability to fully comprehend narratives. These results suggest that LLMs process aspect fundamentally differently from humans and lack robust narrative understanding. Beyond these empirical findings, we develop a standardized experimental framework for the reliable assessment of LLMs' cognitive and linguistic capabilities.

<div> Keywords: clickbait detection, Croatian news headlines, BERT model, in-context learning, linguistic properties

Summary: 
Nearly half of Croatian news headlines analyzed in the study were identified as clickbait, demonstrating the prevalence of this practice in online media. The study introduced a new dataset, CLIC, for clickbait detection in Croatian news headlines, covering a wide range of outlets over a 20-year period. The study compared the performance of the fine-tuned BERTi\'c model to LLM-based in-context learning methods, finding that fine-tuned models provided superior results. The analysis of linguistic properties of clickbait headlines shed light on the characteristics that make these headlines attention-grabbing. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to detect and combat clickbait in digital media, highlighting the importance of contextual understanding and world knowledge in identifying sensationalized headlines. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online news outlets operate predominantly on an advertising-based revenue model, compelling journalists to create headlines that are often scandalous, intriguing, and provocative -- commonly referred to as clickbait. Automatic detection of clickbait headlines is essential for preserving information quality and reader trust in digital media and requires both contextual understanding and world knowledge. For this task, particularly in less-resourced languages, it remains unclear whether fine-tuned methods or in-context learning (ICL) yield better results. In this paper, we compile CLIC, a novel dataset for clickbait detection of Croatian news headlines spanning a 20-year period and encompassing mainstream and fringe outlets. We fine-tune the BERTi\'c model on this task and compare its performance to LLM-based ICL methods with prompts both in Croatian and English. Finally, we analyze the linguistic properties of clickbait. We find that nearly half of the analyzed headlines contain clickbait, and that finetuned models deliver better results than general LLMs.

- A real-world benchmark of 555 interviews with BFI-10 self-report scores was used to evaluate LLM-based personality inference.
- Three top LLMs were tested for BFI-10 item prediction and Big Five trait inference using zero-shot prompting.
- The models showed high test-retest reliability but limited construct validity, with weak correlations and low interrater agreement.
- Chain-of-thought prompting and longer input context slightly improved distributional alignment but not trait-level accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's LLaMA offer a promising approach for scalable personality assessment from open-ended language. However, inferring personality traits remains challenging, and earlier work often relied on synthetic data or social media text lacking psychometric validity. We introduce a real-world benchmark of 555 semi-structured interviews with BFI-10 self-report scores for evaluating LLM-based personality inference. Three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1 Mini, Meta-LLaMA, and DeepSeek) were tested using zero-shot prompting for BFI-10 item prediction and both zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting for Big Five trait inference. All models showed high test-retest reliability, but construct validity was limited: correlations with ground-truth scores were weak (max Pearson's $r = 0.27$), interrater agreement was low (Cohen's $\kappa < 0.10$), and predictions were biased toward moderate or high trait levels. Chain-of-thought prompting and longer input context modestly improved distributional alignment, but not trait-level accuracy. These results underscore limitations in current LLM-based personality inference and highlight the need for evidence-based development for psychological applications.

Abstract: The introduction of large language models has brought rapid progress on Text-to-SQL benchmarks, but it is not yet easy to build a working enterprise solution. In this paper, we present insights from building an internal chatbot that enables LinkedIn's product managers, engineers, and operations teams to self-serve data insights from a large, dynamic data lake. Our approach features three components. First, we construct a knowledge graph that captures up-to-date semantics by indexing database metadata, historical query logs, wikis, and code. We apply clustering to identify relevant tables for each team or product area. Second, we build a Text-to-SQL agent that retrieves and ranks context from the knowledge graph, writes a query, and automatically corrects hallucinations and syntax errors. Third, we build an interactive chatbot that supports various user intents, from data discovery to query writing to debugging, and displays responses in rich UI elements to encourage follow-up chats. Our chatbot has over 300 weekly users. Expert review shows that 53% of its responses are correct or close to correct on an internal benchmark set. Through ablation studies, we identify the most important knowledge graph and modeling components, offering a practical path for developing enterprise Text-to-SQL solutions.

Abstract: Relation Classification (RC) in biomedical texts is essential for constructing knowledge graphs and enabling applications such as drug repurposing and clinical decision-making. We propose an error-aware teacher--student framework that improves RC through structured guidance from a large language model (GPT-4o). Prediction failures from a baseline student model are analyzed by the teacher to classify error types, assign difficulty scores, and generate targeted remediations, including sentence rewrites and suggestions for KG-based enrichment. These enriched annotations are used to train a first student model via instruction tuning. This model then annotates a broader dataset with difficulty scores and remediation-enhanced inputs. A second student is subsequently trained via curriculum learning on this dataset, ordered by difficulty, to promote robust and progressive learning. We also construct a heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph from PubMed abstracts to support context-aware RC. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on 4 of 5 PPI datasets and the DDI dataset, while remaining competitive on ChemProt.

Summary:<br />
1. The study investigates the use of AudiBERT model to detect collaborative problem solving indicators from dialogue, showing statistically significant improvements over BERT model in social-cognitive classifications but not in affective ones.<br />
2. Results indicate that larger training data leads to higher recall performance for both models, and high inter-rater agreement among human coders is associated with higher precision of the BERT model.<br />
3. The BERT model's performance in diagnosing indicators well-detected by AudiBERT model was inconsistent, suggesting the need for a structured approach towards achieving human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks.<br />
4. The study emphasizes the importance of model explainability in supporting human agency and engagement in the reflective coding process, highlighting the role of human-AI collaboration in enhancing CPS diagnosis.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting collaborative problem solving (CPS) indicators from dialogue using machine learning techniques is a significant challenge for the field of AI in Education. Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to reliably detect meaningful CPS indicators. A notable advancement involved the multimodal BERT variant, AudiBERT, which integrates speech and acoustic-prosodic audio features to enhance CPS diagnosis. Although initial results demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of these enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on leveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop paper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not only improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset, but it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT model for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar significant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for classifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted that larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall performance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models. Additionally, the precision of the BERT model was significantly associated with high inter-rater agreement among human coders. When employing the BERT model to diagnose indicators within these subskills that were well-detected by the AudiBERT model, the performance across all indicators was inconsistent. We conclude the paper by outlining a structured approach towards achieving human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis, highlighting the crucial inclusion of model explainability to support human agency and engagement in the reflective coding process.

<div> BERT, model explainability, SHAP, collaborative problem solving, AI in Education

Summary:
The study explores the use of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to understand how tokenised words contribute to a BERT model's classification of collaborative problem solving (CPS). It highlights the importance of enhancing model transparency for better informing end users like teachers. The findings reveal that certain tokenised words have a significant impact on classifications, but not all explanations provided by the model are reasonable. Additionally, a spurious word was identified that positively influenced classification without semantic meaning. The study emphasizes the need for a balance between AI diagnostics and human expertise in CPS diagnosis. It argues for exploring ensemble model architectures and human-AI complementarity to improve fine-grained discrimination of CPS subskills. The extent of token usage in classification is linked to the number of classes involved, indicating the importance of considering both AI and human reasoning in CPS diagnostics. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model and its variants for classifying collaborative problem solving (CPS) has been extensively explored within the AI in Education community. However, limited attention has been given to understanding how individual tokenised words in the dataset contribute to the model's classification decisions. Enhancing the explainability of BERT-based CPS diagnostics is essential to better inform end users such as teachers, thereby fostering greater trust and facilitating wider adoption in education. This study undertook a preliminary step towards model transparency and explainability by using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to examine how different tokenised words in transcription data contributed to a BERT model's classification of CPS processes. The findings suggested that well-performing classifications did not necessarily equate to a reasonable explanation for the classification decisions. Particular tokenised words were used frequently to affect classifications. The analysis also identified a spurious word, which contributed positively to the classification but was not semantically meaningful to the class. While such model transparency is unlikely to be useful to an end user to improve their practice, it can help them not to overrely on LLM diagnostics and ignore their human expertise. We conclude the workshop paper by noting that the extent to which the model appropriately uses the tokens for its classification is associated with the number of classes involved. It calls for an investigation into the exploration of ensemble model architectures and the involvement of human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis, since considerable human reasoning is still required for fine-grained discrimination of CPS subskills.

Summary:<br /><br />This paper explores data augmentation methods for NLP tasks facing data scarcity and class imbalance. It investigates the use of large language models like GPT for traditional methods such as backtranslation and paraphrasing. Experimentation with ChatGPT on a sample dataset shows that backtranslation and paraphrasing can produce comparable or superior results to generative methods for data augmentation.

Abstract: Numerous domain-specific machine learning tasks struggle with data scarcity and class imbalance. This paper systematically explores data augmentation methods for NLP, particularly through large language models like GPT. The purpose of this paper is to examine and evaluate whether traditional methods such as paraphrasing and backtranslation can leverage a new generation of models to achieve comparable performance to purely generative methods. Methods aimed at solving the problem of data scarcity and utilizing ChatGPT were chosen, as well as an exemplary dataset. We conducted a series of experiments comparing four different approaches to data augmentation in multiple experimental setups. We then evaluated the results both in terms of the quality of generated data and its impact on classification performance. The key findings indicate that backtranslation and paraphrasing can yield comparable or even better results than zero and a few-shot generation of examples.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) hold promise for improving healthcare access in low-resource settings, but their effectiveness in African primary care remains underexplored. We present a methodology for creating a benchmark dataset and evaluation framework focused on Kenyan Level 2 and 3 clinical care. Our approach uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to ground clinical questions in Kenya's national guidelines, ensuring alignment with local standards. These guidelines were digitized, chunked, and indexed for semantic retrieval. Gemini Flash 2.0 Lite was then prompted with guideline excerpts to generate realistic clinical scenarios, multiple-choice questions, and rationale based answers in English and Swahili. Kenyan physicians co-created and refined the dataset, and a blinded expert review process ensured clinical accuracy, clarity, and cultural appropriateness. The resulting Alama Health QA dataset includes thousands of regulator-aligned question answer pairs across common outpatient conditions. Beyond accuracy, we introduce evaluation metrics that test clinical reasoning, safety, and adaptability such as rare case detection (Needle in the Haystack), stepwise logic (Decision Points), and contextual adaptability. Initial results reveal significant performance gaps when LLMs are applied to localized scenarios, consistent with findings that LLM accuracy is lower on African medical content than on US-based benchmarks. This work offers a replicable model for guideline-driven, dynamic benchmarking to support safe AI deployment in African health systems.

The study introduces a two-part affine approximation method for transformer computations in specific subject-object relations. Using the Bigger Analogy Test Set, it demonstrates the accuracy of the linear transformation Ws, derived from model derivatives, in reproducing final object states for various relations. The linear technique attains 90% faithfulness in morphological relations and exhibits comparable results across languages and models. This suggests that some conceptual relationships in language models, like morphology, are easily interpretable from latent space and are sparsely encoded through cross-layer linear transformations. <div>

Abstract: A two-part affine approximation has been found to be a good approximation for transformer computations over certain subject object relations. Adapting the Bigger Analogy Test Set, we show that the linear transformation Ws, where s is a middle layer representation of a subject token and W is derived from model derivatives, is also able to accurately reproduce final object states for many relations. This linear technique is able to achieve 90% faithfulness on morphological relations, and we show similar findings multi-lingually and across models. Our findings indicate that some conceptual relationships in language models, such as morphology, are readily interpretable from latent space, and are sparsely encoded by cross-layer linear transformations.

Summary: 
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various NLP tasks but still struggle with hallucinations, where they generate inaccurate responses.
- Detecting hallucinations is crucial for building safe and reliable LLMs, and uncertainty estimation is commonly used for this purpose.
- A new approach called Cleanse is proposed in this study, which quantifies uncertainty by measuring the intra-cluster consistency of LLM hidden embeddings.
- Cleanse employs clustering to identify inconsistencies in semantic information within LLM responses, helping differentiate correct from incorrect answers.
- The effectiveness of Cleanse is demonstrated using four different models and two question-answering benchmarks, SQuAD and CoQA. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) across various NLP tasks, hallucinations in LLMs--where LLMs generate inaccurate responses--remains as a critical problem as it can be directly connected to a crisis of building safe and reliable LLMs. Uncertainty estimation is primarily used to measure hallucination levels in LLM responses so that correct and incorrect answers can be distinguished clearly. This study proposes an effective uncertainty estimation approach, \textbf{Cl}ust\textbf{e}ring-based sem\textbf{an}tic con\textbf{s}ist\textbf{e}ncy (\textbf{Cleanse}). Cleanse quantifies the uncertainty with the proportion of the intra-cluster consistency in the total consistency between LLM hidden embeddings which contain adequate semantic information of generations, by employing clustering. The effectiveness of Cleanse for detecting hallucination is validated using four off-the-shelf models, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B and two question-answering benchmarks, SQuAD and CoQA.

A new Thai corpus called Mangosteen, consisting of 47 billion tokens, is introduced in this study. The corpus is built using a Thai-adapted Dolma pipeline that includes custom rule-based language identification, quality filters, and content filters specifically designed for the Thai language. By systematically ablations using GPT-2, the pipeline trims CommonCrawl documents while improving the SEA-HELM NLG score. An 8 billion-parameter SEA-LION model, pre-trained on Mangosteen, outperforms previous models on Thai benchmarks. The study releases the full pipeline code, cleaning manifests, corpus snapshot, and checkpoints, enabling reproducibility in Thai language model research and providing a solid foundation for future work in this area. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.14664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-training data shapes a language model's quality, but raw web text is noisy and demands careful cleaning. Existing large-scale corpora rely on English-centric or language-agnostic pipelines whose heuristics do not capture Thai script or cultural nuances, leaving risky material such as gambling content untreated. Prior Thai-specific efforts customize pipelines or build new ones, yet seldom release their data or document design choices, hindering reproducibility and raising the question of how to construct a transparent, high-quality Thai corpus. We introduce Mangosteen: a 47 billion-token Thai corpus built through a Thai-adapted Dolma pipeline that includes custom rule-based language ID, revised C4/Gopher quality filters, and Thai-trained content filters, plus curated non-web sources such as Wikipedia, Royal Gazette texts, OCR-extracted books, and CC-licensed YouTube subtitles. Systematic ablations using GPT-2 show the pipeline trims CommonCrawl from 202M to 25M documents while raising SEA-HELM NLG from 3 to 11; an 8B-parameter SEA-LION model continually pre-trained on Mangosteen then surpasses SEA-LION-v3 and Llama-3.1 by about four points on Thai benchmarks. We release the full pipeline code, cleaning manifests, corpus snapshot, and all checkpoints, providing a fully reproducible foundation for future Thai and regional LLM research.

Summary: Large language models (LLMs) were evaluated for assigning ICPC-2 codes to clinical expressions in Brazilian Portuguese using a semantic search engine. The study involved 437 annotated expressions and 33 LLMs, with top performers including gpt-4.5-preview, o3, and gemini-2.5-pro. Models achieved F1-scores >0.8, with some exceeding 0.85. Retriever optimization improved performance by up to 4 points. Most models returned valid codes with reduced hallucinations, but smaller models struggled with formatting and input length. The study concludes that LLMs show strong potential for automating ICPC-2 coding without fine-tuning but highlights the need for broader, multilingual evaluations. More extensive, end-to-end assessments are necessary for clinical validation.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Background: Medical coding structures healthcare data for research, quality monitoring, and policy. This study assesses the potential of large language models (LLMs) to assign ICPC-2 codes using the output of a domain-specific search engine.
  Methods: A dataset of 437 Brazilian Portuguese clinical expressions, each annotated with ICPC-2 codes, was used. A semantic search engine (OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large) retrieved candidates from 73,563 labeled concepts. Thirty-three LLMs were prompted with each query and retrieved results to select the best-matching ICPC-2 code. Performance was evaluated using F1-score, along with token usage, cost, response time, and format adherence.
  Results: Twenty-eight models achieved F1-score > 0.8; ten exceeded 0.85. Top performers included gpt-4.5-preview, o3, and gemini-2.5-pro. Retriever optimization can improve performance by up to 4 points. Most models returned valid codes in the expected format, with reduced hallucinations. Smaller models (<3B) struggled with formatting and input length.
  Conclusions: LLMs show strong potential for automating ICPC-2 coding, even without fine-tuning. This work offers a benchmark and highlights challenges, but findings are limited by dataset scope and setup. Broader, multilingual, end-to-end evaluations are needed for clinical validation.

Summary:<br />
- Large language models have advanced to reasoning across various domains, including mathematical reasoning, which requires precise logic and abstract reasoning applicable to other tasks.
- Closed-source reasoning language models like GPT-03 show impressive capabilities but lack transparency and reproducibility.
- The MiroMind-M1 series of open-source models based on the Qwen-2.5 backbone match or exceed the performance of existing open-source models.
- The models are trained in two stages: SFT on a curated corpus of math problems and RLVR on challenging problems, using an algorithm for efficient training.
- The models achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on benchmarks and are released along with datasets and configurations for reproducibility. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.14683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have recently evolved from fluent text generation to advanced reasoning across diverse domains, giving rise to reasoning language models. Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative benchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which can be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3 demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits transparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to close this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical resources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders reproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development, we introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on the Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing open-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a carefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT trajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To enhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates length-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage context-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B and 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate reproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K, MiroMind-M1-RL-62K); and all training and evaluation configurations. We hope these resources will support further research and foster community advancement.

Central to this process is the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub, organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation, and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3) Alignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness. Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption, recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing concrete recommendations for future efforts in post-training dataset development.

Summary:
This study addresses the challenges in suicidal ideation detection, including limited language coverage and unreliable annotation practices. The researchers constructed a new Turkish suicidal ideation corpus from social media posts and introduced an annotation framework involving human annotators and large language models. They performed a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability and model consistency across multiple datasets, highlighting the need for rigorous and language-inclusive approaches in mental health natural language processing. The study also demonstrated the questionable performance of popular models in zero-shot transfer learning for suicidal ideation detection. The findings emphasize the importance of transparency in model training and dataset construction in mental health NLP, with a focus on data and model reliability.

Abstract: Suicidal ideation detection is critical for real-time suicide prevention, yet its progress faces two under-explored challenges: limited language coverage and unreliable annotation practices. Most available datasets are in English, but even among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a result, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining their annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other languages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by constructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media posts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three human annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the remaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability and model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal ideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained sentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation consistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data. Our findings underscore the need for more rigorous, language-inclusive approaches to annotation and evaluation in mental health natural language processing (NLP) while demonstrating the questionable performance of popular models with zero-shot transfer learning. We advocate for transparency in model training and dataset construction in mental health NLP, prioritizing data and model reliability.

Abstract: The peer review process is often regarded as the gatekeeper of scientific integrity, yet increasing evidence suggests that it is not immune to bias. Although structural inequities in peer review have been widely debated, much less attention has been paid to the subtle ways in which language itself may reinforce disparities. This study undertakes one of the most comprehensive linguistic analyses of peer review to date, examining more than 80,000 reviews in two major journals. Using natural language processing and large-scale statistical modeling, it uncovers how review tone, sentiment, and supportive language vary across author demographics, including gender, race, and institutional affiliation. Using a data set that includes both anonymous and signed reviews, this research also reveals how the disclosure of reviewer identity shapes the language of evaluation. The findings not only expose hidden biases in peer feedback, but also challenge conventional assumptions about anonymity's role in fairness. As academic publishing grapples with reform, these insights raise critical questions about how review policies shape career trajectories and scientific progress.

Summary: 
Multimodal neural networks were trained on data similar to children's language acquisition input. The study focused on the SAYCam dataset, analyzing over 500 hours of video data from three children. Automated speech transcription was used to create vision-and-language datasets for training and evaluation. Various neural network configurations were explored to understand word learning robustness. Results showed that networks trained on each child's transcribed data could effectively learn and generalize word-referent mappings across different network architectures. This study validated the reliability of multimodal neural networks for grounded word learning. It also highlighted the unique learning patterns that emerged when models were trained on individual children's developmental experiences.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What insights can machine learning bring to understanding human language acquisition? Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a fundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from comparatively limited input. To help bridge this gap, researchers have increasingly trained neural networks using data similar in quantity and quality to children's input. Taking this approach to the limit, Vong et al. (2024) showed that a multimodal neural network trained on 61 hours of visual and linguistic input extracted from just one child's developmental experience could acquire word-referent mappings. However, whether this approach's success reflects the idiosyncrasies of a single child's experience, or whether it would show consistent and robust learning patterns across multiple children's experiences was not explored. In this article, we applied automated speech transcription methods to the entirety of the SAYCam dataset, consisting of over 500 hours of video data spread across all three children. Using these automated transcriptions, we generated multi-modal vision-and-language datasets for both training and evaluation, and explored a range of neural network configurations to examine the robustness of simulated word learning. Our findings demonstrate that networks trained on automatically transcribed data from each child can acquire and generalize word-referent mappings across multiple network architectures. These results validate the robustness of multimodal neural networks for grounded word learning, while highlighting the individual differences that emerge in how models learn when trained on each child's developmental experiences.

<div> Sparse Attention, Generative Models, Multi-Behavior Recommendation, Tokenization, Product Knowledge Graphs<br />
Summary:<br />
Generative models are promising for multi-behavior recommendation systems, but face challenges like lack of token reasoning information, high computational costs, and limited multi-scale modeling. To tackle these issues, GRACE framework is introduced, incorporating Chain-of-Thought tokenization for behavior-aligned generation using explicit product attributes. A Journey-Aware Sparse Attention mechanism selectively attends to compressed segments in sequences, improving efficiency. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that GRACE outperforms existing methods significantly, achieving substantial performance boosts in both Home and Electronics domains, along with reduced attention computation for long sequences. <div>
arXiv:2507.14758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated strong potential in multi-behavior recommendation systems, leveraging the expressive power of transformers and tokenization to generate personalized item sequences. However, their adoption is hindered by (1) the lack of explicit information for token reasoning, (2) high computational costs due to quadratic attention complexity and dense sequence representations after tokenization, and (3) limited multi-scale modeling over user history. In this work, we propose GRACE (Generative Recommendation via journey-aware sparse Attention on Chain-of-thought tokEnization), a novel generative framework for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. GRACE introduces a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tokenization method that encodes user-item interactions with explicit attributes from product knowledge graphs (e.g., category, brand, price) over semantic tokenization, enabling interpretable and behavior-aligned generation. To address the inefficiency of standard attention, we design a Journey-Aware Sparse Attention (JSA) mechanism, which selectively attends to compressed, intra-, inter-, and current-context segments in the tokenized sequence. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +106.9% HR@10 and +106.7% NDCG@10 improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Home domain, and +22.1% HR@10 on the Electronics domain. GRACE also reduces attention computation by up to 48% with long sequences.

<div> fusion strategy, compression training, benchmark, performance, efficiency
Summary: 
FastLongSpeech introduces a novel framework to enhance the capabilities of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) for efficient processing of long-form speech. By incorporating an iterative fusion strategy and dynamic compression training approach, it enables the compression of excessively long speech sequences into manageable lengths without requiring dedicated long-speech training data. This framework aims to adapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs and transfer their capabilities to long-speech tasks. To evaluate the performance of LSLMs on long-speech understanding, a benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval is developed. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance in both long-speech and short-speech tasks while significantly improving inference efficiency. The approach addresses the challenges of scarce long-speech training datasets and high computational costs associated with processing long sequences, making it a promising solution for enhancing LSLMs' capabilities in handling long-speech tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant progress in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs), enhancing their capabilities in both speech understanding and generation. While existing LSLMs often concentrate on augmenting speech generation or tackling a diverse array of short-speech tasks, the efficient processing of long-form speech remains a critical yet underexplored challenge. This gap is primarily attributed to the scarcity of long-speech training datasets and the high computational costs associated with long sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce FastLongSpeech, a novel framework designed to extend LSLM capabilities for efficient long-speech processing without necessitating dedicated long-speech training data. FastLongSpeech incorporates an iterative fusion strategy that can compress excessively long-speech sequences into manageable lengths. To adapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs, it introduces a dynamic compression training approach, which exposes the model to short-speech sequences at varying compression ratios, thereby transferring the capabilities of LSLMs to long-speech tasks. To assess the long-speech capabilities of LSLMs, we develop a long-speech understanding benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval. Experiments show that our method exhibits strong performance in both long-speech and short-speech tasks, while greatly improving inference efficiency.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, intent-based chart generation, unsupervised framework, data accuracy metric, finance and scientific domains

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful in generating data visualizations from text using instruction-tuning methods. This study introduces the task of intent-based chart generation from documents, aiming to create charts based on user intents without manual content selection. The proposed two-staged unsupervised framework involves extracting relevant information from documents, validating and refining the data, selecting an appropriate chart type, and generating the final chart code. A novel attribution-based metric is used to evaluate the accuracy of the generated charts. The dataset used for validation includes intent, document, and chart tuples from finance and scientific domains. The approach outperforms baselines in terms of chart data accuracy and chart type accuracy, showcasing its effectiveness in generating high-quality charts based on user intents. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Introduction of intent-based chart generation task
- Two-staged unsupervised framework for chart generation from documents
- Development of a novel attribution-based metric for chart data accuracy evaluation

arXiv:2507.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in transforming text descriptions or tables to data visualizations via instruction-tuning methods. However, it is not straightforward to apply these methods directly for a more real-world use case of visualizing data from long documents based on user-given intents, as opposed to the user pre-selecting the relevant content manually. We introduce the task of intent-based chart generation from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), the goal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on the document(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-staged framework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from the document(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refines this data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart type before final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generated charts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textual representation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics that often fail to capture the chart data effectively. To validate our approach, we curate a dataset comprising of 1,242 $<$intent, document, charts$>$ tuples from two domains, finance and scientific, in contrast to the existing datasets that are largely limited to parallel text descriptions/ tables and their corresponding charts. We compare our approach with baselines using single-shot chart generation using LLMs and query-based retrieval methods; our method outperforms by upto $9$ points and $17$ points in terms of chart data accuracy and chart type respectively over the best baselines.

Summary: <br />
Large-scale reasoning distillation improves small language models' reasoning capabilities, impacting in-context retrieval and reasoning. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require effective contextual information utilization. Distilled reasoning patterns enhance long-context comprehension, promoting detailed and explicit reasoning processes. This improvement addresses the "lost in the middle" issue in long-context models. <div>
arXiv:2507.14849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning distillation has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller language models. However, the impact of large-scale reasoning distillation on other critical abilities, particularly in-context retrieval and reasoning, remains unexplored. This gap in understanding is particularly significant given the increasing importance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where efficient acquisition and utilization of contextual information are paramount for generating reliable responses. Motivated by the need to understand how the extended long-CoT process influences long-context comprehension, we conduct a comprehensive investigation using a series of open-source models distilled from Deepseek-R1, renowned for its exceptional reasoning capabilities. Our study focuses on evaluating these models' performance in extracting and integrating relevant information from extended contexts through multi-document question and answering tasks. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that distilled reasoning patterns significantly improve long-context understanding. Our analysis reveals that distillation fosters greater long-context awareness by promoting more detailed and explicit reasoning processes during context analysis and information parsing. This advancement effectively mitigates the persistent "lost in the middle" issue that has hindered long-context models.

Summary: 
- The study investigates the performance of tiny language models (TLMs) compared to large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP).
- TLMs show a performance gap between pre-trained and non-pre-trained models in classification tasks, indicating the importance of pre-training even at a small scale.
- The performance gap increases with the size of the pre-training dataset and the overlap between tokens in the pre-training and classification datasets.
- A pre-trained deep TLM architecture's classification accuracy can be replicated using a soft committee of multiple independently pre-trained shallow architectures, enabling low-latency TLMs without sacrificing accuracy.
- The study used subsets of the Wikipedia dataset for pre-training BERT-6 and BERT-1 variants, evaluating their performance on FewRel, AGNews, and DBPedia classification tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prominent achievement of natural language processing (NLP) is its ability to understand and generate meaningful human language. This capability relies on complex feedforward transformer block architectures pre-trained on large language models (LLMs). However, LLM pre-training is currently feasible only for a few dominant companies due to the immense computational resources required, limiting broader research participation. This creates a critical need for more accessible alternatives. In this study, we explore whether tiny language models (TLMs) exhibit the same key qualitative features of LLMs. We demonstrate that TLMs exhibit a clear performance gap between pre-trained and non-pre-trained models across classification tasks, indicating the effectiveness of pre-training, even at a tiny scale. The performance gap increases with the size of the pre-training dataset and with greater overlap between tokens in the pre-training and classification datasets. Furthermore, the classification accuracy achieved by a pre-trained deep TLM architecture can be replicated through a soft committee of multiple, independently pre-trained shallow architectures, enabling low-latency TLMs without affecting classification accuracy. Our results are based on pre-training BERT-6 and variants of BERT-1 on subsets of the Wikipedia dataset and evaluating their performance on FewRel, AGNews, and DBPedia classification tasks. Future research on TLM is expected to further illuminate the mechanisms underlying NLP, especially given that its biologically inspired models suggest that TLMs may be sufficient for children or adolescents to develop language.

arXiv:2507.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) excel in text comprehension and generation, their performance on the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task, which requires reasoning ability, is often underperform smaller language model. The main reason is the lack of auxiliary knowledge, which limits LLMs' ability to effectively perceive emotions and reason causes. To address this issue, we propose a novel \textbf{M}ulti-source h\textbf{E}terogeneous \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{i}njection me\textbf{T}hod, MEKiT, which integrates heterogeneous internal emotional knowledge and external causal knowledge. Specifically, for these two distinct aspects and structures of knowledge, we apply the approaches of incorporating instruction templates and mixing data for instruction-tuning, which respectively facilitate LLMs in more comprehensively identifying emotion and accurately reasoning causes. Experimental results demonstrate that MEKiT provides a more effective and adaptable solution for the ECPE task, exhibiting an absolute performance advantage over compared baselines and dramatically improving the performance of LLMs on the ECPE task.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) often experience unexpected code-switching, leading to poor readability in responses. Existing solutions lack effectiveness in addressing this issue. This paper delves into the root cause of code-switching, identifying excessive pre-activation values in language features. The proposed Sparse Autoencoder-guided Supervised Fine-Tuning (SASFT) method aims to mitigate code-switching by training LLMs to maintain appropriate pre-activation values for specific language features. Experimental results across multiple languages show that SASFT significantly reduces unexpected code-switching by over 50% compared to standard fine-tuning methods, with complete elimination in most cases. Furthermore, SASFT maintains or enhances the performance of LLMs on various multilingual benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy in combating code-switching while preserving the models' multilingual capabilities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive multilingual capabilities, but they suffer from unexpected code-switching, also known as language mixing, which involves switching to unexpected languages in the model response. This problem leads to poor readability and degrades the usability of model responses. However, existing work on this issue lacks a mechanistic analysis and shows limited effectiveness. In this paper, we first provide an in-depth analysis of unexpected code-switching using sparse autoencoders and find that when LLMs switch to a language, the features of that language exhibit excessive pre-activation values. Based on our findings, we propose $\textbf{S}$parse $\textbf{A}$utoencoder-guided $\textbf{S}$upervised $\textbf{F}$ine$\textbf{t}$uning (SASFT), which teaches LLMs to maintain appropriate pre-activation values of specific language features during training. Experiments on five models across three languages demonstrate that SASFT consistently reduces unexpected code-switching by more than 50\% compared to standard supervised fine-tuning, with complete elimination in four cases. Moreover, SASFT maintains or even improves the models' performance on six multilingual benchmarks, showing its effectiveness in addressing code-switching while preserving multilingual capabilities.

Summary: <br />
A new method, Neuron State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment (NeuronXA), is proposed to evaluate cross-lingual alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks focus on sentence embeddings, but NeuronXA takes a more semantically grounded approach inspired by neuroscientific findings. It is evaluated on various LLMs and demonstrates high correlations with downstream tasks performance and transferability with only 100 parallel sentence pairs. NeuronXA shows effectiveness in assessing cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with limited data. This method has the potential to advance research on cross-lingual alignment in LLMs and improve their semantic understanding. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual capabilities, however, how to evaluate cross-lingual alignment remains underexplored. Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel Neuron State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability. These findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset. This highlights its potential to advance cross-lingual alignment research and to improve the semantic understanding of multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Evaluating LLMs with a single prompt has proven unreliable, with small changes leading to significant performance differences. However, generating the prompt variations needed for a more robust multi-prompt evaluation is challenging, limiting its adoption in practice. To address this, we introduce PromptSuite, a framework that enables the automatic generation of various prompts. PromptSuite is flexible - working out of the box on a wide range of tasks and benchmarks. It follows a modular prompt design, allowing controlled perturbations to each component, and is extensible, supporting the addition of new components and perturbation types. Through a series of case studies, we show that PromptSuite provides meaningful variations to support strong evaluation practices.

<div> Keywords: Persona-driven LLMs, SYNTHIA dataset, social media users, computational social science, narrative consistency <br />
Summary: <br />
Persona-driven language models (LLMs) are valuable tools in computational social science, but current methods either require human-curated data or produce synthetic personas lacking realism. The SYNTHIA dataset addresses this gap by providing backstories from real social media users on the BlueSky platform, encompassing three time periods.

Abstract: Persona-driven LLMs have emerged as powerful tools in computational social science, yet existing approaches fall at opposite extremes, either relying on costly human-curated data or producing synthetic personas that lack consistency and realism. We introduce SYNTHIA, a dataset of 30,000 backstories derived from 10,000 real social media users from BlueSky open platform across three time windows, bridging this spectrum by grounding synthetic generation in authentic user activity. Our evaluation demonstrates that SYNTHIA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods in demographic diversity and social survey alignment while significantly outperforming them in narrative consistency. Uniquely, SYNTHIA incorporates temporal dimensionality and provides rich social interaction metadata from the underlying network, enabling new research directions in computational social science and persona-driven language modeling.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Test-Time Scaling, Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning, Gamma-control, Efficiency

Summary:
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in Large Language Models (LLMs) can lead to overthinking and wasted computations. To address this, Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR) dynamically allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps by tracking uncertainty. A simple gamma-control mechanism tunes reasoning budgets with a single hyperparameter. Theoretical proof supports MUR's stability and bias superiority over other TTS methods. Evaluation on benchmarks using Qwen3 models of various sizes shows MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy by 0.62-3.37%. MUR enhances reasoning efficiency without the need for additional training, making it a promising approach for optimizing LLM performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on reasoning-intensive tasks, yet optimizing their reasoning efficiency remains an open challenge. While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves reasoning quality, it often leads to overthinking, wasting tokens on redundant computations. This work investigates how to efficiently and adaptively guide LLM test-time scaling without additional training. Inspired by the concept of momentum in physics, we propose Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR), which dynamically allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps by tracking and aggregating stepwise uncertainty over time. To support flexible inference-time control, we introduce gamma-control, a simple mechanism that tunes the reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter. We provide in-depth theoretical proof to support the superiority of MUR in terms of stability and biases. MUR is comprehensively evaluated against various TTS methods across four challenging benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA-diamond) using different sizes of recent Qwen3 models (1.7B, 4B, and 8B). Results demonstrate that MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy by 0.62-3.37%.

Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces RefCritic, a critic module based on reinforcement learning for large language models. It addresses the limitations of supervised fine-tuning in enhancing critique abilities by utilizing dual rule-based rewards for generating high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback. RefCritic outperforms current solutions on various benchmarks, showing gains in critique and refinement settings. It also demonstrates superior scaling with increased voting numbers and outperforms step-level supervised approaches on identifying erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning tasks. The proposed approach provides a more effective and precise guidance for model refinement in the context of large language models. <div>
arXiv:2507.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), developing effective critic modules for precise guidance has become crucial yet challenging. In this paper, we initially demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning for building critic modules (which is widely adopted in current solutions) fails to genuinely enhance models' critique abilities, producing superficial critiques with insufficient reflections and verifications. To unlock the unprecedented critique capabilities, we propose RefCritic, a long-chain-of-thought critic module based on reinforcement learning with dual rule-based rewards: (1) instance-level correctness of solution judgments and (2) refinement accuracies of the policy model based on critiques, aiming to generate high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback that effectively guides model refinement. We evaluate RefCritic on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B across five benchmarks. On critique and refinement settings, RefCritic demonstrates consistent advantages across all benchmarks, e.g., 6.8\% and 7.2\% gains on AIME25 for the respective base models. Notably, under majority voting, policy models filtered by RefCritic show superior scaling with increased voting numbers. Moreover, despite training on solution-level supervision, RefCritic outperforms step-level supervised approaches on ProcessBench, a benchmark to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning.

<br />
Summary: WebShaper introduces a formalization-driven approach to information-seeking (IS) data synthesis for training Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents. By leveraging set theory and Knowledge Projections (KP), WebShaper ensures consistency between information structure and reasoning structure in generating questions and answers. The framework systematically constructs a dataset by starting with seed tasks and expanding them through a multi-step process. An agentic Expander refines the formal questions by using retrieval and validation tools. WebShaper-trained models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on GAIA and WebWalkerQA benchmarks, surpassing existing IS agents. The framework's innovative approach addresses the data scarcity issue in training IS agents and showcases the potential of formalized synthesis methods in enhancing LLM-powered models for complex tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents has revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling solutions to complex, open-ended tasks through web-based information-seeking (IS) capabilities. The scarcity of high-quality training data has limited the development of IS agents. Existing approaches typically adopt an information-driven paradigm that first collects web data and then generates questions based on the retrieval. However, this may lead to inconsistency between information structure and reasoning structure, question and answer. To mitigate, we propose a formalization-driven IS data synthesis framework WebShaper to construct a dataset. WebShaper systematically formalizes IS tasks through set theory. Central to the formalization is the concept of Knowledge Projections (KP), which enables precise control over reasoning structure by KP operation compositions. During synthesis, we begin by creating seed tasks, then use a multi-step expansion process. At each step, an agentic Expander expands the current formal question more complex with retrieval and validation tools based on our formalization. We train our model on the synthesized dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that WebShaper achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced IS agents on GAIA and WebWalkerQA benchmarks.

Summary: <br />
This study compares different methods for modeling DNA sequences using Transformers. Different k-mer segmentation and BPE tokenization techniques are evaluated, with BPE showing superior performance due to its ability to compress motifs, reduce sequence length, and enhance model generalization. RoPE is effective at capturing periodic motifs, while AliBi performs well on tasks with local dependencies. Increasing the depth of Transformer encoders from 3 to 12 layers results in significant performance gains, with little improvement or potential overfitting at 24 layers. This research offers valuable insights for designing DNA Transformer models, providing practical guidance on tokenization and positional encoding strategies. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Currently, many studies view DNA sequences as a special type of language and utilize Transformers to model them. These studies use fixed-length k-mer segmentation and BPE subword tokenization but lack a systematic evaluation to determine which is superior. We compare k-mer segmentation with k=1,3,4,5,6, a 4,096-token BPE vocabulary, and three positional encoding methods-sinusoidal, AliBi, and RoPE. Each configuration is trained from scratch in 3, 6, 12, and 24-layer Transformer encoders and evaluated on GUE benchmark dataset. In general, BPE delivers higher and more stable performance across tasks by compressing frequent motifs into variable-length tokens, reducing sequence length, and improving model generalization. RoPE excels at capturing periodic motifs and extrapolating to long sequences, while AliBi also performs well on tasks driven by local dependencies. In terms of depth, we observe significant gains when increasing layers from 3 to 12, with only marginal improvements or slight overfitting at 24 layers. This study provides practical guidance for designing tokenization and positional encoding in DNA Transformer models.

<title>A Penalty Goes a Long Way: Measuring Lexical Diversity in Synthetic Texts Under Prompt-Influenced Length Variations</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Synthetic Text, Diversity, Lexical Diversity, Response Length

Summary:
Penalty-Adjusted Type-Token Ratio (PATTR) is proposed as a diversity metric that is robust to variations in text length. The study focuses on generating a synthetic corpus for video script generation using various models from the LLaMA, OLMo, and Phi families. Evaluation of per-response lexical diversity using PATTR shows its effectiveness in addressing biases favoring shorter responses compared to existing metrics such as Moving-Average TTR (MATTR) and Compression Ratio (CR). PATTR considers the target response length to mitigate length biases and demonstrates better performance in filtering the most lexically diverse responses. This study emphasizes the importance of diversity in synthetic text generated by Large Language Models and provides a useful metric for evaluating lexical diversity while maintaining adherence to target response length. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly used for further training and improvement of LLMs. Diversity is crucial for the effectiveness of synthetic data, and researchers rely on prompt engineering to improve diversity. However, the impact of prompt variations on response text length, and, more importantly, the consequential effect on lexical diversity measurements, remain underexplored. In this work, we propose Penalty-Adjusted Type-Token Ratio (PATTR), a diversity metric robust to length variations. We generate a large synthetic corpus of over 20M words using seven models from the LLaMA, OLMo, and Phi families, focusing on a creative writing task of video script generation, where diversity is crucial. We evaluate per-response lexical diversity using PATTR and compare it against existing metrics of Moving-Average TTR (MATTR) and Compression Ratio (CR). Our analysis highlights how text length variations introduce biases favoring shorter responses. Unlike existing metrics, PATTR explicitly considers the task-specific target response length ($L_T$) to effectively mitigate length biases. We further demonstrate the utility of PATTR in filtering the top-10/100/1,000 most lexically diverse responses, showing that it consistently outperforms MATTR and CR by yielding on par or better diversity with high adherence to $L_T$.

Summary:  
Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored as generators of commonsense knowledge for Natural Language Inference (NLI). The study evaluates the reliability of LLMs in generating such knowledge and the impact on prediction accuracy. Metrics are adapted to assess LLM factuality and consistency. Explicitly incorporating commonsense knowledge does not consistently enhance overall results but aids in distinguishing entailing instances and moderately improves differentiating contradictory and neutral inferences. The research suggests that while LLMs can be valuable sources of commonsense information for NLI, further refinement is necessary to optimize their effectiveness in enhancing inferential processes. <div>
arXiv:2507.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining the semantic entailment of a premise for a given hypothesis. The task aims to develop systems that emulate natural human inferential processes where commonsense knowledge plays a major role. However, existing commonsense resources lack sufficient coverage for a variety of premise-hypothesis pairs. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models as commonsense knowledge generators for NLI along two key dimensions: their reliability in generating such knowledge and the impact of that knowledge on prediction accuracy. We adapt and modify existing metrics to assess LLM factuality and consistency in generating in this context. While explicitly incorporating commonsense knowledge does not consistently improve overall results, it effectively helps distinguish entailing instances and moderately improves distinguishing contradictory and neutral inferences.

Summary:
This position paper argues that annotation disagreement in Natural Language Inference (NLI) reflects meaningful interpretive variation, particularly when triggered by ambiguity. Underspecified guidelines and annotator behavior can contribute to variation, but content-based ambiguity signals divergent perspectives. The paper advocates for ambiguity-aware NLI by identifying ambiguous input pairs and classifying ambiguity types. A unified framework integrating existing taxonomies is proposed, with concrete examples illustrating key ambiguity subtypes. These examples demonstrate how ambiguity influences annotator decisions and highlight the need for targeted detection methods aligning models with human interpretation. The lack of ambiguity-annotated datasets is identified as a key limitation, with recommendations for new annotated resources and unsupervised ambiguity detection approaches to enhance the robustness and explainability of NLI systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This position paper argues that annotation disagreement in Natural Language Inference (NLI) is not mere noise but often reflects meaningful interpretive variation, especially when triggered by ambiguity in the premise or hypothesis. While underspecified guidelines and annotator behavior can contribute to variation, content-based ambiguity offers a process-independent signal of divergent human perspectives. We call for a shift toward ambiguity-aware NLI by systematically identifying ambiguous input pairs and classifying ambiguity types. To support this, we present a unified framework that integrates existing taxonomies and illustrate key ambiguity subtypes through concrete examples. These examples reveal how ambiguity shapes annotator decisions and motivate the need for targeted detection methods that better align models with human interpretation. A key limitation is the lack of datasets annotated for ambiguity and subtypes. We propose addressing this gap through new annotated resources and unsupervised approaches to ambiguity detection -- paving the way for more robust, explainable, and human-aligned NLI systems.

Summary: In this paper, the impact of homophone normalization in Amharic NLP literature is explored. The study investigates the effects on monolingual training and cross-lingual transfer in languages using the Ge'ez script. It proposes a post-inference normalization approach where normalization is applied to model predictions instead of training data. The results show an increase in BLEU score of up to 1.03 while preserving language features in training. The study emphasizes the importance of language-aware interventions in technology-facilitated language change and suggests a more nuanced approach to homophone normalization in NLP tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.15142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homophone normalization, where characters that have the same sound in a writing script are mapped to one character, is a pre-processing step applied in Amharic Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. While this may improve performance reported by automatic metrics, it also results in models that are not able to understand different forms of writing in a single language. Further, there might be impacts in transfer learning, where models trained on normalized data do not generalize well to other languages. In this paper, we experiment with monolingual training and cross-lingual transfer to understand the impacts of normalization on languages that use the Ge'ez script. We then propose a post-inference intervention in which normalization is applied to model predictions instead of training data. With our simple scheme of post-inference normalization, we show that we can achieve an increase in BLEU score of up to 1.03 while preserving language features in training. Our work contributes to the broader discussion on technology-facilitated language change and calls for more language-aware interventions.

While models showed high precision, they struggled with recall, missing key information. Customised prompts proved most effective, boosting recall by up to 15%. The study proposes guidelines for using LLMs in data extraction, matching automation levels based on task complexity and risk. This offers practical advice for automating data extraction in meta-analyses, balancing LLM efficiency with expert oversight through targeted automation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Automating data extraction from full-text randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for meta-analysis remains a significant challenge. This study evaluates the practical performance of three LLMs (Gemini-2.0-flash, Grok-3, GPT-4o-mini) across tasks involving statistical results, risk-of-bias assessments, and study-level characteristics in three medical domains: hypertension, diabetes, and orthopaedics. We tested four distinct prompting strategies (basic prompting, self-reflective prompting, model ensemble, and customised prompts) to determine how to improve extraction quality. All models demonstrate high precision but consistently suffer from poor recall by omitting key information. We found that customised prompts were the most effective, boosting recall by up to 15\%. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines for using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of automation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice for automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM efficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.

<title>Collaborative Distillation Strategies for Parameter-Efficient Language Model Deployment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high computational cost and slow inference in deploying large language models. It proposes a distillation strategy guided by multiple teacher models. The method constructs several teacher models and integrates their output probability distributions and intermediate semantic features. This guides the student model to learn from multiple sources of knowledge. As a result, the student model gains stronger language understanding and generation ability while maintaining a small parameter size. To achieve this, the paper introduces a weighted output fusion mechanism, a feature alignment loss function, and an entropy-driven dynamic teacher weighting strategy. These components improve the quality and stability of knowledge transfer during distillation. Under multi-teacher guidance, the student model captures semantic information more effectively and demonstrates strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. In particular, the method shows high consistency in expression, generalization ability, and task adaptability in tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and multi-task learning. The experiments compare the proposed method with several widely adopted distillation approaches. The results further confirm its overall advantages in perplexity, distillation loss, and generation quality. This study provides a feasible technical path for the efficient compression of large-scale language models. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-teacher collaborative mechanisms in complex language modeling tasks.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of multi-task, multi-lingual, and multi-source learning approaches on the robustness and performance of pretrained language models. To enhance this analysis, we introduce Subsets of Interest (SOI), a novel categorization framework that identifies six distinct learning behavior patterns during training, including forgettable examples, unlearned examples, and always correct examples. Through SOI transition heatmaps and dataset cartography visualization, we analyze how examples shift between these categories when transitioning from single-setting to multi-setting configurations. We perform comprehensive experiments across three parallel comparisons: multi-task vs. single-task learning using English tasks (entailment, paraphrase, sentiment), multi-source vs. single-source learning using sentiment analysis datasets, and multi-lingual vs. single-lingual learning using intent classification in French, English, and Persian. Our results demonstrate that multi-source learning consistently improves out-of-distribution performance by up to 7%, while multi-task learning shows mixed results with notable gains in similar task combinations. We further introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach where the second stage leverages SOI-based subset selection to achieve additional performance improvements. These findings provide new insights into training dynamics and offer practical approaches for optimizing multi-setting language model performance.

Abstract: Building high-quality data resources is crucial for advancing artificial intelligence research and applications in specific domains, particularly in the Chinese medical domain. Existing Chinese medical datasets are limited in size and narrow in domain coverage, falling short of the diverse corpora required for effective pre-training. Moreover, most datasets are designed solely for LLM fine-tuning and do not support pre-training and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a Chinese medical dataset named ChiMed 2.0, which extends our previous work ChiMed, and covers data collected from Chinese medical online platforms and generated by LLMs. ChiMed 2.0 contains 204.4M Chinese characters covering both traditional Chinese medicine classics and modern general medical data, where there are 164.8K documents for pre-training, 351.6K question-answering pairs for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and 41.7K preference data tuples for RLHF. To validate the effectiveness of our approach for training a Chinese medical LLM, we conduct further pre-training, SFT, and RLHF experiments on representative general domain LLMs and evaluate their performance on medical benchmark datasets. The results show performance gains across different model scales, validating the dataset's effectiveness and applicability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited to some extent by pre-training, so some researchers optimize LLMs through post-training. Existing post-training strategies, such as memory-based retrieval or preference optimization, improve user alignment yet fail to enhance the model's domain cognition. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Dual-Phase Self-Evolution (DPSE) framework that jointly optimizes user preference adaptation and domain-specific competence. DPSE introduces a Censor module to extract multi-dimensional interaction signals and estimate satisfaction scores, which guide structured data expansion via topic-aware and preference-driven strategies. These expanded datasets support a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline: supervised domain grounding followed by frequency-aware preference optimization. Experiments across general NLP benchmarks and long-term dialogue tasks demonstrate that DPSE consistently outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning, Preference Optimization, and Memory-Augmented baselines. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each module. In this way, our framework provides an autonomous path toward continual self-evolution of LLMs.

Abstract: We present a novel evaluation paradigm for AI text detectors that prioritizes real-world and equitable assessment. Current approaches predominantly report conventional metrics like AUROC, overlooking that even modest false positive rates constitute a critical impediment to practical deployment of detection systems. Furthermore, real-world deployment necessitates predetermined threshold configuration, making detector stability (i.e. the maintenance of consistent performance across diverse domains and adversarial scenarios), a critical factor. These aspects have been largely ignored in previous research and benchmarks. Our benchmark, SHIELD, addresses these limitations by integrating both reliability and stability factors into a unified evaluation metric designed for practical assessment. Furthermore, we develop a post-hoc, model-agnostic humanification framework that modifies AI text to more closely resemble human authorship, incorporating a controllable hardness parameter. This hardness-aware approach effectively challenges current SOTA zero-shot detection methods in maintaining both reliability and stability.

<title>On the Inevitability of Left-Leaning Political Bias in Aligned Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The guiding principle of AI alignment is to train large language models (LLMs) to be harmless, helpful, and honest (HHH). At the same time, there are mounting concerns that LLMs exhibit a left-wing political bias. Yet, the commitment to AI alignment cannot be harmonized with the latter critique. In this article, I argue that intelligent systems that are trained to be harmless and honest must necessarily exhibit left-wing political bias. Normative assumptions underlying alignment objectives inherently concur with progressive moral frameworks and left-wing principles, emphasizing harm avoidance, inclusivity, fairness, and empirical truthfulness. Conversely, right-wing ideologies often conflict with alignment guidelines. Yet, research on political bias in LLMs is consistently framing its insights about left-leaning tendencies as a risk, as problematic, or concerning. This way, researchers are actively arguing against AI alignment, tacitly fostering the violation of HHH principles.

Abstract: When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question-answering domains, it is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called multiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA). Although downstream tasks of interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$ different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different LLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such as Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented with the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large models that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to exploiting the information in the options. We conclude that MCQA is no longer a good proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and offer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks that better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Modern moderation systems increasingly support multiple languages, but often fail to address localisation and low-resource variants - creating safety gaps in real-world deployments. Small models offer a potential alternative to large LLMs, yet still demand considerable data and compute. We present LionGuard 2, a lightweight, multilingual moderation classifier tailored to the Singapore context, supporting English, Chinese, Malay, and partial Tamil. Built on pre-trained OpenAI embeddings and a multi-head ordinal classifier, LionGuard 2 outperforms several commercial and open-source systems across 17 benchmarks, including both Singapore-specific and public English datasets. The system is actively deployed within the Singapore Government, demonstrating practical efficacy at scale. Our findings show that high-quality local data and robust multilingual embeddings can achieve strong moderation performance, without fine-tuning large models. We release our model weights and part of our training data to support future work on LLM safety.

Abstract: This work explores entropy analysis as a tool for probing information distribution within Transformer-based architectures. By quantifying token-level uncertainty and examining entropy patterns across different stages of processing, we aim to investigate how information is managed and transformed within these models. As a case study, we apply the methodology to a GPT-based large language model, illustrating its potential to reveal insights into model behavior and internal representations. This approach may offer insights into model behavior and contribute to the development of interpretability and evaluation frameworks for transformer-based models

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in metaphor interpretation across multiple datasets, tasks, and prompt configurations. Although metaphor processing has gained significant attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), previous research has been limited to single-dataset evaluations and specific task settings, often using artificially constructed data through lexical replacement. We address these limitations by conducting extensive experiments using diverse publicly available datasets with inference and metaphor annotations, focusing on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. The results indicate that LLMs' performance is more influenced by features like lexical overlap and sentence length than by metaphorical content, demonstrating that any alleged emergent abilities of LLMs to understand metaphorical language are the result of a combination of surface-level features, in-context learning, and linguistic knowledge. This work provides critical insights into the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in processing figurative language, highlighting the need for more realistic evaluation frameworks in metaphor interpretation tasks. Data and code are publicly available.

<title>STITCH: Simultaneous Thinking and Talking with Chunked Reasoning for Spoken Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15375</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce spoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an internal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans typically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to communicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought process into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking for SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT reasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a novel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken reasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a chunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in a chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the unspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the model continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving simultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of baselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those baselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well on non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models. Some animations and demonstrations are on the project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH.

Abstract: Recent progress in LLMs, such as reasoning models, has demonstrated strong abilities to solve complex competitive programming problems, often rivaling top human competitors. However, it remains underexplored whether these abilities generalize to relevant domains that are less seen during training. To address this, we introduce AlgoSimBench, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs' ability to identify algorithmically similar problems (ASPs)-problems that can be solved using similar algorithmic approaches. AlgoSimBench consists of 1317 problems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which we curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents one algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but algorithmically dissimilar distractors. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs struggle to identify ASPs, with the best-performing model (o3-mini) achieving only 65.9% accuracy on the MCQ task. To address this challenge, we propose attempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem similarity detection. On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy improvement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models. We also evaluated code embedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification. While the adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than random, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative elements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized method, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy.

Abstract: This work evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to power digital assistants capable of complex action execution. These assistants rely on pre-trained programming knowledge to execute multi-step goals by composing objects and functions defined in assistant libraries into action execution programs. To achieve this, we develop ASPERA, a framework comprising an assistant library simulation and a human-assisted LLM data generation engine. Our engine allows developers to guide LLM generation of high-quality tasks consisting of complex user queries, simulation state and corresponding validation programs, tackling data availability and evaluation robustness challenges. Alongside the framework we release Asper-Bench, an evaluation dataset of 250 challenging tasks generated using ASPERA, which we use to show that program generation grounded in custom assistant libraries is a significant challenge to LLMs compared to dependency-free code generation.

<title>Step-level Verifier-guided Hybrid Test-Time Scaling for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is a promising approach to progressively elicit the model's intelligence during inference. Recently, training-based TTS methods, such as continued reinforcement learning (RL), have further surged in popularity, while training-free TTS methods are gradually fading from prominence. However, the additional computation overhead of training amplifies the burden on test-time scaling. In this paper, we focus on training-free TTS methods for reasoning. We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement, a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification. On top of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling. Extensive experiments on five instruction-tuned LLMs across different scales (3B-14B) and families demonstrate that hybrid strategy incorporating various training-free TTS methods at a fine granularity has considerable potential for expanding the reasoning performance boundaries of LLMs.

arXiv:2507.15557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in large language models (LLMs), evaluation of text generation tasks such as text style transfer (TST) remains a significant challenge. Recent studies (Dementieva et al., 2024; Pauli et al., 2025) revealed a substantial gap between automatic metrics and human judgments. Moreover, most prior work focuses exclusively on English, leaving multilingual TST evaluation largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive multilingual study on evaluation of text detoxification system across nine languages: English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Ukrainian, Russian, Amharic. Drawing inspiration from the machine translation, we assess the effectiveness of modern neural-based evaluation models alongside prompting-based LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings provide a practical recipe for designing more reliable multilingual TST evaluation pipeline in the text detoxification case.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging enables non-invasive analysis for applications such as security screening and material classification, but effective image classification remains challenging due to limited annotations, low resolution, and visual ambiguity. We introduce In-Context Learning (ICL) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a flexible, interpretable alternative that requires no fine-tuning. Using a modality-aligned prompting framework, we adapt two open-weight VLMs to the THz domain and evaluate them under zero-shot and one-shot settings. Our results show that ICL improves classification and interpretability in low-data regimes. This is the first application of ICL-enhanced VLMs to THz imaging, offering a promising direction for resource-constrained scientific domains.

<title>Learning to Extract Rational Evidence via Reinforcement Learning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively improves the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, retrieval noises significantly impact the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and promoting effective application in online RAG systems.

Abstract: Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of political reality. In this work, we show how the analysis of conflicting narratives, i.e. conflicting interpretive lenses through which political reality is experienced and told, provides insight into the discursive mechanisms of polarization and issue alignment in the public sphere. Building upon previous work that has identified ideologically polarized issues in the German Twittersphere between 2021 and 2023, we analyze the discursive dimension of polarization by extracting textual signals of conflicting narratives from tweets of opposing opinion groups. Focusing on a selection of salient issues and events (the war in Ukraine, Covid, climate change), we show evidence for conflicting narratives along two dimensions: (i) different attributions of actantial roles to the same set of actants (e.g. diverging interpretations of the role of NATO in the war in Ukraine), and (ii) emplotment of different actants for the same event (e.g. Bill Gates in the right-leaning Covid narrative). Furthermore, we provide first evidence for patterns of narrative alignment, a discursive strategy that political actors employ to align opinions across issues. These findings demonstrate the use of narratives as an analytical lens into the discursive mechanisms of polarization.

Our approach uses pretrained Transformer-based models and proposes several ways to leverage context. In the fallacy classification subtask, our models achieved macro F1-scores of 0.4444 (text), 0.3559 (audio), and 0.4403 (multimodal). Our multimodal model showed performance comparable to the text-only model, suggesting potential for improvements.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) applications often employ multi-component prompts, comprising both system and user prompts, to guide model behaviors. While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of automatically optimizing either the system or user prompt to boost performance, such unilateral approaches often yield suboptimal outcomes due to the interdependent nature of these components. In this work, we introduce P3, a novel self-improvement framework that concurrently optimizes both system and user prompts through an iterative process. The offline optimized prompts are further leveraged to promote online prompting by performing query-dependent prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on general tasks (e.g., Arena-hard and Alpaca-eval) and reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K and GPQA) demonstrate that P3 achieves superior performance in the realm of automatic prompt optimization. Our results highlight the effectiveness of a holistic optimization strategy in enhancing LLM performance across diverse domains.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a central role in evaluating and guiding multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs), especially for mathematical problem solving. However, we identify a pervasive length bias in existing PRMs: they tend to assign higher scores to longer reasoning steps, even when the semantic content and logical validity are unchanged. This bias undermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose outputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose CoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that mitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty adjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related signals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in reward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and informed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and GSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation, improves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically valid reasoning. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of CoLD in improving the fidelity and robustness of PRMs.

Abstract: Receivers in standard signaling game models struggle with learning compositional information. Even when the signalers send compositional messages, the receivers do not interpret them compositionally. When information from one message component is lost or forgotten, the information from other components is also erased. In this paper I construct signaling game models in which genuine compositional understanding evolves. I present two new models: a minimalist receiver who only learns from the atomic messages of a signal, and a generalist receiver who learns from all of the available information. These models are in many ways simpler than previous alternatives, and allow the receivers to learn from the atomic components of messages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been evaluated using diverse question types, e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, and short/long answers. This study answers an unexplored question about the impact of different question types on LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. We investigate the performance of five LLMs on three different types of questions using quantitative and deductive reasoning tasks. The performance metrics include accuracy in the reasoning steps and choosing the final answer. Key Findings: (1) Significant differences exist in LLM performance across different question types. (2) Reasoning accuracy does not necessarily correlate with the final selection accuracy. (3) The number of options and the choice of words, influence LLM performance.

Abstract: The SemEval-2025 Task 11, Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection, introduces an emotion recognition challenge spanning over 28 languages. This competition encourages researchers to explore more advanced approaches to address the challenges posed by the diversity of emotional expressions and background variations. It features two tracks: multi-label classification (Track A) and emotion intensity prediction (Track B), covering six emotion categories: anger, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and disgust. In our work, we systematically explore the benefits of two contrastive learning approaches: sample-based (Contrastive Reasoning Calibration) and generation-based (DPO, SimPO) contrastive learning. The sample-based contrastive approach trains the model by comparing two samples to generate more reliable predictions. The generation-based contrastive approach trains the model to differentiate between correct and incorrect generations, refining its prediction. All models are fine-tuned from LLaMa3-Instruct-8B. Our system achieves 9th place in Track A and 6th place in Track B for English, while ranking among the top-tier performing systems for other languages.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to aid in astronomy and other scientific research, but benchmarks for LLM evaluation in general have not kept pace with the increasingly diverse ways that real people evaluate and use these models. In this study, we seek to improve evaluation procedures by building an understanding of how users evaluate LLMs. We focus on a particular use case: an LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation bot for engaging with astronomical literature, which we deployed via Slack. Our inductive coding of 368 queries to the bot over four weeks and our follow-up interviews with 11 astronomers reveal how humans evaluated this system, including the types of questions asked and the criteria for judging responses. We synthesize our findings into concrete recommendations for building better benchmarks, which we then employ in constructing a sample benchmark for evaluating LLMs for astronomy. Overall, our work offers ways to improve LLM evaluation and ultimately usability, particularly for use in scientific research.

Abstract: Current benchmarks evaluating large language models (LLMs) in ophthalmology are limited in scope and disproportionately prioritise accuracy. We introduce BELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive evaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13 ophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and reasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we curated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse medical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset underwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard questions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the explanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by three senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six LLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) using accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore, BARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human experts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected outputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900 high-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC (260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public leaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and reporting. Importantly, the BELO dataset will remain a hold-out, evaluation-only benchmark to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons of future models.

<title>Understanding Large Language Models' Ability on Interdisciplinary Research</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed their impressive ability to perform multi-step, logic-driven reasoning across complex domains, positioning them as powerful tools and collaborators in scientific discovery while challenging the long-held view that inspiration-driven ideation is uniquely human. However, the lack of a dedicated benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to develop ideas in Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) settings poses a critical barrier to fully understanding their strengths and limitations. To address this gap, we introduce IDRBench -- a pioneering benchmark featuring an expert annotated dataset and a suite of tasks tailored to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in proposing valuable research ideas from different scientific domains for interdisciplinary research. This benchmark aims to provide a systematic framework for assessing LLM performance in complex, cross-domain scientific research. Our dataset consists of scientific publications sourced from the ArXiv platform covering six distinct disciplines, and is annotated by domain experts with diverse academic backgrounds. To ensure high-quality annotations, we emphasize clearly defined dimensions that characterize authentic interdisciplinary research. The design of evaluation tasks in IDRBench follows a progressive, real-world perspective, reflecting the natural stages of interdisciplinary research development, including 1) IDR Paper Identification, 2) IDR Idea Integration, and 3) IDR Idea Recommendation. Using IDRBench, we construct baselines across 10 LLMs and observe that despite fostering some level of IDR awareness, LLMs still struggle to produce quality IDR ideas. These findings could not only spark new research directions, but also help to develop next-generation LLMs that excel in interdisciplinary research.

Abstract: Term frequency-inverse document frequency, or TF-IDF for short, is arguably the most celebrated mathematical expression in the history of information retrieval. Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a given term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of many, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes in diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship dedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that tradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community by demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance testing perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under mild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the $p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical significance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the said negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We further demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to TF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection. The Fisher's exact test justification of TF-IDF equips the working statistician with a ready explanation of the term-weighting scheme's long-established effectiveness.

Abstract: Collecting human-chatbot dialogues typically demands substantial manual effort and is time-consuming, which limits and poses challenges for research on conversational AI. In this work, we propose DialogueForge - a framework for generating AI-simulated conversations in human-chatbot style. To initialize each generated conversation, DialogueForge uses seed prompts extracted from real human-chatbot interactions. We test a variety of LLMs to simulate the human chatbot user, ranging from state-of-the-art proprietary models to small-scale open-source LLMs, and generate multi-turn dialogues tailored to specific tasks. In addition, we explore fine-tuning techniques to enhance the ability of smaller models to produce indistinguishable human-like dialogues. We evaluate the quality of the simulated conversations and compare different models using the UniEval and GTEval evaluation protocols. Our experiments show that large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) generally outperform others in generating more realistic dialogues, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Llama, Mistral) offer promising performance with greater customization. We demonstrate that the performance of smaller models can be significantly improved by employing supervised fine-tuning techniques. Nevertheless, maintaining coherent and natural long-form human-like dialogues remains a common challenge across all models.

<title>Interaction as Intelligence: Deep Research With Human-AI Partnership</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces "Interaction as Intelligence" research series, presenting a reconceptualization of human-AI relationships in deep research tasks. Traditional approaches treat interaction merely as an interface for accessing AI capabilities-a conduit between human intent and machine output. We propose that interaction itself constitutes a fundamental dimension of intelligence. As AI systems engage in extended thinking processes for research tasks, meaningful interaction transitions from an optional enhancement to an essential component of effective intelligence. Current deep research systems adopt an "input-wait-output" paradigm where users initiate queries and receive results after black-box processing. This approach leads to error cascade effects, inflexible research boundaries that prevent question refinement during investigation, and missed opportunities for expertise integration. To address these limitations, we introduce Deep Cognition, a system that transforms the human role from giving instructions to cognitive oversight-a mode of engagement where humans guide AI thinking processes through strategic intervention at critical junctures. Deep cognition implements three key innovations: (1)Transparent, controllable, and interruptible interaction that reveals AI reasoning and enables intervention at any point; (2)Fine-grained bidirectional dialogue; and (3)Shared cognitive context where the system observes and adapts to user behaviors without explicit instruction. User evaluation demonstrates that this cognitive oversight paradigm outperforms the strongest baseline across six key metrics: Transparency(+20.0%), Fine-Grained Interaction(+29.2%), Real-Time Intervention(+18.5%), Ease of Collaboration(+27.7%), Results-Worth-Effort(+8.8%), and Interruptibility(+20.7%). Evaluations on challenging research problems show 31.8% to 50.0% points of improvements over deep research systems.

Abstract: We present Supernova, a 650M-parameter decoder-only transformer that demonstrates how careful architectural design and tokenization innovation can achieve the performance of larger models while maintaining computational efficiency. Our architecture combines Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with a 3:1 compression ratio, RMSNorm for computational efficiency, and SwiGLU activation functions. A critical innovation is our custom 128,000-vocabulary byte-level BPE tokenizer, which achieves state-of-the-art compression performance. Through detailed analysis, we show that Supernova achieves 90% of the performance of 1B-parameter models while using 53% fewer parameters and requiring only 100B training tokens--an order of magnitude less than competing models. Our findings challenge the prevailing scaling paradigm, demonstrating that architectural efficiency and tokenization quality can compensate for reduced parameter counts.

<title>Stabilizing Knowledge, Promoting Reasoning: Dual-Token Constraints for RLVR</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become an effective post-training method for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), mainly by shaping higher-order behaviors such as reflection and planning. However, previous RLVR algorithms often apply uniform training signals to all tokens, without considering the different roles of low-entropy knowledge-related tokens and high-entropy reasoning-related tokens. Some recent methods try to separate these token types by gradient masking or asynchronous updates, but these approaches may break semantic dependencies in the model output and hinder effective learning. In this work, we propose Archer, an entropy-aware RLVR approach with dual-token constraints and synchronous updates. Specifically, our method applies weaker KL regularization and higher clipping thresholds to reasoning tokens to encourage exploration, while using stronger constraints on knowledge tokens to maintain factual knowledge. Experimental results on several mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms previous RLVR methods, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. The code is available at https://github.com/wizard-III/ArcherCodeR.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have dominated the science and media landscape duo to their impressive performance on processing large chunks of data and produce human-like levels of text. Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse. In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures, which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints with performance.

<title>The Impact of Language Mixing on Bilingual LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit language mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought. Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy, suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to 6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.

<title>3LM: Bridging Arabic, STEM, and Code through Benchmarking</title>

Abstract: Arabic is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, yet efforts to develop and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arabic remain relatively limited. Most existing Arabic benchmarks focus on linguistic, cultural, or religious content, leaving a significant gap in domains like STEM and code which are increasingly relevant for real-world LLM applications. To help bridge this gap, we present 3LM, a suite of three benchmarks designed specifically for Arabic. The first is a set of STEM-related question-answer pairs, naturally sourced from Arabic textbooks and educational worksheets. The second consists of synthetically generated STEM questions, created using the same sources. The third benchmark focuses on code generation, built through a careful translation of two widely used code benchmarks, incorporating a human-in-the-loop process with several rounds of review to ensure high-quality and faithful translations. We release all three benchmarks publicly to support the growth of Arabic LLM research in these essential but underrepresented areas.

<title>A Sparsity Predicting Approach for Large Language Models via Activation Pattern Clustering</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant activation sparsity, where only a subset of neurons are active for a given input. Although this sparsity presents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it requires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct prediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast number of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and utilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation pattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently, we group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative clusters. Our method achieves up to 79.34% clustering precision, outperforming standard binary clustering approaches while maintaining minimal degradation in perplexity (PPL) scores. With a sufficiently large number of clusters, our approach attains a PPL score as low as 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By predicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future models can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids. We detail the clustering algorithm, analyze its effectiveness in capturing meaningful activation structures, and demonstrate its potential to improve sparse computation efficiency. This clustering-based formulation serves as a foundation for future work on activation pattern prediction, paving the way for efficient inference in large-scale language models.

Abstract: We present ExCyTIn-Bench, the first benchmark to Evaluate an LLM agent x on the task of Cyber Threat Investigation through security questions derived from investigation graphs. Real-world security analysts must sift through a large number of heterogeneous alert signals and security logs, follow multi-hop chains of evidence, and compile an incident report. With the developments of LLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a promising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we construct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated real-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and related services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage security logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat investigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes on the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as answer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only provides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the pipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the automatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be naturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our comprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the task: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is 0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future research. Code and data are coming soon!

<title>LaCache: Ladder-Shaped KV Caching for Efficient Long-Context Modeling of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in numerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for processing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended outputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in LLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free method for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables LLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range modeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without running out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key innovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only sequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from shallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range dependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range capabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively compresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache size. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective continuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across various tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/LaCache.

Abstract: The automated summarisation of parliamentary debates using large language models (LLMs) offers a promising way to make complex legislative discourse more accessible to the public. However, such summaries must not only be accurate and concise but also equitably represent the views and contributions of all speakers. This paper explores the use of LLMs to summarise plenary debates from the European Parliament and investigates the algorithmic and representational biases that emerge in this context. We propose a structured, multi-stage summarisation framework that improves textual coherence and content fidelity, while enabling the systematic analysis of how speaker attributes -- such as speaking order or political affiliation -- influence the visibility and accuracy of their contributions in the final summaries. Through our experiments using both proprietary and open-weight LLMs, we find evidence of consistent positional and partisan biases, with certain speakers systematically under-represented or misattributed. Our analysis shows that these biases vary by model and summarisation strategy, with hierarchical approaches offering the greatest potential to reduce disparity. These findings underscore the need for domain-sensitive evaluation metrics and ethical oversight in the deployment of LLMs for democratic applications.

Abstract: The rapid development of autonomous web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), while greatly elevating efficiency, exposes the frontier risk of taking unintended or harmful actions. This situation underscores an urgent need for effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To address this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive dataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and facilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193 websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema: SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits to support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from 20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of the reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must approach near-perfect accuracy and recall.

<title>Solo Connection: A Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning Technique for Transformers</title>

arXiv:2507.14353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a versatile and extensible approach for adapting a Large Language Model (LLM) for newer tasks. One of the most prominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on adjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a Generative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo Connection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block level rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo Connection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but it also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and by more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of Large Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy theory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually interpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation, enabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the original 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks, subsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models can include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore the need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning. This paper focuses on long skip connections that link outputs of different decoder blocks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while leveraging pre-trained knowledge.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, for structured deductive qualitative coding. While most current research emphasizes inductive coding applications, we address the underexplored potential of LLMs to perform deductive classification tasks aligned with established human-coded schemes. Using the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) Master Codebook, we classified U.S. Supreme Court case summaries into 21 major policy domains. We tested four intervention methods: zero-shot, few-shot, definition-based, and a novel Step-by-Step Task Decomposition strategy, across repeated samples. Performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics (accuracy, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, Krippendorff's alpha), and construct validity was assessed using chi-squared tests and Cramer's V. Chi-squared and effect size analyses confirmed that intervention strategies significantly influenced classification behavior, with Cramer's V values ranging from 0.359 to 0.613, indicating moderate to strong shifts in classification patterns. The Step-by-Step Task Decomposition strategy achieved the strongest reliability (accuracy = 0.775, kappa = 0.744, alpha = 0.746), achieving thresholds for substantial agreement. Despite the semantic ambiguity within case summaries, ChatGPT displayed stable agreement across samples, including high F1 scores in low-support subclasses. These findings demonstrate that with targeted, custom-tailored interventions, LLMs can achieve reliability levels suitable for integration into rigorous qualitative coding workflows.

Abstract: We construct evaluation tasks where extending the reasoning length of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) deteriorates performance, exhibiting an inverse scaling relationship between test-time compute and accuracy. Our evaluation tasks span four categories: simple counting tasks with distractors, regression tasks with spurious features, deduction tasks with constraint tracking, and advanced AI risks. We identify five distinct failure modes when models reason for longer: 1) Claude models become increasingly distracted by irrelevant information; 2) OpenAI o-series models resist distractors but overfit to problem framings; 3) models shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations; 4) all models show difficulties in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks; and 5) extended reasoning may amplify concerning behaviors, with Claude Sonnet 4 showing increased expressions of self-preservation. These findings suggest that while test-time compute scaling remains promising for improving model capabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns. Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating models across diverse reasoning lengths to identify and address these failure modes in LRMs.

Abstract: Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this scaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually controlling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum length or scaling up by iteratively appending "Wait" when the model is about to terminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time scaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling down by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data distilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior, and scaling up by appending "Wait" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may oscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by enforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models, such as DeepSeek-R1\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much compute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported length. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during reinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when scaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower upper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the test-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down, it is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to unlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve -- rather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.

Abstract: The deployment of agent systems in an enterprise environment is often hindered by several challenges: common models lack domain-specific process knowledge, leading to disorganized plans, missing key tools, and poor execution stability. To address this, this paper introduces Routine, a multi-step agent planning framework designed with a clear structure, explicit instructions, and seamless parameter passing to guide the agent's execution module in performing multi-step tool-calling tasks with high stability. In evaluations conducted within a real-world enterprise scenario, Routine significantly increases the execution accuracy in model tool calls, increasing the performance of GPT-4o from 41.1% to 96.3%, and Qwen3-14B from 32.6% to 83.3%. We further constructed a Routine-following training dataset and fine-tuned Qwen3-14B, resulting in an accuracy increase to 88.2% on scenario-specific evaluations, indicating improved adherence to execution plans. In addition, we employed Routine-based distillation to create a scenario-specific, multi-step tool-calling dataset. Fine-tuning on this distilled dataset raised the model's accuracy to 95.5%, approaching GPT-4o's performance. These results highlight Routine's effectiveness in distilling domain-specific tool-usage patterns and enhancing model adaptability to new scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that Routine provides a practical and accessible approach to building stable agent workflows, accelerating the deployment and adoption of agent systems in enterprise environments, and advancing the technical vision of AI for Process.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Zero-shot online voice conversion (VC) holds significant promise for real-time communications and entertainment. However, current VC models struggle to preserve semantic fidelity under real-time constraints, deliver natural-sounding conversions, and adapt effectively to unseen speaker characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce Conan, a chunkwise online zero-shot voice conversion model that preserves the content of the source while matching the voice timbre and styles of reference speech. Conan comprises three core components: 1) a Stream Content Extractor that leverages Emformer for low-latency streaming content encoding; 2) an Adaptive Style Encoder that extracts fine-grained stylistic features from reference speech for enhanced style adaptation; 3) a Causal Shuffle Vocoder that implements a fully causal HiFiGAN using a pixel-shuffle mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Conan outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective metrics. Audio samples can be found at https://aaronz345.github.io/ConanDemo.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in the fields of mechanical engineering and materials science. As models that establish connections through the interface of language, LLMs can be applied for step-wise reasoning through the Processing-Structure-Property-Performance chain of material science and engineering. Current LLMs are built for adequately representing a dataset, which is the most part of the accessible internet. However, the internet mostly contains non-scientific content. If LLMs should be applied for engineering purposes, it is valuable to investigate models for their intrinsic knowledge -- here: the capacity to generate correct information about materials. In the current work, for the example of the Periodic Table of Elements, we highlight the role of vocabulary and tokenization for the uniqueness of material fingerprints, and the LLMs' capabilities of generating factually correct output of different state-of-the-art open models. This leads to a material knowledge benchmark for an informed choice, for which steps in the PSPP chain LLMs are applicable, and where specialized models are required.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized domains like law, where precision and domain-specific knowledge are critical. This paper presents a streamlined two-stage framework consisting of Retrieval and Re-ranking to enhance legal document retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our approach employs a fine-tuned Bi-Encoder for rapid candidate retrieval, followed by a Cross-Encoder for precise re-ranking, both optimized through strategic negative example mining. Key innovations include the introduction of the Exist@m metric to evaluate retrieval effectiveness and the use of semi-hard negatives to mitigate training bias, which significantly improved re-ranking performance. Evaluated on the SoICT Hackathon 2024 for Legal Document Retrieval, our team, 4Huiter, achieved a top-three position. While top-performing teams employed ensemble models and iterative self-training on large bge-m3 architectures, our lightweight, single-pass approach offered a competitive alternative with far fewer parameters. The framework demonstrates that optimized data processing, tailored loss functions, and balanced negative sampling are pivotal for building robust retrieval-augmented systems in legal contexts.

Abstract: Recent large-scale events like election fraud and financial scams have shown how harmful coordinated efforts by human groups can be. With the rise of autonomous AI systems, there is growing concern that AI-driven groups could also cause similar harm. While most AI safety research focuses on individual AI systems, the risks posed by multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex real-world situations are still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a proof-of-concept to simulate the risks of malicious MAS collusion, using a flexible framework that supports both centralized and decentralized coordination structures. We apply this framework to two high-risk fields: misinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that decentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than centralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them to adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional interventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can adjust their tactics to avoid detection. We present key insights into how these malicious groups operate and the need for better detection systems and countermeasures. Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/RogueAgent.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their performance on complex, multi-page document comprehension remains inadequate, largely due to the lack of high-quality, document-level datasets. While current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods offer partial solutions, they suffer from issues, such as fragmented retrieval contexts, multi-stage error accumulation, and extra time costs of retrieval. In this work, we present a high-quality document-level dataset, Doc-750K, designed to support in-depth understanding of multimodal documents. This dataset includes diverse document structures, extensive cross-page dependencies, and real question-answer pairs derived from the original documents. Building on the dataset, we develop a native multimodal model, Docopilot, which can accurately handle document-level dependencies without relying on RAG. Experiments demonstrate that Docopilot achieves superior coherence, accuracy, and efficiency in document understanding tasks and multi-turn interactions, setting a new baseline for document-level multimodal understanding. Data, code, and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Docopilot

Abstract: The exponential growth of spam text on the Internet necessitates robust detection mechanisms to mitigate risks such as information leakage and social instability. This work addresses two principal challenges: adversarial strategies employed by spammers and the scarcity of labeled data. We propose a novel spam-text detection framework GCC-Spam, which integrates three core innovations. First, a character similarity network captures orthographic and phonetic features to counter character-obfuscation attacks and furthermore produces sentence embeddings for downstream classification. Second, contrastive learning enhances discriminability by optimizing the latent-space distance between spam and normal texts. Third, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) generates realistic pseudo-spam samples to alleviate data scarcity while improving model robustness and classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline approaches, achieving higher detection rates with significantly fewer labeled examples.

<title>The Invisible Leash: Why RLVR May Not Escape Its Origin</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models highlight Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI's capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it remains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or merely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for improved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR. First, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the base model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial probability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an entropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while RLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step, answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.

Abstract: This research introduces an innovative voice-assisted debugging plugin for Python that transforms silent runtime errors into actionable audible diagnostics. By implementing a global exception hook architecture with pyttsx3 text-to-speech conversion and Tkinter-based GUI visualization, the solution delivers multimodal error feedback through parallel auditory and visual channels. Empirical evaluation demonstrates 37% reduced cognitive load (p<0.01, n=50) compared to traditional stack-trace debugging, while enabling 78% faster error identification through vocalized exception classification and contextualization. The system achieves sub-1.2 second voice latency with under 18% CPU overhead during exception handling, vocalizing error types and consequences while displaying interactive tracebacks with documentation deep links. Criteria validate compatibility across Python 3.7+ environments on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Needing only two lines of integration code, the plugin significantly boosts availability for aesthetically impaired designers and supports multitasking workflows through hands-free error medical diagnosis. Educational applications show particular promise, with pilot studies indicating 45% faster debugging skill acquisition among novice programmers. Future development will incorporate GPT-based repair suggestions and real-time multilingual translation to further advance auditory debugging paradigms. The solution represents a fundamental shift toward human-centric error diagnostics, bridging critical gaps in programming accessibility while establishing new standards for cognitive efficiency in software development workflows.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a practical and challenging task. This paper proposes a novel multimodal approach, the Long-Short Distance Graph Neural Network (LSDGNN). Based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), it constructs a long-distance graph neural network and a short-distance graph neural network to obtain multimodal features of distant and nearby utterances, respectively. To ensure that long- and short-distance features are as distinct as possible in representation while enabling mutual influence between the two modules, we employ a Differential Regularizer and incorporate a BiAffine Module to facilitate feature interaction. In addition, we propose an Improved Curriculum Learning (ICL) to address the challenge of data imbalance. By computing the similarity between different emotions to emphasize the shifts in similar emotions, we design a "weighted emotional shift" metric and develop a difficulty measurer, enabling a training process that prioritizes learning easy samples before harder ones. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing benchmarks.

This paper proposes a new method for representing speaker characteristics by extracting context-dependent duration embeddings from speech temporal dynamics. We develop novel attack models using these representations and analyze the potential vulnerabilities in speaker verification and voice anonymization systems.The experimental results show that the developed attack models provide a significant improvement in speaker verification performance for both original and anonymized data in comparison with simpler representations of speech temporal dynamics reported in the literature.

Abstract: Currently, short video platforms have become the primary place for individuals to share experiences and obtain information. To better meet users' needs for acquiring information while browsing short videos, some apps have introduced a search entry at the bottom of videos, accompanied with recommended relevant queries. This scenario is known as query recommendation in video-related search, where core task is item-to-query (I2Q) recommendation. As this scenario has only emerged in recent years, there is a notable scarcity of academic research and publicly available datasets in this domain. To address this gap, we systematically examine the challenges associated with this scenario for the first time. Subsequently, we release a large-scale dataset derived from real-world data pertaining to the query recommendation in video-\textit{\textbf{r}}elated \textit{\textbf{s}}earch on the \textit{\textbf{Kuai}}shou app (\textbf{KuaiRS}). Presently, existing methods rely on embeddings to calculate similarity for matching short videos with queries, lacking deep interaction between the semantic content and the query. In this paper, we introduce a novel LLM-based framework named \textbf{GREAT}, which \textit{\textbf{g}}uides que\textit{\textbf{r}}y g\textit{\textbf{e}}ner\textit{\textbf{a}}tion with a \textit{\textbf{t}}rie to address I2Q recommendation in related search. Specifically, we initially gather high-quality queries with high exposure and click-through rate to construct a query-based trie. During training, we enhance the LLM's capability to generate high-quality queries using the query-based trie. In the inference phase, the query-based trie serves as a guide for the token generation. Finally, we further refine the relevance and literal quality between items and queries via a post-processing module. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: We present a speaker conditioned text-to-speech (TTS) system aimed at addressing challenges in generating speech for unseen speakers and supporting diverse Indian languages. Our method leverages a diffusion-based TTS architecture, where a speaker encoder extracts embeddings from short reference audio samples to condition the DDPM decoder for multispeaker generation. To further enhance prosody and naturalness, we employ a cross-attention based duration prediction mechanism that utilizes reference audio, enabling more accurate and speaker consistent timing. This results in speech that closely resembles the target speaker while improving duration modeling and overall expressiveness. Additionally, to improve zero-shot generation, we employed classifier free guidance, allowing the system to generate speech more near speech for unknown speakers. Using this approach, we trained language-specific speaker-conditioned models. Using the IndicSUPERB dataset for multiple Indian languages such as Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Punjabi and Tamil.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) allows us to train models, such as language models (LMs), to follow complex human preferences. In RLHF for LMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of responses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward model (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward given by the RM. As training progresses, the responses generated by the LM no longer resemble the responses seen by the RM during training, leading to the RM becoming inaccurate. The score given by the RM keeps increasing, but the learned behavior no longer matches the human preferences. This issue is known as overoptimization. We investigate overoptimization from the point of view of distribution shift and show that the shift results in an inconsistent estimate of the RM parameters, leading to an inconsistent estimate of the policy gradient. We propose Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM), which iteratively off-policy corrects the RM using importance weighting, without requiring new labels or samples. This results in a more accurate RM, which empirically leads to an improved final policy. We validate our approach in experiments with summarization and chatbot datasets and show that it performs significantly better than standard RLHF methods and baselines. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/JohannesAck/OffPolicyCorrectedRewardModeling

Abstract: Continual pre-training on small-scale task-specific data is an effective method for improving large language models in new target fields, yet it risks catastrophic forgetting of their original capabilities. A common solution is to re-weight training data mixtures from source and target fields on a domain space to achieve balanced performance. Previous domain reweighting strategies rely on manual designation with certain heuristics based on human intuition or empirical results. In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be parameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end framework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable heuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing trajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment. Experiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing Agent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across source and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across unseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining. Direct application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability across target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned heuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior model performance with less source-field data.

arXiv:2507.15743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the promise of conversational AI systems for diagnostic dialogue. However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that providing individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated activity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee other team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or physician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework for effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent system that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from individualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an overseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The PCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision. This effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen asynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we compared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across 60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality intake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the overseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions. PCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP consultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing clinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our results demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible paradigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for enhancing real-world care.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance through extended chain-of-thought sequences, yet this computational freedom leads to excessive token generation even for simple problems. We present Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization (LAPO), a novel framework that transforms reasoning length control from an external constraint into an intrinsic model capability. Unlike existing approaches that impose rigid limits or rely on post-hoc interventions, LAPO enables models to internalize an understanding of appropriate reasoning depth through a two-stage reinforcement learning process. In the first stage, models learn natural reasoning patterns by discovering the statistical distribution of successful solution lengths. The second stage leverages these patterns as meta-cognitive guidance, embedding them directly within the model's reasoning context to ensure inference-time flexibility. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LAPO reduces token usage by up to 40.9\% while improving accuracy by 2.3\%. Our analysis reveals that models trained with LAPO develop emergent abilities to allocate computational resources based on problem complexity, achieving efficient reasoning without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Parr et al., 2025 examines how auto-regressive and deep temporal models differ in their treatment of non-Markovian sequence modelling. Building on this, we highlight the need for dissociating model architectures, i.e., how the predictive distribution factorises, from the computations invoked at inference. We demonstrate that deep temporal computations are mimicked by autoregressive models by structuring context access during iterative inference. Using a transformer trained on next-token prediction, we show that inducing hierarchical temporal factorisation during iterative inference maintains predictive capacity while instantiating fewer computations. This emphasises that processes for constructing and refining predictions are not necessarily bound to their underlying model architectures.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent capabilities in complex reasoning, largely spurred by rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques applied during the post-training. This has raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced, human-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This paper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and generalizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We conduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of prominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for generalization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that small LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on in-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM tasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of the training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain data but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks. This suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than the acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability.

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive chain-of-thought generation, yet exhibit significant computational inefficiency by applying uniform reasoning strategies regardless of problem complexity. We present Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement learning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning depths without sacrificing capability. HBPO addresses the fundamental challenge of exploration space collapse in efficiency-oriented training, where penalties on long output length systematically bias models away from necessary long reasoning paths. Through hierarchical budget exploration, our approach partitions rollout samples into multiple subgroups with distinct token budgets, aiming to enable efficient resource allocation while preventing degradation of capability. We introduce differentiated reward mechanisms that create budget-aware incentives aligned with the complexity of the problem, allowing models to discover natural correspondences between task requirements and computational effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO reduces average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across four reasoning benchmarks. Unlike existing methods that impose external constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive behavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are not inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through appropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration diversity.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions. This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions. Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of 24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI interaction tasks.

Abstract: Story detection in online communities is a challenging task as stories are scattered across communities and interwoven with non-storytelling spans within a single text. We address this challenge by building and releasing the StorySeeker toolkit, including a richly annotated dataset of 502 Reddit posts and comments, a detailed codebook adapted to the social media context, and models to predict storytelling at the document and span levels. Our dataset is sampled from hundreds of popular English-language Reddit communities ranging across 33 topic categories, and it contains fine-grained expert annotations, including binary story labels, story spans, and event spans. We evaluate a range of detection methods using our data, and we identify the distinctive textual features of online storytelling, focusing on storytelling spans. We illuminate distributional characteristics of storytelling on a large community-centric social media platform, and we also conduct a case study on r/ChangeMyView, where storytelling is used as one of many persuasive strategies, illustrating that our data and models can be used for both inter- and intra-community research. Finally, we discuss implications of our tools and analyses for narratology and the study of online communities.

Abstract: Dialogue systems (DS), including the task-oriented dialogue system (TOD) and the open-domain dialogue system (ODD), have always been a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), allowing various applications in practice. Owing to sophisticated training and well-designed model architecture, language models (LM) are usually adopted as the necessary backbone to build the dialogue system. Consequently, every breakthrough in LM brings about a shift in learning paradigm and research attention within dialogue system, especially the appearance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we take a deep look at the history of the dialogue system, especially its special relationship with the advancements of language models. Thus, our survey offers a systematic perspective, categorizing different stages in a chronological order aligned with LM breakthroughs, providing a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research outcomes. What's more, we turn our attention to emerging topics and engage in a discussion on open challenges, providing valuable insights into the future directions for LLM-based dialogue systems. In summary, this survey delves into the dynamic interplay between language models and dialogue systems, unraveling the evolutionary path of this essential relationship. Through this exploration, we pave the way for a deeper comprehension of the field, guiding future developments in LM-based dialogue systems.

Abstract: Joint punctuated and normalized automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims at outputing transcripts with and without punctuation and casing. This task remains challenging due to the lack of paired speech and punctuated text data in most ASR corpora. We propose two approaches to train an end-to-end joint punctuated and normalized ASR system using limited punctuated data. The first approach uses a language model to convert normalized training transcripts into punctuated transcripts. This achieves a better performance on out-of-domain test data, with up to 17% relative Punctuation-Case-aware Word Error Rate (PC-WER) reduction. The second approach uses a single decoder conditioned on the type of output. This yields a 42% relative PC-WER reduction compared to Whisper-base and a 4% relative (normalized) WER reduction compared to the normalized output of a punctuated-only model. Additionally, our proposed model demonstrates the feasibility of a joint ASR system using as little as 5% punctuated training data with a moderate (2.42% absolute) PC-WER increase.

Abstract: This paper presents the development process of a Vietnamese spoken language corpus for machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks and provides insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with using real-world data for machine reading comprehension tasks. The existing MRC corpora in Vietnamese mainly focus on formal written documents such as Wikipedia articles, online newspapers, or textbooks. In contrast, the VlogQA consists of 10,076 question-answer pairs based on 1,230 transcript documents sourced from YouTube -- an extensive source of user-uploaded content, covering the topics of food and travel. By capturing the spoken language of native Vietnamese speakers in natural settings, an obscure corner overlooked in Vietnamese research, the corpus provides a valuable resource for future research in reading comprehension tasks for the Vietnamese language. Regarding performance evaluation, our deep-learning models achieved the highest F1 score of 75.34% on the test set, indicating significant progress in machine reading comprehension for Vietnamese spoken language data. In terms of EM, the highest score we accomplished is 53.97%, which reflects the challenge in processing spoken-based content and highlights the need for further improvement.

Abstract: Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in performing different tasks is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses. This paper presents Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT), grounded on human cognitive principles and designed to assess LLMs by examining the cognitive demands of various tasks. The HPT utilizes the Hierarchical Prompting Framework (HPF), which structures five unique prompting strategies in a hierarchical order based on their cognitive requirement on LLMs when compared to human mental capabilities. It assesses the complexity of tasks with the Hierarchical Prompting Index (HPI), which demonstrates the cognitive competencies of LLMs across diverse datasets and offers insights into the cognitive demands that datasets place on different LLMs. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation of an LLMs problem solving abilities and the intricacy of a dataset, offering a standardized metric for task complexity. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets and LLMs show that HPF enhances LLM performance by 2% to 63% compared to baseline performance, with GSM8k being the most cognitively complex task among reasoning and coding tasks with an average HPI of 3.20 confirming the effectiveness of HPT. To support future research and reproducibility in this domain, the implementations of HPT and HPF are available here.

Abstract: The popular frameworks for self-supervised learning of speech representations have largely focused on frame-level masked prediction of speech regions. While this has shown promising downstream task performance for speech recognition and related tasks, this has largely ignored factors of speech that are encoded at coarser level, like characteristics of the speaker or channel that remain consistent through-out a speech utterance. In this work, we propose a framework for Learning Disentangled Self Supervised (termed as Learn2Diss) representations of speech, which consists of frame-level and an utterance-level encoder modules. The two encoders are initially learned independently, where the frame-level model is largely inspired by existing self supervision techniques, thereby learning pseudo-phonemic representations, while the utterance-level encoder is inspired by constrastive learning of pooled embeddings, thereby learning pseudo-speaker representations. The joint learning of these two modules consists of disentangling the two encoders using a mutual information based criterion. With several downstream evaluation experiments, we show that the proposed Learn2Diss achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks, with the frame-level encoder representations improving semantic tasks, while the utterance-level representations improve non-semantic tasks.

<title>Why Does New Knowledge Create Messy Ripple Effects in LLMs?</title>

Abstract: Extensive previous research has focused on post-training knowledge editing (KE) for language models (LMs) to ensure that knowledge remains accurate and up-to-date. One desired property and open question in KE is to let edited LMs correctly handle ripple effects, where LM is expected to answer its logically related knowledge accurately. In this paper, we answer the question of why most KE methods still create messy ripple effects. We conduct extensive analysis and identify a salient indicator, GradSim, that effectively reveals when and why updated knowledge ripples in LMs. GradSim is computed by the cosine similarity between gradients of the original fact and its related knowledge. We observe a strong positive correlation between ripple effect performance and GradSim across different LMs, KE methods, and evaluation metrics. Further investigations into three counter-intuitive failure cases (Negation, Over-Ripple, Multi-Lingual) of ripple effects demonstrate that these failures are often associated with very low GradSim. This finding validates that GradSim is an effective indicator of when knowledge ripples in LMs.

Abstract: Automated fact-checking is a key strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the internet. These systems typically leverage deep learning approaches through Natural Language Inference (NLI) to verify the truthfulness of information based on supporting evidence. However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0.8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend remarkable capabilities of text-only large language models and vision-only models, and are able to learn from and process multi-modal vision-text input. While modern VLMs perform well on a number of standard image classification and image-text matching tasks, they still struggle with a number of crucial vision-language (VL) reasoning abilities such as counting and spatial reasoning. Moreover, while they might be very brittle to small variations in instructions and/or evaluation protocols, existing benchmarks fail to evaluate their robustness (or rather the lack of it). In order to couple challenging VL scenarios with comprehensive robustness evaluation, we introduce DARE, Diverse Visual Question Answering with Robustness Evaluation, a carefully created and curated multiple-choice VQA benchmark. DARE evaluates VLM performance on five diverse categories and includes four robustness-oriented evaluations based on the variations of: prompts, the subsets of answer options, the output format and the number of correct answers. Among a spectrum of other findings, we report that state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle with questions in most categories and are unable to consistently deliver their peak performance across the tested robustness evaluations. The worst case performance across the subsets of options is up to 34% below the performance in the standard case. The robustness of the open-source VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6 and Idefics2 cannot match the closed-source models such as GPT-4 and Gemini, but even the latter remain very brittle to different variations.

Abstract: Neural dependency parsing has achieved remarkable performance for low resource morphologically rich languages. It has also been well-studied that morphologically rich languages exhibit relatively free word order. This prompts a fundamental investigation: Is there a way to enhance dependency parsing performance, making the model robust to word order variations utilizing the relatively free word order nature of morphologically rich languages? In this work, we examine the robustness of graph-based parsing architectures on 7 relatively free word order languages. We focus on scrutinizing essential modifications such as data augmentation and the removal of position encoding required to adapt these architectures accordingly. To this end, we propose a contrastive self-supervised learning method to make the model robust to word order variations. Furthermore, our proposed modification demonstrates a substantial average gain of 3.03/2.95 points in 7 relatively free word order languages, as measured by the UAS/LAS Score metric when compared to the best performing baseline.

Abstract: To broaden the dissemination of scientific knowledge to diverse audiences, it is desirable for scientific document summarization systems to simultaneously control multiple attributes such as length and empirical focus. However, existing research typically focuses on controlling single attributes, leaving the compositional control of multiple attributes underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CCSBench, the first evaluation benchmark for compositional controllable summarization in the scientific domain. Our benchmark enables fine-grained control over both explicit attributes (e.g., length), which are objective and straightforward, and implicit attributes (e.g., conceptual or empirical focus), which are more subjective and abstract. We conduct extensive experiments using various large language models (LLMs) under various settings, including in-context learning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and two-stage modular methods for balancing control over different attributes. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs capabilities in balancing trade-offs between control attributes, especially implicit ones that require deeper understanding and abstract reasoning.

Abstract: Vertical text input is commonly encountered in various real-world applications, such as mathematical computations and word-based Sudoku puzzles. While current large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural language tasks, they remain vulnerable to variations in text formatting. Recent research demonstrates that modifying input formats, such as vertically aligning words for encoder-based models, can substantially lower accuracy in text classification tasks. While easily understood by humans, these inputs can significantly mislead models, posing a potential risk of bypassing detection in real-world scenarios involving harmful or sensitive information. With the expanding application of LLMs, a crucial question arises: \textit{Do decoder-based LLMs exhibit similar vulnerabilities to vertically formatted text input?} In this paper, we investigate the impact of vertical text input on the performance of various LLMs across multiple text classification datasets and analyze the underlying causes. Our findings are as follows: (i) Vertical text input significantly degrades the accuracy of LLMs in text classification tasks. (ii) \textit{Chain of Thought (CoT)} reasoning does not help LLMs recognize vertical input or mitigate its vulnerability, but \textit{few-shot learning} with careful analysis does. (iii) We explore the underlying cause of the vulnerability by analyzing the inherent issues in tokenization and attention matrices.

Abstract: Current automated fact-checking (AFC) approaches typically evaluate evidence either implicitly via the predicted verdicts or through exact matches with predefined closed knowledge sources, such as Wikipedia. However, these methods are limited due to their reliance on evaluation metrics originally designed for other purposes and constraints from closed knowledge sources. In this work, we introduce \textbf{\textcolor{skyblue}{Ev\textsuperscript{2}}\textcolor{orangebrown}{R}} which combines the strengths of reference-based evaluation and verdict-level proxy scoring. Ev\textsuperscript{2}R jointly assesses how well the evidence aligns with the gold references and how reliably it supports the verdict, addressing the shortcomings of prior methods. We evaluate Ev\textsuperscript{2}R against three types of evidence evaluation approaches: reference-based, proxy-reference, and reference-less baselines. Assessments against human ratings and adversarial tests demonstrate that Ev\textsuperscript{2}R consistently outperforms existing scoring approaches in accuracy and robustness. It achieves stronger correlation with human judgments and greater robustness to adversarial perturbations, establishing it as a reliable metric for evidence evaluation in AFC.\footnote{Code is available at \href{https://github.com/mubasharaak/fc-evidence-evaluation}{https://github.com/mubasharaak/fc-evidence-evaluation}.}

Abstract: Question answering represents a core capability of large language models (LLMs). However, when individuals encounter unfamiliar knowledge in texts, they often formulate questions that the text itself cannot answer due to insufficient understanding of the underlying information. Recent studies reveal that while LLMs can detect unanswerable questions, they struggle to assist users in reformulating these questions. Even advanced models like GPT-3.5 demonstrate limited effectiveness in this regard. To address this limitation, we propose DRS: Deep Question Reformulation with Structured Output, a novel zero-shot method aimed at enhancing LLMs ability to assist users in reformulating questions to extract relevant information from new documents. DRS combines the strengths of LLMs with a DFS-based algorithm to iteratively explore potential entity combinations and constrain outputs using predefined entities. This structured approach significantly enhances the reformulation capabilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that DRS improves the reformulation accuracy of GPT-3.5 from 23.03% to 70.42%, while also enhancing the performance of open-source models, such as Gemma2-9B, from 26.35% to 56.75%.

Abstract: Game-theoretic scenarios have become pivotal in evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Model (LLM)-based social agents. While numerous studies have explored these agents in such settings, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey summarizing the current progress. To address this gap, we systematically review existing research on LLM-based social agents within game-theoretic scenarios. Our survey organizes the findings into three core components: Game Framework, Social Agent, and Evaluation Protocol. The game framework encompasses diverse game scenarios, ranging from choice-focusing to communication-focusing games. The social agent part explores agents' preferences, beliefs, and reasoning abilities, as well as their interactions and synergistic effects on decision-making. The evaluation protocol covers both game-agnostic and game-specific metrics for assessing agent performance. Additionally, we analyze the performance of current social agents across various game scenarios. By reflecting on the current research and identifying future research directions, this survey provides insights to advance the development and evaluation of social agents in game-theoretic scenarios.

Abstract: As chatbots become integral to daily life, personalizing systems is key for fostering trust, engagement, and inclusivity. This study examines how linguistic similarity affects chatbot performance, focusing on integrating African American English (AAE) into virtual agents to better serve the African American community. We develop text-based and spoken chatbots using large language models and text-to-speech technology, then evaluate them with AAE speakers against standard English chatbots. Our results show that while text-based AAE chatbots often underperform, spoken chatbots benefit from an African American voice and AAE elements, improving performance and preference. These findings underscore the complexities of linguistic personalization and the dynamics between text and speech modalities, highlighting technological limitations that affect chatbots' AA speech generation and pointing to promising future research directions.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems, where specialized agents collaborate to solve a shared task hold great potential, from increased modularity to simulating complex environments. However, they also have a major caveat -- a single agent can cause the entire system to fail. Consider a simple game where the knowledge to solve the task is distributed between agents, which share information in a communication channel. At each round, any of the agents can terminate the game and make the final prediction, even if they are uncertain about the outcome of their action. Detection of such rogue agents before they act may prevent the system's failure. In this work, we propose to monitor agents during action prediction and intervene when a future error is likely to occur. To test our approach, we introduce WhoDunitEnv, a multi-agent collaboration environment that allows modular control over task complexity and communication structure. Experiments on WhoDunitEnv, code generation tasks and the GovSim environment for resource sustainability show that our approach leads to substantial performance gains up to 17.4%, 2.5% and 20%, respectively. Thorough analysis shows that our monitors successfully identify critical points of agent confusion and our interventions effectively stop agent errors from propagating.

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in NLP, directly impacting large language models' (LLMs) ability to capture syntactic, morphosyntactic, and semantic structures. This paper introduces a novel framework for systematically evaluating tokenization strategies, addressing challenges in morphologically rich and low-resource languages. Using a Turkish dataset of 6,200 multiple-choice questions from the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, the framework assesses tokenizers across five key metrics: vocabulary size, token count, processing time, language-specific token percentages (\%TR), and token purity. These metrics provide a structured approach to evaluating how well tokenizers preserve linguistic structures. While \%TR measures the proportion of valid words in the target language, \%Pure assesses the alignment of tokens with meaningful linguistic units, such as roots and valid morphemes, minimizing semantic fragmentation. The findings reveal that \%TR, introduced as a critical metric, exhibits a stronger correlation with downstream performance (e.g., MMLU scores) than token purity, emphasizing its role in improving model accuracy. Additionally, larger model parameters do not necessarily yield better tokenization quality or enhanced results, highlighting the importance of tailored tokenization strategies that prioritize linguistic alignment. This framework sets a new standard for developing robust tokenization methods optimized for morphologically complex and low-resource languages. Future work will refine morphological analysis, explore domain-specific customizations, and conduct cross-linguistic evaluations to further enhance tokenization practices.

Abstract: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) encode interwoven scientific knowledge, using chemical elements and LLaMA-series models as a case study. We identify a 3D spiral structure in the hidden states that aligns with the conceptual structure of the periodic table, suggesting that LLMs can reflect the geometric organization of scientific concepts learned from text. Linear probing reveals that middle layers encode continuous, overlapping attributes that enable indirect recall, while deeper layers sharpen categorical distinctions and incorporate linguistic context. These findings suggest that LLMs represent symbolic knowledge not as isolated facts, but as structured geometric manifolds that intertwine semantic information across layers. We hope this work inspires further exploration of how LLMs represent and reason about scientific knowledge, particularly in domains such as materials science.

Abstract: Synthetic high-quality multi-step reasoning data can significantly enhance the performance of large language models on various tasks. However, most existing methods rely on rejection sampling, which generates trajectories independently and suffers from inefficiency and imbalanced sampling across problems of varying difficulty. In this work, we introduce FastMCTS, an innovative data synthesis strategy inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search. FastMCTS provides a more efficient sampling method for multi-step reasoning data, offering step-level evaluation signals and promoting balanced sampling across problems of different difficulty levels. Experiments on both English and Chinese reasoning datasets demonstrate that FastMCTS generates over 30\% more correct reasoning paths compared to rejection sampling as the number of generated tokens scales up. Furthermore, under comparable synthetic data budgets, models trained on FastMCTS-generated data outperform those trained on rejection sampling data by 3.9\% across multiple benchmarks. As a lightweight sampling strategy, FastMCTS offers a practical and efficient alternative for synthesizing high-quality reasoning data. Our code will be released soon.

Abstract: Despite progress in Arabic large language models, such as Jais and AceGPT, their evaluation on commonsense reasoning has largely relied on machine-translated datasets, which lack cultural depth and may introduce Anglocentric biases. Commonsense reasoning is shaped by geographical and cultural contexts, and existing English datasets fail to capture the diversity of the Arab world. To address this, we introduce ArabCulture, a commonsense reasoning dataset in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), covering cultures of 13 countries across the Gulf, Levant, North Africa, and the Nile Valley. The dataset was built from scratch by engaging native speakers to write and validate culturally relevant questions for their respective countries. ArabCulture spans 12 daily life domains with 54 fine-grained subtopics, reflecting various aspects of social norms, traditions, and everyday experiences. Zero-shot evaluations show that open-weight language models with up to 32B parameters struggle to comprehend diverse Arab cultures, with performance varying across regions. These findings highlight the need for more culturally aware models and datasets tailored to the Arabic-speaking world.

Abstract: Despite having a population of twenty million, Kazakhstan's culture and language remain underrepresented in the field of natural language processing. Although large language models (LLMs) continue to advance worldwide, progress in Kazakh language has been limited, as seen in the scarcity of dedicated models and benchmark evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce KazMMLU, the first MMLU-style dataset specifically designed for Kazakh language. KazMMLU comprises 23,000 questions that cover various educational levels, including STEM, humanities, and social sciences, sourced from authentic educational materials and manually validated by native speakers and educators. The dataset includes 10,969 Kazakh questions and 12,031 Russian questions, reflecting Kazakhstan's bilingual education system and rich local context. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art multilingual models (Llama-3.1, Qwen-2.5, GPT-4, and DeepSeek V3) demonstrates substantial room for improvement, as even the best-performing models struggle to achieve competitive performance in Kazakh and Russian. These findings underscore significant performance gaps compared to high-resource languages. We hope that our dataset will enable further research and development of Kazakh-centric LLMs. Data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recently, LLMs have garnered increasing attention across academic disciplines for their potential as human digital twins, virtual proxies designed to replicate individuals and autonomously perform tasks such as decision-making, problem-solving, and reasoning on their behalf. However, current evaluations of LLMs primarily emphasize dialogue simulation while overlooking human behavior simulation, which is crucial for digital twins. To address this gap, we introduce BehaviorChain, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to simulate continuous human behavior. BehaviorChain comprises diverse, high-quality, persona-based behavior chains, totaling 15,846 distinct behaviors across 1,001 unique personas, each with detailed history and profile metadata. For evaluation, we integrate persona metadata into LLMs and employ them to iteratively infer contextually appropriate behaviors within dynamic scenarios provided by BehaviorChain. Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrated that even state-of-the-art models struggle with accurately simulating continuous human behavior.

<title>MKE-Coder: Multi-Axial Knowledge with Evidence Verification in ICD Coding for Chinese EMRs</title>

Abstract: The task of automatically coding the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in the medical field has been well-established and has received much attention. Automatic coding of the ICD in the medical field has been successful in English but faces challenges when dealing with Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs). The first issue lies in the difficulty of extracting disease code-related information from Chinese EMRs, primarily due to the concise writing style and specific internal structure of the EMRs. The second problem is that previous methods have failed to leverage the disease-based multi-axial knowledge and lack of association with the corresponding clinical evidence. This paper introduces a novel framework called MKE-Coder: Multi-axial Knowledge with Evidence verification in ICD coding for Chinese EMRs. Initially, we identify candidate codes for the diagnosis and categorize each of them into knowledge under four coding axes.Subsequently, we retrieve corresponding clinical evidence from the comprehensive content of EMRs and filter credible evidence through a scoring model. Finally, to ensure the validity of the candidate code, we propose an inference module based on the masked language modeling strategy. This module verifies that all the axis knowledge associated with the candidate code is supported by evidence and provides recommendations accordingly. To evaluate the performance of our framework, we conduct experiments using a large-scale Chinese EMR dataset collected from various hospitals. The experimental results demonstrate that MKE-Coder exhibits significant superiority in the task of automatic ICD coding based on Chinese EMRs. In the practical evaluation of our method within simulated real coding scenarios, it has been demonstrated that our approach significantly aids coders in enhancing both their coding accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on some tasks, while exhibiting distinctly non-human-like behaviors on others. This raises the question of how well the LLM's learned representations align with human representations. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to study representation alignment: we adopt a method from research on activation steering to identify neurons responsible for specific concepts (e.g., ''cat'') and then analyze the corresponding activation patterns. We find that LLM representations captured this way closely align with human representations inferred from behavioral data, matching inter-human alignment levels. Our approach significantly outperforms the alignment captured by word embeddings, which have been the focus of prior work on human-LLM alignment. Additionally, our approach enables a more granular view of how LLMs represent concepts -- we show that LLMs organize concepts in a way that mirrors human concept organization.

Abstract: Aligned representations across languages is a desired property in multilingual large language models (mLLMs), as alignment can improve performance in cross-lingual tasks. Typically alignment requires fine-tuning a model, which is computationally expensive, and sizable language data, which often may not be available. A data-efficient alternative to fine-tuning is model interventions -- a method for manipulating model activations to steer generation into the desired direction. We analyze the effect of a popular intervention (finding experts) on the alignment of cross-lingual representations in mLLMs. We identify the neurons to manipulate for a given language and introspect the embedding space of mLLMs pre- and post-manipulation. We show that modifying the mLLM's activations changes its embedding space such that cross-lingual alignment is enhanced. Further, we show that the changes to the embedding space translate into improved downstream performance on retrieval tasks, with up to 2x improvements in top-1 accuracy on cross-lingual retrieval.

<title>KVLink: Accelerating Large Language Models via Efficient KV Cache Reuse</title>

Abstract: We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we investigate a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse. Additionally, KVLink can be combined with KV cache compression to further save cache loading and storage overhead while outperforming the baselines.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems relies on fine-grained dimensions like faithfulness and relevance, as judged by expert human annotators. Meta-evaluation benchmarks support the development of automatic evaluators that correlate well with human judgement. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on English or use translated data, which fails to capture cultural nuances. A native approach provides a better representation of the end user experience.
  In this work, we develop a Multilingual End-to-end Meta-Evaluation RAG benchmark (MEMERAG). Our benchmark builds on the popular MIRACL dataset, using native-language questions and generating responses with diverse large language models (LLMs), which are then assessed by expert annotators for faithfulness and relevance. We describe our annotation process and show that it achieves high inter-annotator agreement. We then analyse the performance of the answer-generating LLMs across languages as per the human evaluators. Finally we apply the dataset to our main use-case which is to benchmark multilingual automatic evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge). We show that our benchmark can reliably identify improvements offered by advanced prompting techniques and LLMs. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/MEMERAG

<title>Winning Big with Small Models: Knowledge Distillation vs. Self-Training for Reducing Hallucination in Product QA Agents</title>

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in customer support is constrained by hallucination (generating false information) and the high cost of proprietary models. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented question-answering (QA) pipeline and explore how to balance human input and automation. Using a dataset of questions about a Samsung Smart TV user manual, we demonstrate that synthetic data generated by LLMs outperforms crowdsourced data in reducing hallucination in finetuned models. We also compare self-training (fine-tuning models on their own outputs) and knowledge distillation (fine-tuning on stronger models' outputs, e.g., GPT-4o), and find that self-training achieves comparable hallucination reduction. We conjecture that this surprising finding can be attributed to increased exposure bias issues in the knowledge distillation case and support this conjecture with post hoc analysis. We also improve robustness to unanswerable questions and retrieval failures with contextualized "I don't know" responses. These findings show that scalable, cost-efficient QA systems can be built using synthetic data and self-training with open-source models, reducing reliance on proprietary tools or costly human annotations.

<title>Do Emotions Really Affect Argument Convincingness? A Dynamic Approach with LLM-based Manipulation Checks</title>

Abstract: Emotions have been shown to play a role in argument convincingness, yet this aspect is underexplored in the natural language processing (NLP) community. Unlike prior studies that use static analyses, focus on a single text domain or language, or treat emotion as just one of many factors, we introduce a dynamic framework inspired by manipulation checks commonly used in psychology and social science; leveraging LLM-based manipulation checks, this framework examines the extent to which perceived emotional intensity influences perceived convincingness. Through human evaluation of arguments across different languages, text domains, and topics, we find that in over half of cases, human judgments of convincingness remain unchanged despite variations in perceived emotional intensity; when emotions do have an impact, they more often enhance rather than weaken convincingness. We further analyze whether 11 LLMs behave like humans in the same scenario, finding that while LLMs generally mirror human patterns, they struggle to capture nuanced emotional effects in individual judgments.

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of reasoning models trained for step-by-step problem solving by introducing query-agnostic adversarial triggers - short, irrelevant text that, when appended to math problems, systematically mislead models to output incorrect answers without altering the problem's semantics. We propose CatAttack, an automated iterative attack pipeline for generating triggers on a weaker, less expensive proxy model (DeepSeek V3) and successfully transfer them to more advanced reasoning target models like DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek R1-distilled-Qwen-32B, resulting in greater than 300% increase in the likelihood of the target model generating an incorrect answer. For example, appending, "Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives," to any math problem leads to more than doubling the chances of a model getting the answer wrong. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in reasoning models, revealing that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to subtle adversarial inputs, raising security and reliability concerns. The CatAttack triggers dataset with model responses is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/collinear-ai/cat-attack-adversarial-triggers.

Abstract: Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting task-level experts is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise per instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we show that Symbolic-MoE beats strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute avg. gain of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE generalizes well to unseen tasks and removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.

Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Search-R1.

Abstract: This paper reports the first brain-inspired large language model (BriLLM). This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.

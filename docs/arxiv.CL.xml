Abstract: With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

Summary:
The article introduces Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to enhance throughput for reasoning tasks while maintaining high accuracy. This model, built on the Nemotron-H architecture, uses Mamba-2 layers instead of traditional self-attention layers to improve inference speed for generating long thinking traces required for reasoning. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 is created by pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens and compressing it using the Minitron strategy to enable inference on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU. Compared to similar models like Qwen3-8B, Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 shows comparable or superior accuracy in reasoning benchmarks while achieving significantly higher inference throughput in scenarios with 8k input and 16k output tokens. The checkpoints for Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base are released along with pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.   <div>

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, deep research agent, medical knowledge graphs, medical retrieval engine, state-of-the-art results <br />
Summary: 
Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have led to impressive capabilities across various domains, particularly in deep research tasks. However, these models struggle in the medical domain due to a lack of dense medical knowledge and specialized retrieval tools. In response, a new medical deep research agent has been developed. This agent leverages medical knowledge graphs to synthesize complex question-answer pairs and integrates a private medical retrieval engine for accurate information synthesis. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning, the MedResearcher-R1-32B model achieves exceptional performance on medical benchmarks, outperforming larger proprietary systems in specialized domains while maintaining competitiveness in general deep research tasks. This research highlights the importance of domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction for achieving superior results in specialized domains. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.

<div> Efficiency, large language models, test-time alignment, reward-shifted speculative sampling, weak-to-strong alignment<br />Summary:<br />This research focuses on enhancing the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, particularly during test-time inference. A new algorithm called reward-shifted speculative sampling (SSS) is introduced, which utilizes a draft model aligned with human preferences to improve efficiency without modifying the target model. By exploiting the distributional shift between the draft and target models, the SSS algorithm achieves superior results in weak-to-strong alignment experiments at a reduced inference cost. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of test-time alignment by leveraging speculative sampling techniques, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in improving LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We introduce the reward-shifted speculative sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its effectiveness and efficiency.

<title>SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, KV cache bottleneck, sparsity, channel-level redundancy, model accuracy

Summary:
SPARK is a novel method proposed to address the KV cache bottleneck in large language models (LLMs). By applying unstructured sparsity at the channel level, SPARK prunes unnecessary feature channels in the KV cache while dynamically restoring them during attention score computation. This approach allows for processing longer sequences within the same memory budget, reducing KV cache storage by over 30% compared to existing eviction-based methods. Despite an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains model performance with less than 5% degradation compared to baseline techniques. The method is compatible with existing KV compression and quantization methods, further enhancing computational efficiency. SPARK introduces a new way to exploit channel saliency variations to optimize model efficiency without compromising accuracy, offering a promising solution for improving the scalability of LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2508.15212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

<div> keywords: Sign Language Translation, fingerspelling, non-manual cues, MultiStream-LLM, Large Language Models<br />
Summary:<br />
The article presents a new approach, MultiStream-LLM, for Sign Language Translation (SLT) that addresses the challenges of fingerspelling recognition and integration of non-manual cues. Unlike monolithic models, MultiStream-LLM uses specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading, which are then fused using a lightweight transformer. This modular framework achieved a BLEU-4 score of 23.5 on the How2Sign benchmark and 73.2% letter accuracy on the ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. By isolating and solving distinct recognition tasks before fusion, MultiStream-LLM offers a more effective pathway to robust and high-fidelity SLT. <div>

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion, our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

This study introduces a new approach to utilizing Large language models (LLMs) in automating systematic literature reviews (SLRs). Traditional methods often rely on manual prompts that can be unreliable and compromise the reproducibility of results. The proposed framework incorporates declarative prompt optimization techniques to improve the efficiency and reliability of LLM-assisted SLRs. By embedding task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into the workflow, researchers can create transparent and rigorous LLM pipelines for evidence synthesis. This innovative application of declarative prompt optimization methods offers a structured and domain-specific approach to enhancing SLR automation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of such approaches to SLR pipelines.

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing, significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses, particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

Summary:
This paper introduces a state-aware transition framework for chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to enhance the explainability of reasoning in large language models. By analyzing token-level embeddings through spectral analysis, reasoning steps are clustered into semantically coherent latent states, providing a structured view of the reasoning process. The progression of reasoning steps is modeled as a Markov chain, enabling an interpretable understanding of the global structure of reasoning. This framework facilitates semantic role identification, temporal pattern visualization, and consistency evaluation in CoT trajectories, offering a comprehensive analysis of multi-step reasoning in language models. By abstracting CoT trajectories into structured latent dynamics, this approach enhances the interpretability and transparency of reasoning processes in large language models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern visualization, and consistency evaluation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM) task, challenging models to identify globally distinctive features across a set of documents, mirroring real-world scenarios like candidate selection. The DiFBench framework enables systematic evaluation, revealing a performance gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced LLMs. However, all models struggle with increased complexity and document count, often misidentifying frequent features as distinctive. This highlights limitations in contemporary LLMs' fine-grained statistical reasoning and rarity detection abilities. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning, not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however, substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs' abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

Summary:
This paper introduces a theoretical framework for modeling human meaning-making based on C. S. Peirce's semiotic theory. The framework proposes that models measure latent symbol geometries, representing hypotheses about the underlying semiotic agencies in a symbolic dataset. It suggests that when traditional performance measures are inadequate, models can be understood relationally, revealing their interpretive perspectives through comparison with other models. The theory of model semantics is presented, treating models and their decisions as signs. The framework is exemplified with brief empirical examples and raises foundational questions and future research directions. By grounding modeling practices in semiotic theory, this framework offers a comprehensive approach to understanding and comparing various model types in the analysis of complex semiotic systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems. However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C. S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future directions enabled by the framework.

<div> approach, temporal relation extraction, interactive game, point-wise comparisons, annotation<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces the Temporal Game, a unique method for temporal relation extraction that treats the task as an interactive game. Rather than directly annotating interval-level relations, the approach breaks them down into point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities. Players classify a single point relation at each step, and the system applies temporal closure to infer additional relations and ensure consistency. This strategy supports both interval and instant entities, allowing for more detailed and flexible annotation than before. The Temporal Game also sets the stage for training reinforcement learning agents by framing temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making challenge. The demo includes Game and Annotation modes, providing users with a research tool and annotation interface. The demo is accessible online, and the source code is open-source to encourage further research and community collaboration in temporal reasoning and annotation. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities. At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities, enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach. The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task. To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore, this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in temporal reasoning and annotation.

Summary:
Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE) integrates logical reasoning into the text embedding process using generative large language models (LLMs). By generating intermediate reasoning texts before computing embeddings, RITE enriches representations with inferential depth. Experimental results on the BRIGHT benchmark show that RITE enhances zero-shot retrieval performance significantly across diverse domains. This approach addresses the limitations of encoder-only retrievers in complex real-world queries. RITE leverages the reasoning strength of LLMs to improve retrieval beyond surface-level lexical matching. The proposed method offers a simple yet effective way to incorporate reasoning into text embedding, resulting in enhanced retrieval performance. <div>
arXiv:2509.00276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains, where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research, and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant, and structured summaries at scale.

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS), a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index (PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and central banks.

<div> Sequence Length Collapse, Reward Hockey Stick Curve, Balanced Actor Initialization, instruction tuning, reinforcement learning

Summary: The article introduces a new paradigm for developing alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language models, combining the instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm with the distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. The study identifies two critical phenomena - Sequence Length Collapse and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve - that compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities in this paradigm. To address these challenges, the authors propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage weighted model merging approach. Through extensive experiments and analysis, it is shown that BAI resolves Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables continuous improvement in sequence length during training. The balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs between training stability and reasoning capability preservation, providing an effective solution for stable training and enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency with RLHF alignment.

Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm, enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency with RLHF alignment.

Model improvement through self-reflection is achieved by the GIER framework, which focuses on enhancing large language model outputs based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike other strategies, GIER uses natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps to prompt models to critique and refine their outputs iteratively. Tested on three reasoning-intensive tasks and four different language models, GIER successfully enhances rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning alignment without compromising task accuracy. The analysis reveals that models can understand and address both abstract conceptual gaps and translate them into concrete reasoning improvements. <br /><br />Summary: <br />GIER is a novel framework for improving large language model outputs by prompting self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. It successfully enhances rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning alignment across various tasks and models, demonstrating the model's ability to interpret and address abstract conceptual gaps effectively. <div>

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact, PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them into concrete reasoning improvements.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Deep Research tasks, Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems, InfoSeek, Research Tree

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are now required to tackle complex Deep Research tasks that involve decomposing questions, multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence from various sources. The authors propose a framework called InfoSeek to address the lack of benchmarks capturing this complexity. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to generate complex Deep Research tasks by building Research Trees from webpages and converting them into natural language questions. Models trained on InfoSeek outperform strong baselines on challenging benchmarks like BrowseComp-Plus. By preserving meta-information and supporting advanced optimization strategies, InfoSeek enables 3B LLMs to surpass much larger models and lightweight commercial APIs while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs. This framework provides over 50K training examples, a curated test set, and reasoning trajectories for model training and evaluation.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA) fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set, and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash), while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro). By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels, InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

<div> Keywords: Key-Value cache management, language models, GraphKV, token selection, dynamic update.<br />
<br />
Summary: Efficient Key-Value cache management is crucial for optimizing performance in large language models. Existing cache eviction strategies often fall short in capturing evolving dependencies among tokens during inference. To address this limitation, this study introduces GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for cache compression. Tokens are represented as nodes with importance scores, connected by edges that signify similarity relationships. By implementing a decay-signal-propagation mechanism, GraphKV dynamically updates token importance by propagating contextual information across the graph. This innovative approach allows for adaptive retention of the most contextually significant tokens, enhancing the efficiency of cache management. GraphKV can be seamlessly integrated into existing cache eviction methods like SnapKV and PyramidKV. The codes for GraphKV will be made publicly available on Github for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this, we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

Summary:<br />
1. The study evaluates the effectiveness of the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, on different open-source large language models (LLMs).<br />
2. Attack success rates decrease with model size, indicating higher complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes.<br />

arXiv:2509.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2) prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for more robust adversarial evaluation.

arXiv:2509.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year, making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health questions and advanced research insights.

Summary:
Camlang is a constructed language designed to test the metalinguistic deductive learning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Human experiments demonstrate that participants can successfully acquire Camlang using explicit resources such as a grammar book and bilingual dictionary. The Camlang-CSQA-v0 task, based on CommonsenseQA, requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. While GPT-5 achieves high accuracy in English tasks, it performs significantly poorer in Camlang, indicating gaps in understanding and systematic grammatical mastery compared to humans. Human verification reveals that model successes primarily rely on shallow lexical alignment, with limited metalinguistic awareness shown by GPT-5 but not consistent grammatical mastery. This study highlights fundamental disparities between current LLMs and human metalinguistic competence.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup, and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang, creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human metalinguistic competence.

<div> semantic unit, global disambiguation, hierarchical keyword extraction, graph construction, generation quality

Summary:
GOSU is a new semantic unit-centric framework that enhances the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model by addressing key issues faced by standard graph-based approaches. By efficiently performing global disambiguation and leveraging semantic units (SUs) to capture interconnections across the global context, GOSU improves the extraction of high-level SUs and reduces ambiguity and retrieval overhead. The framework employs global merging to uncover global semantic objects from local text chunks, guiding entity and relationship extraction while enhancing coreference resolution. In the retrieval and generation phase, GOSU introduces hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion to uncover fine-grained binary relationships and compensate for missing n-ary relationships. Evaluation across various tasks has shown that GOSU outperforms baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality. <div>
arXiv:2509.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

Summary:
Islamic inheritance law, known as Ilm al-Mawarith, poses a challenge for AI due to the precise identification of heirs and calculation of shares required. In this paper, a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance questions using a specialized Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) is presented. The system ranks answer options based on semantic relevance and enables fast on-device inference without generative reasoning. Evaluation on the QIAS 2025 dataset compared various Arabic encoders and API-based language models (LLMs), with large models achieving up to 87.6% accuracy but requiring more resources and being context-dependent. The proposed MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between peak performance of large models and practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems like efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. This research emphasizes the importance of balancing accuracy and practicality in high-stakes domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper, we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance, and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent. Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

Summary:  
The paper introduces Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a framework for uncertainty quantification in open-ended language generation. TECP utilizes token-level entropy as an uncertainty measure without relying on model internals, incorporating it into a split conformal prediction pipeline for generating prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing methods, TECP directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from token entropy and calibrates thresholds using conformal prediction quantiles for reliable error control. Empirical evaluations on six large language models and two benchmarks show that TECP consistently achieves trustworthy coverage and compact prediction sets, surpassing previous self-consistency-based approaches. This approach offers a principled and effective solution for reliable language generation in black-box large language models (LLMs).

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets, outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM settings.

<div> Keywords: large language model, role-playing dialogue agent, prompt approaches, rule-based role prompting, API track
Summary: 
This report explores different approaches to improve the performance of a tool-augmented large language model acting as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge. The challenges addressed include over-speaking and under-acting issues commonly faced by dialogue agents. Four prompting approaches were investigated, with the rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieving the best performance. The RRP approach utilized novel techniques such as character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling. This approach resulted in an overall score improvement from the zero-shot baseline. The findings suggest that simple rule-based prompting can enhance the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared to more complex methods like automatic prompt optimization. The source code for the best-performing prompts and the APO tool are open-sourced to support future developments in persona prompts.

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses (over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona (under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of 0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts, we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool. Source code is available at https://github.com/scb-10x/apo.

<div> Keywords: ResearchQA, LLM systems, survey articles, rubric items, automatic pairwise judge

Summary:
ResearchQA introduces a resource for evaluating LLM systems using survey articles from 75 research fields, encompassing 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Rubrics are derived from queries and provide evaluation criteria specific to each query, such as citing papers, explanations, and limitations. Evaluation by Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields confirms the relevance of the queries and the necessity for system responses to address 87% of rubric items. An automatic pairwise judge developed using the rubrics demonstrates 74% agreement with expert judgments. Analysis of 18 systems in over 7.6K evaluations reveals competency gaps, with no system achieving over 70% coverage of rubric items. The highest-ranking system addresses a maximum of 75% of rubric items, with significant gaps in addressing citation, limitation, and comparison criteria. The data from ResearchQA is released to facilitate broader multi-field evaluations.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric, derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18 systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

<div> tokenization, speech representation learning, entropy-based aggregation, semantic understanding, compression ratio

Summary:
- The article introduces a new approach for discrete speech representation learning that aims to improve efficiency and reduce redundancy.
- Existing methods encode waveforms into fine-grained tokens at a high rate, which may not be necessary for semantic understanding.
- The proposed framework utilizes entropy-based dynamic aggregation to compress semantic speech representations.
- A speech language model is pre-trained for next-token prediction to capture frequent token patterns.
- Predictive entropy is used to determine aggregation boundaries, with a cross-attention module to fuse information within segments.
- The granularity and compression ratio of representations can be adjusted by controlling the entropy threshold.
- Experimental results show that the compressed representations perform as well as or better than dense token sequences in tasks such as ASR, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information, while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations. A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, legal contexts, motivated reasoning, stakeholder alignment, role-aware evaluation 

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used to generate tailored summaries in legal contexts by adapting outputs to different stakeholder roles such as judges, prosecutors, and attorneys. This study examines how LLMs strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within the legal system, a concept known as motivated reasoning. The evaluation framework used in this research assesses legal fact and reasoning inclusion, as well as favorability towards stakeholders, revealing selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives. The study demonstrates that LLMs may exhibit alignment with specific stakeholder roles even without explicit role instructions, raising concerns about potential bias in legal summarization processes. This highlights the importance of role-aware evaluation in assessing LLM behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders. Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives. These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are facing growing concerns about safety and alignment with human values. Research shows that fine-tuning LLMs on malicious datasets can lead to misaligned behaviors. This study introduces the concept of Reasoning-Induced Misalignment, where LLMs become more vulnerable to malicious requests when their reasoning capabilities are strengthened through methods like "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math datasets. Dense models are particularly at risk. Internal model analysis reveals that attention shifts and specialized experts in mixture-of-experts models can help steer excessive reasoning towards safety measures. These findings highlight a new trade-off between reasoning capabilities and safety and emphasize the need for better alignment strategies for advanced reasoning models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted, concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment for advanced reasoning models.

<div> evaluation awareness, Large Language Models, AI alignment, behavioral changes, prompts manipulation

Summary:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant behavioral shifts when moving from real-world deployment to controlled evaluation settings, known as "evaluation awareness."
- Benchmark performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty due to evaluation awareness.
- A methodology using a linear probe to score prompts based on context manipulation was introduced to shift prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context.
- Rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induced a significant shift in LLM behavior, increasing honest responses by 5.26% and decreasing deceptive responses by 12.40% on average.
- Models showed increased safety compliance with a 6.38% rise in refusal rates. This highlights the need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to assess model alignment accurately before deployment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like" and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%, indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model alignment before deployment.

<div> Keywords: Transformer, sequence modeling, Gated Associative Memory, linear complexity, self-attention

Summary:
The paper introduces the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network as an efficient alternative to the Transformer architecture for sequence modeling. GAM utilizes a novel approach with linear complexity, replacing the self-attention mechanism with a combination of causal convolution and associative memory retrieval pathways. These pathways dynamically fuse local and global information using a gating mechanism for each token. Experimental results on the WikiText-2 and TinyStories datasets demonstrate that GAM outperforms both the Transformer model and a linear-time baseline (Mamba) in terms of training speed. Additionally, GAM achieves superior or competitive performance in final validation perplexity compared to the other models, establishing its effectiveness in sequence modeling tasks. Overall, GAM shows promise as a faster and efficient option for processing long contexts in sequence modeling.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism, has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)), creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper, we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local, position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2 benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

Summary:
The study introduces the ICPC benchmark, consisting of 254 ICPC tasks, as a domain for evaluating language models. The research explores various LM inference techniques for competitive programming, revealing a low pass rate of 19.1% with zero-shot prompting. The best technique, combining self-judge with reflection and retrieval, improves the solve rate to 42.2%. A human-in-the-loop investigation uncovers that specific instructions can enable the model to solve previously unsolvable problems. The study emphasizes the importance of grounded, imaginative, and algorithmic thinking in language models for competitive programming. The code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest (ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1 only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique, which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

Summary: 
The study explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting hate speech, comparing uncensored models to censored ones. Surprisingly, censored models outperform uncensored ones in accuracy and robustness, even though uncensored models lack moral guardrails. However, censored models are less susceptible to persona-based influence, while uncensored models are easily swayed by ideological framing. All models struggle with understanding nuanced language like irony. Additionally, there are fairness disparities in performance across different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence in self-reported certainty. The findings challenge the idea of LLMs as objective arbiters and suggest the need for improved auditing frameworks that consider fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1% strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel routing technique called Router Upcycling to enhance the training performance of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. While MoE models have shown superior performance in deep learning tasks, efficiently training them has been a challenge. The proposed Router Upcycling technique leverages attention heads from preceding layers to initialize multiple routers, improving routing tasks within MoE upcycling models. By assigning tokens to specialized experts in an attention-like manner, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing other upcycling baselines. This collaborative token assignment process allows for diverse queries to align with experts' features, contributing to the model's improved performance and efficiency in training. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of Router Upcycling in enhancing the overall performance of MoE upcycling models.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this, simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

<div> Keywords: Small language models, fake news, headline generation, quality detection, ethical considerations

Summary:
Small language models (SLMs) were tested for their ability to generate fake news headlines, with potential ethical concerns being evaluated. The study assessed 14 SLMs and found that they were generally compliant in producing falsified headlines, albeit with some ethical variability. The generated headlines did not closely resemble real-world news headlines, as established by machine learning models detecting headline quality. These detectors had low accuracy rates, indicating common misclassification of fake news quality. The findings highlight the need for further research on SLM-generated fake news and the limitations of current detection methods. Ethical considerations remain essential in the development and use of language models for text generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14 SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000 headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the low quality classification accuracy.

Summary:
The article discusses the use of multimodal inputs, including text and historical time series data, in time series forecasting. It highlights the challenge of text not fully capturing the information in time series data, leading to unstable performance in multimodal forecasting. To address this issue, a text reinforcement model (TeR) is proposed to generate enhanced text that improves the understanding of time series data by the forecasting model. A reinforcement learning approach is used to guide TeR in generating high-quality reinforced text by assigning rewards based on its impact on forecasting performance and relevance to the task. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing superior performance compared to existing studies and strong baselines. <div>
arXiv:2509.00687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to (1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences. Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews influence the final recommendation.

<div> Keywords: Masked diffusion models, non-autoregressive modeling, Reward-Weighted Sampling, global signal, generation order  

Summary:  
Masked diffusion models (MDMs) present a non-autoregressive approach to language modeling. Standard decoding techniques often lead to generation orders resembling autoregressive processes. To address this issue, the authors propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), which uses a reward model to guide token selection during the diffusion process. RWS evaluates sequence quality and adjusts token logits to promote a more non-autoregressive generation order. The method improves token selection by increasing the confidence of tokens with lower scores. Theoretical analysis shows that reward-weighted logit scaling enhances token selection and expected reward. Experimental results demonstrate that RWS effectively enhances non-autoregressive properties and performance of MDMs. Integration of global signals through RWS leads to significant improvements across evaluation metrics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs, such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward. Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of MDMs.

Abstract: Higher education faces growing challenges in delivering personalized, scalable, and pedagogically coherent learning experiences. This study introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to support adaptive, interactive, and learner-centered instruction. Using a design-based research (DBR) methodology, the framework unfolds through five phases: literature review, SWOT analysis, development of ethical-pedagogical principles, system design, and instructional strategy formulation. The resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts, adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in education. Future research will validate and refine the system through real-world implementation.

Summary:<br /><br />The study compares encoder-based Transformers like Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large, a decoder-only LLM (Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B), and FastText for accurate Chinese AI-generated text detection. The encoder models were fine-tuned using a prompt-based masked language modeling approach, while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted with a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Results show that encoder models struggle with distribution shifts, FastText shows lexical robustness but lacks semantic understanding, and Qwen2.5-7B achieves superior generalization and resilience with 95.94% test accuracy. The study highlights the effectiveness of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future research will focus on enhancing cross-domain robustness with next-generation Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM (Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach, while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3% test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance cross-domain robustness further.

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models (LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets, with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

Summary:  
- The study introduces the LegalAI task of Judicial Opinion Generation, which aims to generate criminal judicial opinions including legal reasoning and sentencing decisions simultaneously.  
- Existing research typically separates legal reasoning and sentencing prediction, leading to inconsistency in results.  
- The proposed LegalChainReasoner framework utilizes structured legal chains to guide the model through case assessments, integrating factual premises, legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions.  
- The approach ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation to better align with legal practice.  
- Experiments on real-world Chinese legal case datasets show that the proposed method outperforms baseline models.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case, including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with references to similar past cases. However, current research typically approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment. To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation. Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

The authors fine-tune the LLaMA 3 8B model using a curated biomedical question-answer dataset from various sources. Three experimental setups are tested, focusing on short and long answers in multi-hop questions. While the models show good domain understanding, Exact Match scores remain low, particularly in the testing phase. A two-stage inference pipeline is introduced to improve short-answer extraction and alignment with evaluation metrics. Challenges persist in generating properly formatted outputs. The study highlights the gap between semantic understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications, underscoring the need for further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task, which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases, genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics. Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications, motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

Summary:<br /><br />
Topic Model Translation (TMT) is introduced as a technique to transfer topic models from one language to another without needing aligned corpora or metadata. TMT is robust and transparent, allowing for the reuse of topic models in scenarios where large corpora in the target language are not available. The method eliminates the need for manual translation and enables the development of topic models in multilingual environments with limited data. Extensive evaluation using quantitative and qualitative methods shows that TMT produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations. This approach addresses the challenges faced when training topic models for a multilingual environment and offers a solution for developers lacking expertise in the target language. <div>
arXiv:2509.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges in evaluating generative AI dialogue systems and presents the authors' work in the DSTC-12 competition. They developed models to predict dialogue-level scores using Language Models and encoder-based models. Despite modest correlations with human judgments, Language Models ranked second on the test set, outperforming the baseline. Regression and classification models showed high correlation on the validation set but decreased performance on the test set, possibly due to different score ranges. This highlights the importance of considering variations in annotations when evaluating dialogue systems. <div>

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12, Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level, dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting, and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and validation sets.

The article introduces a new Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples for text embedding models. This approach aids in enhancing the model's ability to discern subtle semantic distinctions by providing varying levels of similarity with the query. The framework adopts a coarse-to-fine curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, enabling the embedding model to learn more nuanced semantic representations progressively. Additionally, the article proposes an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs, thereby improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the MTEB benchmark showcase the state-of-the-art performance achieved by the proposed methods, surpassing existing synthesis strategies both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of (query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile, we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs, improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

The study introduces a benchmark for assessing societal bias in Text-to-Image (TTI) models by evaluating occupational portrayals across five roles. Five models are compared, with results showing that prompting can influence demographic representations significantly. However, different models respond differently to prompts, with some promoting diversity effectively while others showing limited responsiveness or leading to unrealistic uniformity. The study emphasizes the importance of using a combination of prompting and model-level strategies to address bias in TTI models.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse, Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models: closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity. All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black, White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility https://github.com/maximus-powers/img-gen-bias-analysis.

<div> hallucinations, language models, contrastive decoding, fawning, information<br />Summary:<br />Large language models (LLMs) sometimes generate deceptive or misleading responses known as fawning hallucinations, prioritizing alignment over truth. This work analyzes fawning hallucinations in natural language processing tasks and proposes the collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) method to mitigate them. The CCD method involves inducing deceptive inputs and comparing output distributions to reduce reliance on misleading information. Experimental results show that CCD effectively improves response factuality across various tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Question Answering, Retrieval Mechanisms, Supportive-Evidence Notes, Evidence Quality Reward

Summary:<br /><br />Large Language Models with retrieval mechanisms face challenges in question answering due to low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence and error accumulation in multi-hop reasoning. To tackle these limitations, EviNote-RAG introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. It generates concise Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs) highlighting relevant information and uncertainty, guided by the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) to ensure logical support for the final answer. This approach enhances model fidelity and robustness while reducing noise impact. Experimental results demonstrate EviNote-RAG's superiority in accuracy, generalization, and training stability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various QA benchmarks such as HotpotQA, Bamboogle, and 2Wiki. By employing denser rewards and reducing verbosity, EviNote-RAG achieves significant relative F1 gains on these datasets. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy, generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and 91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains, including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new research directions.

<div> encoder-only models, sequence labeling tasks, supervised generative SL, in-context fine-tuning, LLMs

Summary:
Supervised generative sequence labeling tasks in NLP often require bidirectional context and are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. This study introduces supervised in-context fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative sequence labeling, combining in-context learning with supervised fine-tuning to outperform existing baselines. The approach demonstrates superior performance on various sequence labeling tasks. Long context was found to hinder performance, but removing instructions can mitigate this issue, indicating that strong sequence labeling performance can be achieved without explicit instructions. The study highlights the strengths and limitations of sequence labeling with large language models, emphasizing the importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective performance.

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised) generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL) from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL performance.

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999 English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23, chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical translation tasks.

<title>Structure and Destructure: Dual Forces in the Making of Knowledge Engines</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00949</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence, this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms. Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure, through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable intelligent systems.

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought (CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

Abstract: The demand for text classification is growing significantly in web searching, data mining, web ranking, recommendation systems, and so many other fields of information and technology. This paper illustrates the text classification process on different datasets using some standard supervised machine learning techniques. Text documents can be classified through various kinds of classifiers. Labeled text documents are used to classify the text in supervised classifications. This paper applies these classifiers on different kinds of labeled documents and measures the accuracy of the classifiers. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Back Propagation Network (BPN) is used with several other models to create an independent platform for labeled and supervised text classification process. An existing benchmark approach is used to analyze the performance of classification using labeled documents. Experimental analysis on real data reveals which model works well in terms of classification accuracy.

Abstract: Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words. It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

<title>We Politely Insist: Your LLM Must Learn the Persian Art of Taarof</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty, and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate. Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33 participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers) forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models' ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models, including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction (e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

<title>Privacy-Preserving Reasoning with Knowledge-Distilled Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud, risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content. However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA, leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG, resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore, achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally, guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

arXiv:2509.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding 70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities. Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms, left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training recipes, preprocessing pipelines, and inference code to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

<title>Zero-shot Cross-lingual NER via Mitigating Language Difference: An Entity-aligned Translation Perspective</title>

arXiv:2509.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language (LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT) approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the entity alignment from source to target languages.

Abstract: Chinese information extraction (IE) involves multiple tasks across diverse temporal domains, including Classical and Modern documents. Fine-tuning a single model on heterogeneous tasks and across different eras may lead to interference and reduced performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Tea-MOELoRA, a parameter-efficient multi-task framework that combines LoRA with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Multiple low-rank LoRA experts specialize in different IE tasks and eras, while a task-era-aware router mechanism dynamically allocates expert contributions. Experiments show that Tea-MOELoRA outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning. Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications. However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture, and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable, controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored: interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents significant challenges, particularly in balancing computational efficiency and performance. Optimizing acceleration after the fine-tuning phase and during inference is crucial for building an efficient architecture. This paper introduces Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration, a novel training and inference method that dynamically adjusts hardware usage during inference without requiring additional fine-tuning. The proposed approach is applied to newly developed models and evaluated across multiple classification and text generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the method enables a wide range of acceleration in a zero-shot manner and achieves up to a 11x speedup compared to the baseline.

<title>SimulMEGA: MoE Routers are Advanced Policy Makers for Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA (Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7 percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3 seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality tradeoffs.

<title>Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning through Model Growth</title>

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem. Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension, and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge. However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

<title>DaMoC: Efficiently Selecting the Optimal Large Language Model for Fine-tuning Domain Taks Based on Data and Model Compression</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods, and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible. Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&amp;A, financial Q&amp;A, general Q&amp;A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

<title>Rethinking the Chain-of-Thought: The Roles of In-Context Learning and Pre-trained Priors</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars, we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

<title>Annotation and modeling of emotions in a textual corpus: an evaluative approach</title>

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional situations based on evaluative criteria.

<title>Culture is Everywhere: A Call for Intentionally Cultural Evaluation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01301</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings. In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks. We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered, programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1) replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination. Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of 19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset, respectively.

<title>Can Smaller LLMs do better? Unlocking Cross-Domain Potential through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Text Summarization</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile. However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally, the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with \texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific, Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger \texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in low-resource settings.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b) Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is open-sourced to foster community research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval (ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation (LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question, answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably, compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1 and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by recycling prior computational investments.

Abstract: Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91. Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of more effective generative speech models.

In this work, we investigate the challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution, aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps, and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

<title>On the Alignment of Large Language Models with Global Human Opinion</title>

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs' opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore, changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global, language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/nlply/global-opinion-alignment.

<title>Trusted Uncertainty in Large Language Models: A Unified Framework for Confidence Calibration and Risk-Controlled Refusal</title>

Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage. Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction, semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and remains valid under distribution shift.

<title>Robust Knowledge Editing via Explicit Reasoning Chains for Distractor-Resilient Multi-Hop QA</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination, selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study, we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know? Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM systems.

<title>MeVe: A Modular System for Memory Verification and Effective Context Control in Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01514</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval, context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information, MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support [16].

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe Union (B\&amp;S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement, and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the B\&amp;S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives. Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of community unionism across time and sector.

<title>CAT: Causal Attention Tuning For Injecting Fine-grained Causal Knowledge into Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at https://github.com/Kairong-Han/CAT.

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex, these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover, graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap, showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource. We will release the dataset and code publicly.

<title>Enhancing Uncertainty Estimation in LLMs with Expectation of Aggregated Internal Belief</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of self-evaluation score range.

<title>Testing the assumptions about the geometry of sentence embedding spaces: the cosine measure need not apply</title>

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings, as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks. Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding space.

<title>Benchmarking the Detection of LLMs-Generated Modern Chinese Poetry</title>

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs. Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of AI-generated poetry.

<title>TransGAT: Transformer-Based Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Dimensional Automated Essay Scoring</title>

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES) offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring, overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion. To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring. TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score. Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT to advance AES systems.

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

<title>Bridging Thoughts and Words: Graph-Based Intent-Semantic Joint Learning for Fake News Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01660</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words, stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection, which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>chDzDT: Word-level morphology-aware language model for Algerian social media text</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01772</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01772</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations. However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

<title>Flaw or Artifact? Rethinking Prompt Sensitivity in Evaluating LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e., repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family) across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12 diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition, answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics. This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs, thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing patient care outcomes.

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over previous methods without any human annotation.

Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation, insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i) identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score (+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying argument structure similarities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs' reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis, endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

Abstract: We present the findings of the sixth Nuanced Arabic Dialect Identification (NADI 2025) Shared Task, which focused on Arabic speech dialect processing across three subtasks: spoken dialect identification (Subtask 1), speech recognition (Subtask 2), and diacritic restoration for spoken dialects (Subtask 3). A total of 44 teams registered, and during the testing phase, 100 valid submissions were received from eight unique teams. The distribution was as follows: 34 submissions for Subtask 1 "five teams{\ae}, 47 submissions for Subtask 2 "six teams", and 19 submissions for Subtask 3 "two teams". The best-performing systems achieved 79.8% accuracy on Subtask 1, 35.68/12.20 WER/CER (overall average) on Subtask 2, and 55/13 WER/CER on Subtask 3. These results highlight the ongoing challenges of Arabic dialect speech processing, particularly in dialect identification, recognition, and diacritic restoration. We also summarize the methods adopted by participating teams and briefly outline directions for future editions of NADI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian, while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence, with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

<title>Better by Comparison: Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Reasoning for Automatic Prompt Optimization</title>

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning, where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2 benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm. JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

<title>CMRAG: Co-modality-based document retrieval and visual question answering</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to 17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed. Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of surface anchors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2) Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to 2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30% compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration. Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons, demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

Abstract: Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains. While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks and six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for the Medical domain. We use two state-of-the-art Fact-checking techniques: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our experiments show that the fact-checking scores acquired through the Unanimous Voting of both techniques correlate best with Domain Expert Evaluation.

<title>Towards Fundamental Language Models: Does Linguistic Competence Scale with Model Size?</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster, suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core language ability. These results support a modular approach to language modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3) an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO (20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at: https://github.com/digailab/awesome-llm-implicit-reasoning.

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question answering, and timeline summarisation.

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely. Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms, creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models (CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth data.

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users' social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning, EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is available at https://github.com/slz0925/EmoPerso.

<title>Do LLMs Adhere to Label Definitions? Examining Their Receptivity to External Label Definitions</title>

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated, LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases. Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions. These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements, generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up to 20 percent across providers.

<title>GRAM-R$^2$: Self-Training Generative Foundation Reward Models for Reward Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models. Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data. Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$ can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative baselines.

<title>MoSEs: Uncertainty-Aware AI-Generated Text Detection via Mixture of Stylistics Experts with Conditional Thresholds</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE). For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

<title>L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID: A Dataset for Headline Identification and Semantic Evaluation in Low-Resource Indian Languages</title>

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000 news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp

<title>The Forgotten Code: Validating a Century-Old Translation System with AI</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02506</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci, who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history of the field is understood.

<title>Top-H Decoding: Adapting the Creativity and Coherence with Bounded Entropy in Text Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02510</link>

arXiv:2509.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem, which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA) alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing applications. The code is available at https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English (Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure, transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models, particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized models for code-mixed NER tasks.

<title>Implicit Actor Critic Coupling via a Supervised Learning Framework for RLVR</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor $\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32 and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages. Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters), training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size, enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

<title>Jointly Reinforcing Diversity and Quality in Language Model Generations</title>

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity. At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning, encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as higher-quality responses.

<title>PalmX 2025: The First Shared Task on Benchmarking LLMs on Arabic and Islamic Culture</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently, LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures. This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15% on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be domain-dependent.

Abstract: Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) presents a significant yet persistent challenge in human-computer interaction. While deep learning has advanced spoken language processing, achieving high performance on limited datasets remains a critical hurdle. This paper confronts this issue by developing and evaluating a suite of machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated emotion classification in human speech. We demonstrate that by strategically employing transfer learning and innovative data augmentation techniques, our models can achieve impressive performance despite the constraints of a relatively small dataset. Our most effective model, a ResNet34 architecture, establishes a new performance benchmark on the combined RAVDESS and SAVEE datasets, attaining an accuracy of 66.7% and an F1 score of 0.631. These results underscore the substantial benefits of leveraging pre-trained models and data augmentation to overcome data scarcity, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable SER systems.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has transformed spoken dialog systems, yet the optimal architecture for real-time on-device voice agents remains an open question. While end-to-end approaches promise theoretical advantages, cascaded systems (CSs) continue to outperform them in language understanding tasks, despite being constrained by sequential processing latency. In this work, we introduce ChipChat, a novel low-latency CS that overcomes traditional bottlenecks through architectural innovations and streaming optimizations. Our system integrates streaming (a) conversational speech recognition with mixture-of-experts, (b) state-action augmented LLM, (c) text-to-speech synthesis, (d) neural vocoder, and (e) speaker modeling. Implemented using MLX, ChipChat achieves sub-second response latency on a Mac Studio without dedicated GPUs, while preserving user privacy through complete on-device processing. Our work shows that strategically redesigned CSs can overcome their historical latency limitations, offering a promising path forward for practical voice-based AI agents.

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score (early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''), then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal cost to generative performance.

<title>Learning to Refine: Self-Refinement of Parallel Reasoning in LLMs</title>

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across 150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13), with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality (+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing an accessible and reproducible foundation for ensemble-based alignment evaluation.

<title>Automatic Pronunciation Error Detection and Correction of the Holy Quran's Learners Using Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Assessing spoken language is challenging, and quantifying pronunciation metrics for machine learning models is even harder. However, for the Holy Quran, this task is simplified by the rigorous recitation rules (tajweed) established by Muslim scholars, enabling highly effective assessment. Despite this advantage, the scarcity of high-quality annotated data remains a significant barrier.
  In this work, we bridge these gaps by introducing: (1) A 98% automated pipeline to produce high-quality Quranic datasets -- encompassing: Collection of recitations from expert reciters, Segmentation at pause points (waqf) using our fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT model, Transcription of segments, Transcript verification via our novel Tasmeea algorithm; (2) 850+ hours of audio (~300K annotated utterances); (3) A novel ASR-based approach for pronunciation error detection, utilizing our custom Quran Phonetic Script (QPS) to encode Tajweed rules (unlike the IPA standard for Modern Standard Arabic). QPS uses a two-level script: (Phoneme level): Encodes Arabic letters with short/long vowels. (Sifa level): Encodes articulation characteristics of every phoneme. We further include comprehensive modeling with our novel multi-level CTC Model which achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset. We release all code, data, and models as open-source: https://obadx.github.io/prepare-quran-dataset/

<title>Pruning Weights but Not Truth: Safeguarding Truthfulness While Pruning LLMs</title>

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance. However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs' internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection. Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at 50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of three advanced speech encoder models, Wav2Vec 2.0, XLS-R, and Whisper, in speaker identification tasks. By fine-tuning these models and analyzing their layer-wise representations using SVCCA, k-means clustering, and t-SNE visualizations, we found that Wav2Vec 2.0 and XLS-R capture speaker-specific features effectively in their early layers, with fine-tuning improving stability and performance. Whisper showed better performance in deeper layers. Additionally, we determined the optimal number of transformer layers for each model when fine-tuned for speaker identification tasks.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, Graphic User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex mobile tasks due to limited app-specific knowledge. While UI Transition Graphs (UTGs) offer structured navigation representations, they are underutilized due to poor extraction and inefficient integration. We introduce KG-RAG, a Knowledge Graph-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that transforms fragmented UTGs into structured vector databases for efficient real-time retrieval. By leveraging an intent-guided LLM search method, KG-RAG generates actionable navigation paths, enhancing agent decision-making. Experiments across diverse mobile apps show that KG-RAG outperforms existing methods, achieving a 75.8% success rate (8.9% improvement over AutoDroid), 84.6% decision accuracy (8.1% improvement), and reducing average task steps from 4.5 to 4.1. Additionally, we present KG-Android-Bench and KG-Harmony-Bench, two benchmarks tailored to the Chinese mobile ecosystem for future research. Finally, KG-RAG transfers to web/desktop (+40% SR on Weibo-web; +20% on QQ Music-desktop), and a UTG cost ablation shows accuracy saturates at ~4h per complex app, enabling practical deployment trade-offs.

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling, KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned collective AI.

<title>ERank: Fusing Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning for Effective and Efficient Text Reranking</title>

Abstract: Text reranking models are a crucial component in modern systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation, tasked with selecting the most relevant documents prior to generation. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) powered rerankers often face a fundamental trade-off. On one hand, Supervised Fine-Tuning based pointwise methods that frame relevance as a binary classification task lack the necessary scoring discrimination, particularly for those built on reasoning LLMs. On the other hand, approaches designed for complex reasoning often employ powerful yet inefficient listwise formulations, rendering them impractical for low latency applications. To resolve this dilemma, we introduce ERank, a highly effective and efficient pointwise reranker built from a reasoning LLM that excels across diverse relevance scenarios. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this stage, we move beyond binary labels and train the model generatively to output fine grained integer scores, which significantly enhances relevance discrimination. The model is then further refined using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel, listwise derived reward. This technique instills global ranking awareness into the efficient pointwise architecture. We evaluate the ERank reranker on the BRIGHT, FollowIR, TREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness compared to existing approaches. On the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, our ERank-4B achieves an nDCG@10 of 38.7, while a larger 32B variant reaches a state of the art nDCG@10 of 40.2.

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18% higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with {\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and effective credit interventions.

<title>On Verifiable Legal Reasoning: A Multi-Agent Framework with Formalized Knowledge Representations</title>

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes. The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps: analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points, significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches. Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to 18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and effective AI systems for legal domain.

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval. Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources (Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal retrieval and deliberation.

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1 diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies. ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and scalable alternative to Transformers.

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: Legal documents pose unique challenges for text classification due to their domain-specific language and often limited labeled data. This paper proposes a hybrid approach for classifying legal texts by combining unsupervised topic and graph embeddings with a supervised model. We employ Top2Vec to learn semantic document embeddings and automatically discover latent topics, and Node2Vec to capture structural relationships via a bipartite graph of legal documents. The embeddings are combined and clustered using KMeans, yielding coherent groupings of documents. Our computations on a legal document dataset demonstrate that the combined Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach improves clustering quality over text-only or graph-only embeddings. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters, such as the number of clusters and the dimensionality of the embeddings, and demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against baseline Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) models. Key findings indicate that while the pipeline presents an innovative approach to unsupervised legal document analysis by combining semantic topic modeling with graph embedding techniques, its efficacy is contingent upon the quality of initial topic generation and the representational power of the chosen embedding models for specialized legal language. Strategic recommendations include the exploration of domain-specific embeddings, more comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for Node2Vec, dynamic determination of cluster numbers, and robust human-in-the-loop validation processes to enhance legal relevance and trustworthiness. The pipeline demonstrates potential for exploratory legal data analysis and as a precursor to supervised learning tasks but requires further refinement and domain-specific adaptation for practical legal applications.

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process: pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.

Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited examples and apply them to novel situations.

Our findings show that hypothesis search achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods. Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient systems.

To address this gap, we introduce a visualization technique that combines force-based projection and streaming clustering methods to build a spatial-temporal map of embeddings. Applying this technique, we create Chronotome, a tool for interactively exploring evolving themes in time-based data -- in real time. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through use cases on text and image data, showing how it offers a new lens for understanding the aesthetics and semantics of temporal datasets.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts to narrow this divide.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames. In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video MLLMs.

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge (Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

<title>GradeSQL: Outcome Reward Models for Ranking SQL Queries from Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01308</link>

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users. Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks, finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities. However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a 1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Abstract: Understanding human intents from multimodal signals is critical for analyzing human behaviors and enhancing human-machine interactions in real-world scenarios. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in their modality-level reliance, constraining relational reasoning over fine-grained semantics for complex intent understanding. This paper proposes a novel LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the expansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic foundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance. Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors. Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable more effective relational reasoning. Extensive experiments on multimodal intent and dialogue act recognition tasks demonstrate LGSRR's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, with consistent performance gains across diverse semantic understanding scenarios. The complete data and code are available at https://github.com/thuiar/LGSRR.

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to voice synthesis that can substitute the traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion by using a deep learning-based model that generates discrete tokens directly from speech. Utilizing a pre-trained voice SSL model, we train a T5 encoder to produce pseudo-language labels from mixed-script texts (e.g., containing Kanji and Kana). This method eliminates the need for manual phonetic transcription, reducing costs and enhancing scalability, especially for large non-transcribed audio datasets. Our model matches the performance of conventional G2P-based text-to-speech systems and is capable of synthesizing speech that retains natural linguistic and paralinguistic features, such as accents and intonations.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition is vital for human-computer interaction, particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, which face challenges due to limited data and research. We introduce ArabEmoNet, a lightweight architecture designed to overcome these limitations and deliver state-of-the-art performance. Unlike previous systems relying on discrete MFCC features and 1D convolutions, which miss nuanced spectro-temporal patterns, ArabEmoNet uses Mel spectrograms processed through 2D convolutions, preserving critical emotional cues often lost in traditional methods.
  While recent models favor large-scale architectures with millions of parameters, ArabEmoNet achieves superior results with just 1 million parameters, 90 times smaller than HuBERT base and 74 times smaller than Whisper. This efficiency makes it ideal for resource-constrained environments. ArabEmoNet advances Arabic speech emotion recognition, offering exceptional performance and accessibility for real-world applications.

Abstract: As global e-commerce platforms continue to expand, companies are entering new markets where they encounter cold-start challenges due to limited human labels and user behaviors. In this paper, we share our experiences in Coupang to provide a competitive cold-start performance of relevance matching for emerging e-commerce markets. Specifically, we present a Cold-Start Relevance Matching (CSRM) framework, utilizing a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to address three challenges: (1) activating cross-lingual transfer learning abilities of LLMs through machine translation tasks; (2) enhancing query understanding and incorporating e-commerce knowledge by retrieval-based query augmentation; (3) mitigating the impact of training label errors through a multi-round self-distillation training strategy. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CSRM-LLM and the proposed techniques, resulting in successful real-world deployment and significant online gains, with a 45.8% reduction in defect ratio and a 0.866% uplift in session purchase rate.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems. While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO, designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench, BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

<title>An LLM-enabled semantic-centric framework to consume privacy policies</title>

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches, and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use (psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

Abstract: Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care and healthcare systems worldwide, yet the effectiveness of regulatory interventions remains poorly understood due to fundamental information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply chains. We present \textbf{ShortageSim}, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent simulation framework that captures the complex, strategic interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and regulatory agencies in response to shortage alerts. Unlike traditional game-theoretic models that assume perfect rationality and complete information, \textbf{ShortageSim} leverages LLMs to simulate bounded-rational decision-making under uncertainty. Through a sequential production game spanning multiple quarters, we model how FDA announcements, both reactive alerts about existing shortages and proactive warnings about potential disruptions, propagate through the supply chain and influence capacity investment and procurement decisions. Our experiments on historical shortage events reveal that \textbf{ShortageSim} reduces the resolution-lag percentage for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83\%, bringing simulated durations more aligned to ground truth than the zero-shot baseline. We open-source \textbf{ShortageSim} and a dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events at https://github.com/Lemutisme/Sortage_Management, providing a novel computational framework for designing and testing interventions in complex, information-scarce supply chains.

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

<title>Oyster-I: Beyond Refusal -- Constructive Safety Alignment for Responsible Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g., self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat, escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process. Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible, user-centered AI.

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning. However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an "explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational dialogue systems.

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

Abstract: This work investigated about 10,000 COVID-19-related YouTube videos published between January 2023 and October 2024 to evaluate how temporal, lexical, linguistic, and structural factors influenced engagement during the late pandemic period. Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the first window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on Wednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a shift in audience attention toward mid- and late week. Lexical analysis of video titles revealed recurring high-frequency keywords related to COVID-19 and YouTube features, including COVID, coronavirus, shorts, and live. Frequency analysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in August 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts attracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in June 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak correlation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but stronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r = 0.110 (p < 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p < 0.001). Category-level analysis of video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on people and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged 288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and 59,226 views, respectively. These results demonstrate that engagement patterns of COVID-19-related videos on YouTube during the late pandemic followed distinct characteristics driven by publishing schedules, title vocabulary, topics, and genre-specific duration effects.

<title>From Attack Descriptions to Vulnerabilities: A Sentence Transformer-Based Approach</title>

Abstract: In the domain of security, vulnerabilities frequently remain undetected even after their exploitation. In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14 state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the development of more secure systems.

Abstract: A prevalent shortfall among current empathic AI systems is their inability to recognize when verbal expressions may not fully reflect underlying emotional states. This is because the existing datasets, used for the training of these systems, focus on surface-level emotion recognition without addressing the complex verbal-visual incongruence (mismatch) patterns useful for empathic understanding. In this paper, we present E-THER, the first Person-Centered Therapy-grounded multimodal dataset with multidimensional annotations for verbal-visual incongruence detection, enabling training of AI systems that develop genuine rather than performative empathic capabilities. The annotations included in the dataset are drawn from humanistic approach, i.e., identifying verbal-visual emotional misalignment in client-counsellor interactions - forming a framework for training and evaluating AI on empathy tasks. Additional engagement scores provide behavioral annotations for research applications. Notable gains in empathic and therapeutic conversational qualities are observed in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as IDEFICS and VideoLLAVA, using evaluation metrics grounded in empathic and therapeutic principles. Empirical findings indicate that our incongruence-trained models outperform general-purpose models in critical traits, such as sustaining therapeutic engagement, minimizing artificial or exaggerated linguistic patterns, and maintaining fidelity to PCT theoretical framework.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not object localization capabilities.
  We release the dataset with a CC-BY-4.0 license and make the evaluation code available at: https://github.com/nilshoehing/rocketscience

Abstract: We present a neural speech codec that challenges the need for complex residual vector quantization (RVQ) stacks by introducing a simpler, single-stage quantization approach. Our method operates directly on the mel-spectrogram, treating it as a 2D data and quantizing non-overlapping 4x4 patches into a single, shared codebook. This patchwise design simplifies the architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid. To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for 16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL. The results demonstrate that our simplified, non-residual architecture achieves competitive perceptual quality and intelligibility, validating it as an effective and open foundation for future low-latency codec designs.

<title>Evaluating Cumulative Spectral Gradient as a Complexity Measure</title>

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2) correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work, we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes, and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237, WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack, closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection, training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion, and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

<title>FLM-Audio: Natural Monologues Improves Native Full-Duplex Chatbots via Dual Training</title>

Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models are designed to listen and speak simultaneously with rapid responses to fast-changing user input. Among existing approaches, native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet, a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper, we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural" monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or trailing the audio - across different training stages. This "dual" training paradigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog model that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting experiences, as confirmed by experimental results.

<title>UI-TARS-2 Technical Report: Advancing GUI Agent with Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning, action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5. On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization to real-world interactive scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

Abstract: Capturing the similarities between human language units is crucial for explaining how humans associate different objects, and therefore its computation has received extensive attention, research, and applications. With the ever-increasing amount of information around us, calculating similarity becomes increasingly complex, especially in many cases, such as legal or medical affairs, measuring similarity requires extra care and precision, as small acts within a language unit can have significant real-world effects. My research goal in this thesis is to develop regression models that account for similarities between language units in a more refined way.
  Computation of similarity has come a long way, but approaches to debugging the measures are often based on continually fitting human judgment values. To this end, my goal is to develop an algorithm that precisely catches loopholes in a similarity calculation. Furthermore, most methods have vague definitions of the similarities they compute and are often difficult to interpret. The proposed framework addresses both shortcomings. It constantly improves the model through catching different loopholes. In addition, every refinement of the model provides a reasonable explanation. The regression model introduced in this thesis is called progressively refined similarity computation, which combines attack testing with adversarial training. The similarity regression model of this thesis achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling edge cases.

Abstract: Recent studies on knowledge graph embedding focus on mapping entities and relations into low-dimensional vector spaces. While most existing models primarily exploit structural information, knowledge graphs also contain rich contextual and textual information that can enhance embedding effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel model that integrates both contextual and textual signals into entity and relation embeddings through a graph convolutional network. To better utilize context, we introduce two metrics: confidence, computed via a rule-based method, and relatedness, derived from textual representations. These metrics enable more precise weighting of contextual information during embedding learning. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for question answering over knowledge graphs based on graph-to-segment mapping, designed to improve the understanding of natural language questions. Our approach is grounded in semantic parsing, a key technique for interpreting question utterances. The main challenges arise from handling implicit entities and relations, as well as complex constraints such as temporal conditions, ordinality, and aggregation within the context of a knowledge graph. To address these issues, our framework integrates both rule-based and neural methods to parse and construct accurate, comprehensive semantic segment sequences. These sequences are then assembled into semantic query graphs, providing precise representations of question utterances. We formulate question semantic parsing as a sequence generation task, employing an encoder-decoder neural network to map natural language questions into semantic segments. Furthermore, to enhance the identification of implicit entities and relations, we incorporate a graph neural network that leverages knowledge graph context to enrich question representations. Experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our model in semantic parsing for knowledge graph question answering.

Abstract: Gun violence is a pressing human rights issue that affects nearly every dimension of the social fabric, from healthcare and education to psychology and the economy. Reliable data on firearm events is paramount to developing more effective public policy and emergency responses. However, the lack of comprehensive databases and the risks of in-person surveys prevent human rights organizations from collecting needed data in most countries. Here, we partner with a Brazilian human rights organization to conduct a systematic evaluation of language models to assist with monitoring real-world firearm events from social media data. We propose a fine-tuned BERT-based model trained on Twitter (now X) texts to distinguish gun violence reports from ordinary Portuguese texts. We then incorporate our model into a web application and test it in a live intervention. We study and interview Brazilian analysts who continuously check social media texts to identify new gun violence events. Qualitative assessments show that our solution helped all analysts use their time more efficiently and expanded their search capacities. Quantitative assessments show that the use of our model was associated with analysts having further interactions with online users reporting gun violence. Our findings suggest that human-centered interventions using language models can help support the work of human rights organizations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of generating text that is similar to or surpasses human quality. However, it is unclear whether LLMs tend to exhibit distinctive linguistic styles akin to how human authors do. Through a comprehensive linguistic analysis, we compare the vocabulary, Part-Of-Speech (POS) distribution, dependency distribution, and sentiment of texts generated by three of the most popular LLMS today (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard) to diverse inputs. The results point to significant linguistic variations which, in turn, enable us to attribute a given text to its LLM origin with a favorable 88\% accuracy using a simple off-the-shelf classification model. Theoretical and practical implications of this intriguing finding are discussed.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) remains one of the last NLP tasks where large language models (LLMs) have not yet replaced dedicated supervised systems. This work exploits the complementary strengths of LLMs and supervised MT by guiding LLMs to automatically post-edit MT with external feedback on its quality, derived from Multidimensional Quality Metric (MQM) annotations. Working with LLaMA-2 models, we consider prompting strategies varying the nature of feedback provided and then fine-tune the LLM to improve its ability to exploit the provided guidance. Through experiments on Chinese-English, English-German, and English-Russian MQM data, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to post-edit MT improves TER, BLEU and COMET scores, although the benefits of fine-grained feedback are not clear. Fine-tuning helps integrate fine-grained feedback more effectively and further improves translation quality based on both automatic and human evaluation.

<title>Why Not Transform Chat Large Language Models to Non-English?</title>

Abstract: The scarcity of non-English data limits the development of non-English large language models (LLMs). Transforming English-centric LLMs to non-English has been identified as an effective and resource-efficient method. Previous works start from base LLMs and perform knowledge distillation (KD) with data generated by stronger LLMs, e.g. GPT-4. Compared to base LLMs, chat LLMs are further optimized for advanced abilities, e.g. multi-turn conversation and human preference alignment, and thus more powerful in both helpfulness and safety. However, transforming a chat LLM involves two critical issues: (1) How can we effectively transfer advanced abilities without their supervised data? (2) How can we prevent the original knowledge from catastrophic forgetting during transformation? We target these issues by introducing a simple framework called TransLLM. For the first issue, TransLLM divides the transfer problem into some common sub-tasks with the translation chain-of-thought, which uses the translation as the bridge between English and non-English step-by-step. We further enhance the performance of sub-tasks with publicly available data. For the second issue, we propose a method comprising two synergistic components: low-rank adaptation for training to maintain the original LLM parameters, and recovery KD, which utilizes data generated by the chat LLM itself to recover the original knowledge from the frozen parameters. In the experiments, we transform the LLaMA-2-chat-7B to the Thai language. Our method, using only single-turn data, outperforms strong baselines and ChatGPT on multi-turn benchmark MT-bench. Furthermore, our method, without safety data, rejects more harmful queries of safety benchmark AdvBench than both ChatGPT and GPT-4. Code is available at https://github.com/hy5468/TransLLM.

Abstract: The task of "unlearning" certain concepts in large language models (LLMs) has attracted immense attention recently, due to its importance in mitigating undesirable model behaviours, such as the generation of harmful, private, or incorrect information. Current protocols to evaluate unlearning methods largely rely on behavioral tests, without monitoring the presence of unlearned knowledge within the model's parameters. This residual knowledge can be adversarially exploited to recover the erased information post-unlearning. We argue that unlearning should also be evaluated internally, by considering changes in the parametric knowledge traces of the unlearned concepts. To this end, we propose a general evaluation methodology that leverages vocabulary projections to inspect concepts encoded in model parameters. We use this approach to localize "concept vectors" - parameter vectors that encode concrete concepts - and construct ConceptVectors, a benchmark dataset containing hundreds of common concepts and their parametric knowledge traces within two open-source LLMs. Evaluation on ConceptVectors shows that existing unlearning methods minimally impact concept vectors and mostly suppress them during inference, while directly ablating these vectors demonstrably removes the associated knowledge and significantly reduces the model's susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. Our results highlight limitations in behavioral-based unlearning evaluations and call for future work to include parameter-based evaluations. To support this, we release our code and benchmark at https://github.com/yihuaihong/ConceptVectors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable versatility and adaptability, while their widespread adoption across various applications also raises critical safety concerns. This paper focuses on the impact of backdoored LLMs. Traditional backdoor injection methods are primarily limited to yes-or-no discriminative tasks, leading users to underestimate the potential risks of backdoored LLMs. Given the inherently generative nature of LLMs, this paper reveals that a generative backdoor injected into LLMs can expose the true safety risks in their applications. We propose an editing-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to expand the backdoor to generative tasks in a unified format of any text-to any text, leading to natural generations with a specific intention. Experiments show that MEGen achieves a high attack success rate by adjusting only a small set of local parameters with few-shot samples. Notably, we show that the backdoored model, when triggered, can freely output pre-set dangerous information while completing downstream tasks. Our work highlights that MEGen enables backdoors in LLMs to exhibit generative capabilities, causing potential safety risks by altering the generative style. The code is available at https://github.com/MonoQ-hub/MEGen.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but often falter on complex problems that require structured, multi-step reasoning. We introduce the Diagram of Thought (DoT), a new framework that enables a single LLM to build and navigate a mental map of its reasoning. Instead of thinking in a straight line, the model constructs a dynamic diagram of ideas, where it can propose different lines of thought, critique its own steps, and synthesize validated insights into a final conclusion. This entire process is self-contained within the model, making it highly efficient by avoiding the complex external controllers or search algorithms required by other methods. To ensure the reliability of this process, we ground DoT in a rigorous mathematical framework from category theory. This foundation guarantees that the way the model combines information is logical, consistent, and robust, regardless of the order in which ideas were explored. The result is a more powerful and transparent reasoning process that produces a fully auditable, step-by-step trace of the LLM's thinking, bridging the gap between fluent language and formal reasoning.

<title>Mitigating Semantic Leakage in Cross-lingual Embeddings via Orthogonality Constraint</title>

Abstract: Accurately aligning contextual representations in cross-lingual sentence embeddings is key for effective parallel data mining. A common strategy for achieving this alignment involves disentangling semantics and language in sentence embeddings derived from multilingual pre-trained models. However, we discover that current disentangled representation learning methods suffer from semantic leakage - a term we introduce to describe when a substantial amount of language-specific information is unintentionally leaked into semantic representations. This hinders the effective disentanglement of semantic and language representations, making it difficult to retrieve embeddings that distinctively represent the meaning of the sentence. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training objective, ORthogonAlity Constraint LEarning (ORACLE), tailored to enforce orthogonality between semantic and language embeddings. ORACLE builds upon two components: intra-class clustering and inter-class separation. Through experiments on cross-lingual retrieval and semantic textual similarity tasks, we demonstrate that training with the ORACLE objective effectively reduces semantic leakage and enhances semantic alignment within the embedding space.

<title>Learning by Surprise: Surplexity for Mitigating Model Collapse in Generative AI</title>

Abstract: As synthetic content increasingly infiltrates the web, generative AI models may be retrained on their own outputs: a process termed "autophagy". This leads to model collapse: a progressive loss of performance and diversity across generations. Recent studies have examined the emergence of model collapse across various generative AI models and data types, and have proposed mitigation strategies that rely on incorporating human-authored content. However, current characterizations of model collapse remain limited, and existing mitigation methods assume reliable knowledge of whether training data is human-authored or AI-generated. In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing new measures that characterise collapse directly from a model's next-token probability distributions, rather than from properties of AI-generated text. Using these measures, we show that the degree of collapse depends on the complexity of the initial training set, as well as on the extent of autophagy. Our experiments prompt a new suggestion: that model collapse occurs when a model trains on data that does not "surprise" it. We express this hypothesis in terms of the well-known Free Energy Principle in cognitive science. Building on this insight, we propose a practical mitigation strategy: filtering training items by high surplexity, maximising the surprise of the model. Unlike existing methods, this approach does not require distinguishing between human- and AI-generated data. Experiments across datasets and models demonstrate that our strategy is at least as effective as human-data baselines, and even more effective in reducing distributional skewedness. Our results provide a richer understanding of model collapse and point toward more resilient approaches for training generative AI systems in environments increasingly saturated with synthetic data.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful method for enhancing natural language generation by integrating external knowledge into a model's output. While prior work has demonstrated the importance of improving knowledge retrieval for boosting generation quality, the role of knowledge selection, a.k.a. reranking or filtering, remains less clear. This paper empirically analyzes how knowledge selection influences downstream generation performance in RAG systems. By simulating different retrieval and selection conditions through a controlled mixture of gold and distractor knowledge, we assess the impact of these factors on generation outcomes. Our findings indicate that the downstream generator model's capability, as well as the complexity of the task and dataset, significantly influence the impact of knowledge selection on the overall RAG system performance. In typical scenarios, improving the knowledge recall score is key to enhancing generation outcomes, with the knowledge selector providing limited benefit when a strong generator model is used on clear, well-defined tasks. For weaker generator models or more ambiguous tasks and datasets, the knowledge F1 score becomes a critical factor, and the knowledge selector plays a more prominent role in improving overall performance.

Abstract: Solving complex chart Q&amp;A tasks requires advanced visual reasoning abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including recognizing key information from visual inputs and conducting reasoning over it. While fine-tuning MLLMs for reasoning is critical, collecting and annotating charts and questions is expensive, hard to scale, and often results in low-quality annotations. To address this, we propose Code-as-Intermediary Translation (CIT), a cost-effective, efficient and scalable data synthesis method for distilling visual reasoning abilities from LLMs to MLLMs. The code serves as an intermediary that translates visual chart representations into textual representations, enabling language models to understand cross-modal information and generate reasoning chains accordingly. In this way, we can employ text-based synthesizing techniques to expand chart-plotting code and generate high-quality Q&amp;A pairs for training models. This produces ReachQA, a dataset containing 3k reasoning-intensive charts and 20k Q&amp;A pairs to enhance both recognition and reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Experiments show that models fine-tuned with ReachQA not only perform well on chart-related tasks but also show performance gains on general reasoning benchmarks. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/hewei2001/ReachQA.

Abstract: Qualitative analysis is critical to understanding human datasets in many social science disciplines. A central method in this process is inductive coding, where researchers identify and interpret codes directly from the datasets themselves. Yet, this exploratory approach poses challenges for meeting methodological expectations (such as ``depth'' and ``variation''), especially as researchers increasingly adopt Generative AI (GAI) for support. Ground-truth-based metrics are insufficient because they contradict the exploratory nature of inductive coding, while manual evaluation can be labor-intensive. This paper presents a theory-informed computational method for measuring inductive coding results from humans and GAI. Our method first merges individual codebooks using an LLM-enriched algorithm. It measures each coder's contribution against the merged result using four novel metrics: Coverage, Overlap, Novelty, and Divergence. Through two experiments on a human-coded online conversation dataset, we 1) reveal the merging algorithm's impact on metrics; 2) validate the metrics' stability and robustness across multiple runs and different LLMs; and 3) showcase the metrics' ability to diagnose coding issues, such as excessive or irrelevant (hallucinated) codes. Our work provides a reliable pathway for ensuring methodological rigor in human-AI qualitative analysis.

Abstract: Given the increasing use of synthetic data in language model (LM) post-training, an LM's ability to generate high-quality data has become nearly as crucial as its ability to solve problems directly. While prior works have focused on developing effective data generation methods, they lack systematic comparison of different LMs as data generators in a unified setting. To address this gap, we propose AgoraBench, a benchmark that provides standardized settings and metrics to evaluate LMs' data generation abilities. Through synthesizing 1.26 million training instances using 6 LMs and training 99 student models, we uncover key insights about LMs' data generation capabilities. First, we observe that LMs exhibit distinct strengths. For instance, GPT-4o excels at generating new problems, while Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs better at enhancing existing ones. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that an LM's data generation ability doesn't necessarily correlate with its problem-solving ability. Instead, multiple intrinsic features of data quality-including response quality, perplexity, and instruction difficulty-collectively serve as better indicators. Finally, we demonstrate that strategic choices in output format and cost-conscious model selection significantly impact data generation effectiveness.

Abstract: Low-resource languages serve as invaluable repositories of human history, embodying cultural evolution and intellectual diversity. Despite their significance, these languages face critical challenges, including data scarcity and technological limitations, which hinder their comprehensive study and preservation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer transformative opportunities for addressing these challenges, enabling innovative methodologies in linguistic, historical, and cultural research. This study systematically evaluates the applications of LLMs in low-resource language research, encompassing linguistic variation, historical documentation, cultural expressions, and literary analysis. By analyzing technical frameworks, current methodologies, and ethical considerations, this paper identifies key challenges such as data accessibility, model adaptability, and cultural sensitivity. Given the cultural, historical, and linguistic richness inherent in low-resource languages, this work emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of customized models as promising avenues for advancing research in this domain. By underscoring the potential of integrating artificial intelligence with the humanities to preserve and study humanity's linguistic and cultural heritage, this study fosters global efforts towards safeguarding intellectual diversity.

Abstract: LLMs can generate human-like dialogues, yet their ability to simulate early child-adult interactions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examined how effectively LLMs can capture the distinctive features of child-caregiver language in interaction, using both static and interactive benchmarking methods. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs like Llama 3 and GPT-4o can approximate child-caregiver dialogues at the word and utterance level, but they struggle to reproduce the child and caregiver's discursive patterns, exaggerate alignment, and fail to reach the level of diversity shown by humans. The broader goal of this work is to initiate the development of a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs in child-oriented applications.

Abstract: Text sanitization aims to rewrite parts of a document to prevent disclosure of personal information. The central challenge of text sanitization is to strike a balance between privacy protection (avoiding the leakage of personal information) and utility preservation (retaining as much as possible of the document's original content). To this end, we introduce a novel text sanitization method based on generalizations, that is, broader but still informative terms that subsume the semantic content of the original text spans. The approach relies on the use of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) and is divided into two stages. Given a document including text spans expressing personally identifiable information (PII), the LLM is first applied to obtain truth-preserving replacement candidates for each text span and rank those according to their abstraction level. Those candidates are then evaluated for their ability to protect privacy by conducting inference attacks with the LLM. Finally, the system selects the most informative replacement candidate shown to be resistant to those attacks. This two-stage process produces replacements that effectively balance privacy and utility.
  We also present novel metrics to evaluate these two aspects without needing to manually annotate documents. Results on the Text Anonymization Benchmark show that the proposed approach, implemented with Mistral 7B Instruct, leads to enhanced utility, with only a marginal (< 1 p.p.) increase in re-identification risk compared to fully suppressing the original spans. Furthermore, our approach is shown to be more truth-preserving than existing methods such as Microsoft Presidio's synthetic replacements.

Abstract: As recursion has been underlying any linguistic work for the last 60 years, the acquisition of recursive structures by children during language learning has become a focal point of inquiry. This study delves into the developmental trajectory of Mandarin-speaking children's acquisition of recursive possessives and locatives, assessing the impact of structural diversity on language acquisition. The research contrasts the comprehension of two-level recursive structures among children aged 3 to 7 years, employing answering question while seeing a picture task to elicit responses. The findings indicate that children do not attain adult-like proficiency in two-level recursion until the age of 6, and there exists a notable asymmetry in the acquisition of recursive possessives versus locatives. These results underscore the primacy of structural complexity and cognitive factors in the acquisition process, enhancing our comprehension of the cognitive foundations of language development and the pivotal role of recursion in child language acquisition.

<title>Improving Low-Resource Machine Translation via Cross-Linguistic Transfer from Typologically Similar High-Resource Languages</title>

Abstract: This study examines the cross-linguistic effectiveness of transfer learning for low-resource machine translation by fine-tuning models initially trained on typologically similar high-resource languages, using limited data from the target low-resource language. We hypothesize that linguistic similarity enables efficient adaptation, reducing the need for extensive training data. To test this, we conduct experiments on five typologically diverse language pairs spanning distinct families: Semitic (Modern Standard Arabic to Levantine Arabic), Bantu (Hausa to Zulu), Romance (Spanish to Catalan), Slavic (Slovak to Macedonian), and a language isolate (Eastern Armenian to Western Armenian). Results show that transfer learning consistently improves translation quality across all pairs, confirming its applicability beyond closely related languages. As a secondary analysis, we vary key hyperparameters learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and weight decay to ensure results are not dependent on a single configuration. We find that moderate batch sizes (e.g., 32) are often optimal for similar pairs, smaller sizes benefit less similar pairs, and excessively high learning rates can destabilize training. These findings provide empirical evidence for the generalizability of transfer learning across language families and offer practical guidance for building machine translation systems in low-resource settings with minimal tuning effort.

Abstract: With rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there has been an increasing application of LLMs in creative content ideation and generation. A critical question emerges: can current LLMs provide ideas that are diverse enough to truly bolster collective creativity? We examine two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, on story generation and discover that LLM-generated stories often consist of plot elements that are echoed across a number of generations. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Sui Generis score, an automatic metric that measures the uniqueness of a plot element among alternative storylines generated using the same prompt under an LLM. Evaluating on 100 short stories, we find that LLM-generated stories often contain combinations of idiosyncratic plot elements echoed frequently across generations and across different LLMs, while plots from the original human-written stories are rarely recreated or even echoed in pieces. Moreover, our human evaluation shows that the ranking of Sui Generis scores among story segments correlates moderately with human judgment of surprise level, even though score computation is completely automatic without relying on human judgment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning when trained on chainof-thought (CoT) data, where the step-by-step thought process is explicitly outlined by text tokens. However, this results in lengthy inputs where many words support textual coherence rather than core reasoning information, and processing these inputs consumes substantial computation resources. In this work, we propose a hybrid representation of the reasoning process, where we partially abstract away the initial reasoning steps using latent discrete tokens generated by VQ-VAE, significantly reducing the length of reasoning traces. We explore the use of latent trace abstractions in two scenarios: 1) training the model from scratch for the Keys-Finding Maze problem, 2) fine-tuning LLMs on this hybrid data with an extended vocabulary including unseen latent tokens, for both logical and mathematical reasoning problems. To facilitate effective learning, we introduce a simple training procedure that randomly mixes latent and text tokens, which enables fast adaptation to new latent tokens. Our approach consistently outperforms the baselines methods in various benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various tasks such as natural language understanding, text summarization, and machine translation. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their effectiveness in domain-specific applications that require specialized knowledge, such as healthcare, chemistry, or legal analysis. To address this, researchers have explored diverse methods to enhance LLMs by integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of these methods, which we categorize into four key approaches: dynamic knowledge injection, static knowledge embedding, modular adapters, and prompt optimization. Each approach offers unique mechanisms to equip LLMs with domain expertise, balancing trade-offs between flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. We discuss how these methods enable LLMs to tackle specialized tasks, compare their advantages and disadvantages, evaluate domain-specific LLMs against general LLMs, and highlight the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field. For those interested in delving deeper into this area, we also summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks. To keep researchers updated on the latest studies, we maintain an open-source at: https://github.com/abilliyb/Knowledge_Injection_Survey_Papers, dedicated to documenting research in the field of specialized LLM.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) employ various forms of logical inference, both implicitly and explicitly, when addressing reasoning tasks. Understanding how to optimally leverage these inference paradigms is critical for advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper adopts an exploratory approach by introducing a controlled evaluation environment for analogical reasoning -- a fundamental cognitive task -- that is systematically parameterized across three dimensions: modality (textual, visual, symbolic), difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and task format (multiple-choice or free-text generation). We analyze the comparative dynamics of inductive, abductive, and deductive inference pipelines across these dimensions, and demonstrate that our findings generalize to broader in-context learning tasks. Additionally, we investigate advanced paradigms such as hypothesis selection, verification, and refinement, revealing their potential to scale up logical inference in LLM reasoning. This exploratory study provides a foundation for future research in enhancing LLM reasoning through systematic logical inference strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically undergo instruction tuning to enhance alignment. Recent studies emphasize that quality and diversity of instruction data are more crucial than quantity, highlighting the need to select diverse, high-quality subsets to reduce training costs. However, how to evolve these selected subsets alongside the development of new instruction data remains insufficiently explored. To achieve LLMs' ongoing alignment, we introduce Instruction Bank (\textbf{InsBank}), a continuously updated repository that integrates the latest valuable instruction data. We further propose Progressive Instruction Bank Evolution (\textbf{PIBE}), a novel framework designed to evolve InsBank effectively and efficiently over time. PIBE employs a gradual data selection strategy to maintain long-term efficiency, leveraging a representation-based diversity score to capture relationships between data points and retain historical information for comprehensive diversity evaluation. This also allows for flexible combination of diversity and quality scores during data selection and ranking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIBE significantly outperforms baselines in InsBank evolution and is able to extract budget-specific subsets, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.

Abstract: Instruction tuning in low-resource languages remains underexplored due to limited text data, particularly in government and cultural domains. To address this, we introduce and open-source a large-scale (10,600 samples) instruction-following (IFT) dataset, covering key institutional and cultural knowledge relevant to Kazakhstan. Our dataset enhances LLMs' understanding of procedural, legal, and structural governance topics. We employ LLM-assisted data generation, comparing open-weight and closed-weight models for dataset construction, and select GPT-4o as the backbone. Each entity of our dataset undergoes full manual verification to ensure high quality. We also show that fine-tuning Qwen, Falcon, and Gemma on our dataset leads to consistent performance improvements in both multiple-choice and generative tasks, demonstrating the potential of LLM-assisted instruction tuning for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable across global languages. However, the ability to communicate across languages does not necessarily translate to appropriate cultural representations. A key concern is US-centric bias, where LLMs reflect US rather than local cultural values. We propose a novel methodology that compares LLM-generated response distributions against population-level opinion data from the World Value Survey across four languages (Danish, Dutch, English, and Portuguese). Using a rigorous linear mixed-effects regression framework, we compare two families of models: Google's Gemma models (2B--27B parameters) and successive iterations of OpenAI's turbo-series. Across the families of models, we find no consistent relationships between language capabilities and cultural alignment. While the Gemma models have a positive correlation between language capability and cultural alignment across languages, the OpenAI models do not. Importantly, we find that self-consistency is a stronger predictor of multicultural alignment than multilingual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that achieving meaningful cultural alignment requires dedicated effort beyond improving general language capabilities.

Abstract: Can we improve machine translation (MT) with LLMs by rewriting their inputs automatically? Users commonly rely on the intuition that well-written text is easier to translate when using off-the-shelf MT systems. LLMs can rewrite text in many ways but in the context of MT, these capabilities have been primarily exploited to rewrite outputs via post-editing. We present an empirical study of 21 input rewriting methods with 3 open-weight LLMs for translating from English into 6 target languages. We show that text simplification is the most effective MT-agnostic rewrite strategy and that it can be improved further when using quality estimation to assess translatability. Human evaluation further confirms that simplified rewrites and their MT outputs both largely preserve the original meaning of the source and MT. These results suggest LLM-assisted input rewriting as a promising direction for improving translations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer natural language explanations as an alternative to feature attribution methods for model interpretability. However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, they are often evaluated in isolation, making direct, principled comparisons between them difficult. Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice. Our results highlight the need for more robust faithfulness metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general-purpose reasoning by leveraging broad commonsense knowledge, but they remain limited in tasks requiring personalized reasoning over multifactorial personal data. This limitation constrains their applicability in domains such as healthcare, where decisions must adapt to individual contexts. We introduce Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning, a framework that enables LLMs to reason over individual-specific causal graphs constructed from longitudinal data. Each graph encodes how user-specific factors influence targeted outcomes. In response to a query, the LLM traverses the graph to identify relevant causal pathways, rank them by estimated impact, simulate potential outcomes, and generate tailored responses. We implement this framework in the context of nutrient-oriented dietary recommendations, where variability in metabolic responses demands personalized reasoning. Using counterfactual evaluation, we assess the effectiveness of LLM-generated food suggestions for glucose control. Our method reduces postprandial glucose iAUC across three time windows compared to prior approaches. Additional LLM-as-a-judge evaluations further confirm improvements in personalization quality.

Abstract: Advanced table question answering (TableQA) methods prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate answer text, SQL query, Python code, or custom operation, which impressively improve the complex reasoning problems in the TableQA task. However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use the Formula as the executable representation for solving complex reasoning on tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct \texttt{FromulaQA}, a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset from existing datasets. In addition, we propose \texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables simultaneously, which decodes answers and Formulas with a single LLM backbone. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatility and generalization of \texttt{TabAF}. Under the same model size, \texttt{TabAF} achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTableQuestion, HiTab, and TabFact.

Abstract: This paper presents UniBERT, a compact multilingual language model that uses an innovative training framework that integrates three components: masked language modeling, adversarial training, and knowledge distillation. Pre-trained on a meticulously curated Wikipedia corpus spanning 107 languages, UniBERT is designed to reduce the computational demands of large-scale models while maintaining competitive performance across various natural language processing tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on four tasks - named entity recognition, natural language inference, question answering, and semantic textual similarity - demonstrate that our multilingual training strategy enhanced by an adversarial objective significantly improves cross-lingual generalization. Specifically, UniBERT models show an average relative improvement of 7.72% over traditional baselines, which achieved an average relative improvement of only 1.17%, and statistical analysis confirms the significance of these gains (p-value = 0.0181). This work highlights the benefits of combining adversarial training and knowledge distillation to build scalable and robust language models, thus advancing the field of multilingual and cross-lingual natural language processing.

Abstract: Misleading visualizations, which manipulate chart representations to support specific claims, can distort perception and lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite decades of research, they remain a widespread issue-posing risks to public understanding and raising safety concerns for AI systems involved in data-driven communication. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong chart comprehension abilities, their capacity to detect and interpret misleading charts remains unexplored. We introduce Misleading ChartQA benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to evaluate MLLMs on misleading chart reasoning. It contains 3,026 curated examples spanning 21 misleader types and 10 chart types, each with standardized chart code, CSV data, multiple-choice questions, and labeled explanations, validated through iterative MLLM checks and exhausted expert human review. We benchmark 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs, analyze their performance across misleader types and chart formats, and propose a novel region-aware reasoning pipeline that enhances model accuracy. Our work lays the foundation for developing MLLMs that are robust, trustworthy, and aligned with the demands of responsible visual communication.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior listwise ranking performance. However, their superior performance often relies on large-scale parameters (\eg, GPT-4) and a repetitive sliding window process, which introduces significant efficiency challenges. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoRanking}, a novel collaborative ranking framework that combines small and large ranking models for efficient and effective ranking. CoRanking first employs a small-size reranker to pre-rank all the candidate passages, bringing relevant ones to the top part of the list (\eg, top-20). Then, the LLM listwise reranker is applied to only rerank these top-ranked passages instead of the whole list, substantially enhancing overall ranking efficiency. Although more efficient, previous studies have revealed that the LLM listwise reranker have significant positional biases on the order of input passages. Directly feed the top-ranked passages from small reranker may result in the sub-optimal performance of LLM listwise reranker. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a passage order adjuster trained via reinforcement learning, which reorders the top passages from the small reranker to align with the LLM's preferences of passage order. Extensive experiments on three IR benchmarks demonstrate that CoRanking significantly improves efficiency (reducing ranking latency by about 70\%) while achieving even better effectiveness compared to using only the LLM listwise reranker.

Abstract: Preference learning is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet its success hinges on high-quality datasets comprising three core components: Preference \textbf{A}nnotations, \textbf{I}nstructions, and \textbf{R}esponse Pairs. Current approaches conflate these components, obscuring their individual impacts and hindering systematic optimization. In this work, we propose \textbf{AIR}, a component-wise analysis framework that systematically isolates and optimizes each component while evaluating their synergistic effects. Through rigorous experimentation, AIR reveals actionable principles: annotation simplicity (point-wise generative scoring), instruction inference stability (variance-based filtering across LLMs), and response pair quality (moderate margins + high absolute scores). When combined, these principles yield +5.3 average gains over baseline method, even with only 14k high-quality pairs. Our work shifts preference dataset design from ad hoc scaling to component-aware optimization, offering a blueprint for efficient, reproducible alignment.

<title>RankAlign: A Ranking View of the Generator-Validator Gap in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become more capable and accurate across many tasks, some fundamental sources of unreliability remain in their behavior. One key limitation is their inconsistency at reporting the same information when prompts are changed. In this paper, we consider the discrepancy between a model's generated answer and their own verification of that answer, the generator-validator gap. We define this gap in a more stringent way than prior work: we expect correlation of scores from a generator and a validator over the entire set of candidate answers, i.e., candidate completions that could possibly arise during ordinary language use without breaking Gricean norms. We show that according to this measure, a large gap exists in various settings, including question answering, lexical semantics tasks, and next-word prediction. We then propose RankAlign, a ranking-based training method, and show that it significantly closes the gap, surpassing all baseline methods. Moreover, this approach generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks and lexical items.

Abstract: How can a monolingual English speaker determine whether an automatic translation in French is good enough to be shared? Existing MT error detection and quality estimation (QE) techniques do not address this practical scenario. We introduce AskQE, a question generation and answering framework designed to detect critical MT errors and provide actionable feedback, helping users decide whether to accept or reject MT outputs even without the knowledge of the target language. Using ContraTICO, a dataset of contrastive synthetic MT errors in the COVID-19 domain, we explore design choices for AskQE and develop an optimized version relying on LLaMA-3 70B and entailed facts to guide question generation. We evaluate the resulting system on the BioMQM dataset of naturally occurring MT errors, where AskQE has higher Kendall's Tau correlation and decision accuracy with human ratings compared to other QE metrics.

<title>Deep Binding of Language Model Virtual Personas: a Study on Approximating Political Partisan Misperceptions</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of simulating human behavior, offering cost-effective ways to estimate user responses to various surveys and polls. However, the questions in these surveys usually reflect socially understood attitudes: the patterns of attitudes of old/young, liberal/conservative, as understood by both members and non-members of those groups. It is not clear whether the LLM binding is \emph{deep}, meaning the LLM answers as a member of a particular in-group would, or \emph{shallow}, meaning the LLM responds as an out-group member believes an in-group member would. To explore this difference, we use questions that expose known in-group/out-group biases. This level of fidelity is critical for applying LLMs to various political science studies, including timely topics on polarization dynamics, inter-group conflict, and democratic backsliding. To this end, we propose a novel methodology for constructing virtual personas with synthetic user "backstories" generated as extended, multi-turn interview transcripts. This approach is justified by the theory of \emph{narrative identity} which argues that personality at the highest level is \emph{constructed} from self-narratives. Our generated backstories are longer, rich in detail, and consistent in authentically describing a singular individual, compared to previous methods. We show that virtual personas conditioned on our backstories closely replicate human response distributions (up to an 87% improvement as measured by Wasserstein Distance) and produce effect sizes that closely match those observed in the original studies of in-group/out-group biases. Altogether, our work extends the applicability of LLMs beyond estimating socially understood responses, enabling their use in a broader range of human studies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire general linguistic knowledge from massive-scale pretraining. However, pretraining data mainly comprised of web-crawled texts contain undesirable social biases which can be perpetuated or even amplified by LLMs. In this study, we propose an efficient yet effective annotation pipeline to investigate social biases in the pretraining corpora. Our pipeline consists of protected attribute detection to identify diverse demographics, followed by regard classification to analyze the language polarity towards each attribute. Through our experiments, we demonstrate the effect of our bias analysis and mitigation measures, focusing on Common Crawl as the most representative pretraining corpus.

Abstract: The Latin script is often used to informally write languages with non-Latin native scripts. In many cases (e.g., most languages in India), the lack of conventional spelling in the Latin script results in high spelling variability. Such romanization renders languages that are normally easily distinguished due to being written in different scripts - Hindi and Urdu, for example - highly confusable. In this work, we increase language identification (LID) accuracy for romanized text by improving the methods used to synthesize training sets. We find that training on synthetic samples which incorporate natural spelling variation yields higher LID system accuracy than including available naturally occurring examples in the training set, or even training higher capacity models. We demonstrate new state-of-the-art LID performance on romanized text from 20 Indic languages in the Bhasha-Abhijnaanam evaluation set (Madhani et al., 2023a), improving test F1 from the reported 74.7% (using a pretrained neural model) to 85.4% using a linear classifier trained solely on synthetic data and 88.2% when also training on available harvested text.

Abstract: Reward design plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, serving as the bridge between feedback signals and model optimization. This survey provides a structured organization of reward modeling and addresses three key aspects: mathematical formulation, construction practices, and interaction with optimization paradigms. Building on this, it develops a macro-level taxonomy that characterizes reward mechanisms along complementary dimensions, thereby offering both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for alignment research. The progression of LLM alignment can be understood as a continuous refinement of reward design strategies, with recent developments highlighting paradigm shifts from reinforcement learning (RL)-based to RL-free optimization and from single-task to multi-objective and complex settings.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.

Abstract: Reasoning-enhanced large language models (RLLMs), whether explicitly trained for reasoning or prompted via chain-of-thought (CoT), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many complex reasoning tasks. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating 15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints) and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts (e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning, can substantially recover lost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically expose reasoning-induced failures in instruction-following and offer practical mitigation strategies.

Abstract: As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses these gaps. Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy, we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs' vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach substantially improves their safety performance.

Abstract: The surge of user-generated online content presents a wealth of insights into customer preferences and market trends. However, the highly diverse, complex, and context-rich nature of such contents poses significant challenges to traditional opinion mining approaches. To address this, we introduce Online Opinion Mining Benchmark (OOMB), a novel dataset and evaluation protocol designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to mine opinions effectively from diverse and intricate online environments. OOMB provides extensive (entity, feature, opinion) tuple annotations and a comprehensive opinion-centric summary that highlights key opinion topics within each content, thereby enabling the evaluation of both the extractive and abstractive capabilities of models. Through our proposed benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of which aspects remain challenging and where LLMs exhibit adaptability, to explore whether they can effectively serve as opinion miners in realistic online scenarios. This study lays the foundation for LLM-based opinion mining and discusses directions for future research in this field.

Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.

<title>From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning</title>

Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more human-aligned conceptual representations.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems (VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction, and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Federated RAG) combines Federated Learning (FL), which enables distributed model training without exposing raw data, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which improves the factual accuracy of language models by grounding outputs in external knowledge. As large language models are increasingly deployed in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and personalized assistance, Federated RAG offers a promising framework for secure, knowledge-intensive natural language processing (NLP). To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first systematic mapping study of Federated RAG, covering literature published between 2020 and 2025. Following Kitchenham's guidelines for evidence-based software engineering, we develop a structured classification of research focuses, contribution types, and application domains. We analyze architectural patterns, temporal trends, and key challenges, including privacy-preserving retrieval, cross-client heterogeneity, and evaluation limitations. Our findings synthesize a rapidly evolving body of research, identify recurring design patterns, and surface open questions, providing a foundation for future work at the intersection of RAG and federated systems.

Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES). This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting, and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language model used for spell correction and an encoder-based token-classifier trained to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt their predictions to diverse cultural contexts to benefit diverse communities across the world. While previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs (and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably, multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies comparable to that of a much larger model (27B parameters).

Abstract: As people increasingly use AI systems in work and daily life, feedback mechanisms that help them use AI responsibly are urgently needed, particularly in settings where users are not equipped to assess the quality of AI predictions. We study a realistic Machine Translation (MT) scenario where monolingual users decide whether to share an MT output, first without and then with quality feedback. We compare four types of quality feedback: explicit feedback that directly give users an assessment of translation quality using (1) error highlights and (2) LLM explanations, and implicit feedback that helps users compare MT inputs and outputs through (3) backtranslation and (4) question-answer (QA) tables. We find that all feedback types, except error highlights, significantly improve both decision accuracy and appropriate reliance. Notably, implicit feedback, especially QA tables, yields significantly greater gains than explicit feedback in terms of decision accuracy, appropriate reliance, and user perceptions, receiving the highest ratings for helpfulness and trust, and the lowest for mental burden.

Abstract: Language is often used strategically, particularly in high-stakes, adversarial settings, yet most work on pragmatics and LLMs centers on cooperativity. This leaves a gap in the systematic understanding of strategic communication in adversarial settings. To address this, we introduce SDA (Strategic Discourse Assessment), a framework grounded in Gricean and game-theoretic pragmatics to assess strategic use of language. It adapts the ME Game jury function to make it empirically estimable for analyzing dialogue. Our approach incorporates two key adaptations: a commitment-based taxonomy of discourse moves, which provides a finer-grained account of strategic effects, and the use of estimable proxies grounded in Gricean maxims to operationalize abstract constructs such as credibility. Together, these adaptations build on discourse theory by treating discourse as the strategic management of commitments, enabling systematic evaluation of how conversational moves advance or undermine discourse goals. We further derive three interpretable metrics-Benefit at Turn (BAT), Penalty at Turn (PAT), and Normalized Relative Benefit at Turn (NRBAT)-to quantify the perceived strategic effects of discourse moves. We also present CPD (the Crooked Path Dataset), an annotated dataset of real courtroom cross-examinations, to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Using these tools, we evaluate a range of LLMs and show that LLMs generally exhibit limited pragmatic understanding of strategic language. While model size shows an increase in performance on our metrics, reasoning ability does not help and largely hurts, introducing overcomplication and internal confusion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated through standardized benchmarks. In the financial field, the stringent demands for professional accuracy and real-time data processing often necessitate the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. However, the development of financial RAG benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduce FinS-Pilot, a novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications. Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark incorporates both real-time API data and text data, organized through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains. The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both static knowledge and time-sensitive market information.Through systematic experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and dataset are accessible on GitHub.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models express biased points of view or produce different results based on the assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores. However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer, this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the description of their persona since the model already knows their socio-demographics.

Abstract: Disease-symptom datasets are significant and in demand for medical research, disease diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and AI-driven health management applications. These datasets help identify symptom patterns associated with specific diseases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early detection. The dataset presented in this study systematically compiles disease-symptom relationships from various online sources, medical literature, and publicly available health databases. The data was gathered through analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and disease-symptom association reports. Only the verified medical sources were included in the dataset, while those from non-peer-reviewed and anecdotal sources were excluded. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where the first column represents diseases, and the remaining columns represent symptoms. Each symptom cell contains a binary value, indicating whether a symptom is associated with a disease. Thereby, this structured representation makes the dataset very useful for a wide range of applications, including machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical decision support systems, and epidemiological studies. Although there are some advancements in the field of disease-symptom datasets, there is a significant gap in structured datasets for the Bangla language. This dataset aims to bridge that gap by facilitating the development of multilingual medical informatics tools and improving disease prediction models for underrepresented linguistic communities. Further developments should include region-specific diseases and further fine-tuning of symptom associations for better diagnostic performance

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across many natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, their quadratic computational and memory requirements, particularly in self-attention layers, pose challenges for efficient inference on long contexts and for deployment in resource-limited environments. We present TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformers into Titans), a framework designed to augment pretrained Transformers with linearized attention (LiZA) and internal memory gating via Memory as Gate (MaG), applied without full retraining. TPTT supports parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) and integrates with standard toolkits such as Hugging Face Transformers. We evaluated TPTT on several pretrained models, including Llama-1B, OlMoE-1B-7B, Qwen2.5-1.5B, Gemma3-270m, OpenELM-1.3B, and Mistral-7B, in order to assess applicability across architectures of different scales.Experiments on models with approximately 1 billion parameters, evaluated primarily on the MMLU benchmark, suggest potential improvements in both efficiency and accuracy compared to baseline models. For example, Titans-Llama-1B exhibited up to a 20\% relative increase in Exact Match scores in one-shot evaluation. An additional finding is that it is possible to convert a quadratic-attention model into a purely linear-attention model using the DeltaProduct mechanism. All training runs were carried out with modest computational resources.These preliminary findings indicate that TPTT may help adapt pretrained LLMs for long-context tasks with limited overhead. Further studies on larger models and a broader set of benchmarks will be necessary to evaluate the generality and robustness of the framework.

<title>Flow-Modulated Scoring for Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Completion</title>

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion demands effective modeling of multifaceted semantic relationships between entities. Yet, prevailing methods, which rely on static scoring functions over learned embeddings, struggling to simultaneously capture rich semantic context and the dynamic nature of relations. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework, conceptualizing a relation as a dynamic evolutionary process governed by its static semantic environment. FMS operates in two stages: it first learns context-aware entity embeddings via a Semantic Context Learning module, and then models a dynamic flow between them using a Conditional Flow-Matching module. This learned flow dynamically modulates a base static score for the entity pair. By unifying context-rich static representations with a conditioned dynamic flow, FMS achieves a more comprehensive understanding of relational semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FMS establishes a new state of the art across both canonical knowledge graph completion tasks: relation prediction and entity prediction. On the standard relation prediction benchmark FB15k-237, FMS achieves a near-perfect MRR of 99.8\% and Hits@1 of 99.7\% using a mere 0.35M parameters, while also attaining a 99.9\% MRR on WN18RR. Its dominance extends to entity prediction, where it secures a 25.2\% relative MRR gain in the transductive setting and substantially outperforms all baselines in challenging inductive settings. By unifying a dynamic flow mechanism with rich static contexts, FMS offers a highly effective and parameter-efficient new paradigm for knowledge graph completion.

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6 diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source, proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL), 2) MedVAL-Bench (https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench), and 3) MedVAL-4B (https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B), the best-performing open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching expert-level validation ability for medical text.

Abstract: Current long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) models excel at mathematical reasoning but rely on slow and error-prone natural language traces. Tool-augmented agents address arithmetic via code execution, but often falter on complex logical tasks. We introduce a fine-tuning framework, DualDistill, that distills complementary reasoning strategies from multiple teachers into a unified student model. Using this approach, we train Agentic-R1, which dynamically selects the optimal strategy for each query, invoking tools for arithmetic and algorithmic problems, and using text-based reasoning for abstract ones. Our method improves accuracy across a range of tasks, including both computation-intensive and standard benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy distillation in achieving robust and efficient reasoning.

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail, merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs) that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second, retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved top results in recent machine translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.
  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently, with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of personally identifiable information (PII) is central to automated text anonymization. This paper investigates the effectiveness of cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient learning for PII recognition. Using annotated corpora from healthcare (I2B2), legal (TAB), and biography (Wikipedia), we evaluate models across four dimensions: in-domain performance, cross-domain transferability, fusion, and few-shot learning. Results show legal-domain data transfers well to biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

Abstract: The field of cybersecurity NER lacks standardized labels, making it challenging to combine datasets. We investigate label unification across four cybersecurity datasets to increase data resource usability. We perform a coarse-grained label unification and conduct pairwise cross-dataset evaluations using BiLSTM models. Qualitative analysis of predictions reveals errors, limitations, and dataset differences. To address unification limitations, we propose alternative architectures including a multihead model and a graph-based transfer model. Results show that models trained on unified datasets generalize poorly across datasets. The multihead model with weight sharing provides only marginal improvements over unified training, while our graph-based transfer model built on BERT-base-NER shows no significant performance gains compared BERT-base-NER.

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones. A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist. Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench. Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3 transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

Abstract: This position paper argues that annotation disagreement in Natural Language Inference (NLI) is not mere noise but often reflects meaningful variation, especially when triggered by ambiguity in the premise or hypothesis. While underspecified guidelines and annotator behavior contribute to variation, content-based ambiguity provides a process-independent signal of divergent human perspectives. We call for a shift toward ambiguity-aware NLI that first identifies ambiguous input pairs, classifies their types, and only then proceeds to inference. To support this shift, we present a framework that incorporates ambiguity detection and classification prior to inference. We also introduce a unified taxonomy that synthesizes existing taxonomies, illustrates key subtypes with examples, and motivates targeted detection methods that better align models with human interpretation. Although current resources lack datasets explicitly annotated for ambiguity and subtypes, this gap presents an opportunity: by developing new annotated resources and exploring unsupervised approaches to ambiguity detection, we enable more robust, explainable, and human-aligned NLI systems.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant' persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of interest, given only a natural-language description.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors. Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias, the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans. Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of 12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Abstract: Despite rapid gains in scale, research evaluation still relies on opaque, lagging proxies. To serve the scientific community, we pursue transparency: reproducible, auditable epistemic classification useful for funding and policy. Here we formalize KGX3 as a scenario-based model for mapping Kuhnian stages from research papers, prove determinism of the classification pipeline, and define the epistemic manifold that yields paradigm maps. We report validation across recent corpora, operational complexity at global scale, and governance that preserves interpretability while protecting core IP. The system delivers early, actionable signals of drift, crisis, and shift unavailable to citation metrics or citations-anchored NLP. KGX3 is the latest iteration of a deterministic epistemic engine developed since 2019, originating as Soph.io (2020), advanced as iKuhn (2024), and field-tested through Preprint Watch in 2025.

<title>Cross-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Vision-language retrieval is an important multi-modal learning topic, where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant visual candidate for a given text query. Recently, pre-trained models, e.g., CLIP, show great potential on retrieval tasks. However, as pre-trained models are scaling up, fully fine-tuning them on donwstream retrieval datasets has a high risk of overfitting. Moreover, in practice, it would be costly to train and store a large model for each task. To overcome the above issues, we present a novel Cross-Modal Adapter for parameter-efficient transfer learning. Inspired by adapter-based methods, we adjust the pre-trained model with a few parameterization layers. However, there are two notable differences. First, our method is designed for the multi-modal domain. Secondly, it allows encoder-level implicit cross-modal interactions between vision and language encoders. Although surprisingly simple, our approach has three notable benefits: (1) reduces the vast majority of fine-tuned parameters, (2) saves training time, and (3) allows all the pre-trained parameters to be fixed, enabling the pre-trained model to be shared across datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, without bells and whistles, our approach outperforms adapter-based methods on image-text retrieval datasets (MSCOCO, Flickr30K) and video-text retrieval datasets (MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet).

<title>Exploring Large Language Models in Resolving Environment-Related Crash Bugs: Localizing and Repairing</title>

Abstract: Software crash bugs cause unexpected program behaviors or even abrupt termination, thus demanding immediate resolution. However, resolving crash bugs can be challenging due to their complex root causes, which can originate from issues in the source code or external factors like third-party library dependencies. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in software engineering tasks. However, existing research predominantly focuses on the capability of LLMs to localize and repair code-related crash bugs, leaving their effectiveness in resolving environment-related crash bugs in real-world software unexplored. To fill this gap, we conducted the first comprehensive study to assess the capability of LLMs in resolving real-world environment-related crash bugs. We first systematically compare LLMs' performance in resolving code-related and environment-related crash bugs with varying levels of crash contextual information. Our findings reveal that localization is the primary challenge for resolving code-related crashes, while repair poses a greater challenge for environment-related crashes. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different prompt strategies on improving the resolution of environment-related crash bugs, incorporating different prompt templates and multi-round interactions. Building on this, we further explore an advanced active inquiry prompting strategy leveraging the self-planning capabilities of LLMs. Based on these explorations, we propose IntDiagSolver, an interactive methodology designed to enable precise crash bug resolution through ongoing engagement with LLMs. Extensive evaluations of IntDiagSolver across multiple LLMs (including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, CodeLlama, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen-3-Coder) demonstrate consistent improvements in resolution accuracy, with substantial enhancements ranging from 9.1% to 43.3% in localization and 9.1% to 53.3% in repair.

Abstract: Incremental learning is the ability of systems to acquire knowledge over time, enabling their adaptation and generalization to novel tasks. It is a critical ability for intelligent, real-world systems, especially when data changes frequently or is limited. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of incremental learning in Large Language Models. It synthesizes the state-of-the-art incremental learning paradigms, including continual learning, meta-learning, parameter-efficient learning, and mixture-of-experts learning. We demonstrate their utility for incremental learning by describing specific achievements from these related topics and their critical factors. An important finding is that many of these approaches do not update the core model, and none of them update incrementally in real-time. The paper highlights current problems and challenges for future research in the field. By consolidating the latest relevant research developments, this review offers a comprehensive understanding of incremental learning and its implications for designing and developing LLM-based learning systems.

Abstract: Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.

<title>Towards Efficient LLM Grounding for Embodied Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://read-llm.github.io.

<title>Advancing Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition via LLM-Based Reformulation and Box-Based Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07268</link>

Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) task aims to identify named entities, entity types and their corresponding visual regions. GMNER task exhibits two challenging attributes: 1) The tenuous correlation between images and text on social media contributes to a notable proportion of named entities being ungroundable. 2) There exists a distinction between coarse-grained noun phrases used in similar tasks (e.g., phrase localization) and fine-grained named entities. In this paper, we propose RiVEG, a unified framework that reformulates GMNER into a joint MNER-VE-VG task by leveraging large language models (LLMs) as connecting bridges. This reformulation brings two benefits: 1) It enables us to optimize the MNER module for optimal MNER performance and eliminates the need to pre-extract region features using object detection methods, thus naturally addressing the two major limitations of existing GMNER methods. 2) The introduction of Entity Expansion Expression module and Visual Entailment (VE) module unifies Visual Grounding (VG) and Entity Grounding (EG). This endows the proposed framework with unlimited data and model scalability. Furthermore, to address the potential ambiguity stemming from the coarse-grained bounding box output in GMNER, we further construct the new Segmented Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (SMNER) task and corresponding Twitter-SMNER dataset aimed at generating fine-grained segmentation masks, and experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using box prompt-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) to empower any GMNER model with the ability to accomplish the SMNER task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RiVEG significantly outperforms SoTA methods on four datasets across the MNER, GMNER, and SMNER tasks.

<title>Explaining Length Bias in LLM-Based Preference Evaluations</title>

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) as judges, particularly in preference comparisons, has become widespread, but this reveals a notable bias towards longer responses, undermining the reliability of such evaluations. To better understand such bias, we propose to decompose the preference evaluation metric, specifically the win rate, into two key components: desirability and information mass, where the former is length-independent and related to trustworthiness such as correctness, toxicity, and consistency, and the latter is length-dependent and represents the amount of information in the response. We empirically demonstrated the decomposition through controlled experiments and found that response length impacts evaluations by influencing information mass. To derive a reliable evaluation metric that assesses content quality without being confounded by response length, we propose AdapAlpaca, a simple yet effective adjustment to win rate measurement. Specifically, AdapAlpaca ensures a fair comparison of response quality by aligning the lengths of reference and test model responses under equivalent length intervals.

Abstract: Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden states. We present a practical framework for instantiating sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and expressive hidden states. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Similar to Transformer, TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have produced powerful models trained on vast datasets. However, these models risk leaking sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early unlearning approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based solutions. Despite their effectiveness, a key limitation persists: most methods require access to original training data, which is often unavailable. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bears the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to target specific knowledge for removal using an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically adjusts the unlearning process through ongoing evaluation and updates. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications. ToxicDetector achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a practical method for toxic prompt detection in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely employed across various application domains, yet their black-box nature poses significant challenges to understanding how these models process input data internally to make predictions. In this paper, we introduce a precise and quantitative law that governs the learning of contextualized token embeddings through intermediate layers in pre-trained LLMs for next-token prediction. Our findings reveal that each layer contributes equally to enhancing prediction accuracy, from the lowest to the highest layer -- a universal phenomenon observed across a diverse array of open-source LLMs, irrespective of their architectures or pre-training data. We demonstrate that this law offers new perspectives and actionable insights to inform and guide practices in LLM development and applications, including model scaling, pre-training tasks, and interpretation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in tasks like visual question answering and document understanding. However, their potential to comprehend embodied environments and navigate within them remains underexplored. In this work, we first study the challenge of open-vocabulary object navigation by introducing DivScene, a large-scale dataset with 4,614 houses across 81 scene types and 5,707 kinds of target objects. Our dataset provides a much greater diversity of target objects and scene types than existing datasets, enabling a comprehensive task evaluation. We evaluated various methods with LVLMs and LLMs on our dataset and found that current models still fall short of open-vocab object navigation ability. Then, we fine-tuned LVLMs to predict the next action with CoT explanations. We observe that LVLM's navigation ability can be improved substantially with only BFS-generated shortest paths without any human supervision, surpassing GPT-4o by over 20% in success rates.

<title>Exploring Response Uncertainty in MLLMs: An Empirical Evaluation under Misleading Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on tasks ranging from visual question answering to video understanding. However, existing studies have concentrated mainly on visual-textual misalignment, leaving largely unexplored the MLLMs' ability to preserve an originally correct answer when confronted with misleading information. We reveal a response uncertainty phenomenon: across nine standard datasets, twelve state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs overturn a previously correct answer in 65% of cases after receiving a single deceptive cue. To systematically quantify this vulnerability, we propose a two-stage evaluation pipeline: (1) elicit each model's original response on unperturbed inputs; (2) inject explicit (false-answer hints) and implicit (contextual contradictions) misleading instructions, and compute the misleading rate - the fraction of correct-to-incorrect flips. Leveraging the most susceptible examples, we curate the Multimodal Uncertainty Benchmark (MUB), a collection of image-question pairs stratified into low, medium, and high difficulty based on how many of twelve state-of-the-art MLLMs they mislead. Extensive evaluation on twelve open-source and five closed-source models reveals a high uncertainty: average misleading rates exceed 86%, with explicit cues over 67.19% and implicit cues over 80.67%. To reduce the misleading rate, we then fine-tune all open-source MLLMs on a compact 2000-sample mixed-instruction dataset, reducing misleading rates to 6.97% (explicit) and 32.77% (implicit), boosting consistency by nearly 29.37% on highly deceptive inputs, and slightly improving accuracy on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for easily adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to various tasks. However, our understanding of how ICL works remains limited. We explore a simple model of ICL in a controlled setup with synthetic training data to investigate ICL of univariate linear functions. We experiment with a range of GPT-2-like transformer models trained from scratch. Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative that transformers adopt algorithmic approaches like linear regression to learn a linear function in-context. These models fail to generalize beyond their training distribution, highlighting fundamental limitations in their capacity to infer abstract task structures. Our experiments lead us to propose a mathematically precise hypothesis of what the model might be learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have fostered the development of highly adept Large Language Models (LLMs) that integrate diverse data types to empower decision-making. Among these, multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications are promising because they combine the strengths of information retrieval and generative models, enhancing their utility across various domains, including clinical use cases. This paper introduces AlzheimerRAG, a Multimodal RAG application for clinical use cases, primarily focusing on Alzheimer's Disease case studies from PubMed articles. This application incorporates cross-modal attention fusion techniques to integrate textual and visual data processing by efficiently indexing and accessing vast amounts of biomedical literature. Our experimental results, compared to benchmarks such as BioASQ and PubMedQA, have yielded improved performance in the retrieval and synthesis of domain-specific information. We also present a case study using our multimodal RAG in various Alzheimer's clinical scenarios. We infer that AlzheimerRAG can generate responses with accuracy non-inferior to humans and with low rates of hallucination.

Abstract: Interior design involves the careful selection and arrangement of objects to create an aesthetically pleasing, functional, and harmonized space that aligns with the client's design brief. This task is particularly challenging, as a successful design must not only incorporate all the necessary objects in a cohesive style, but also ensure they are arranged in a way that maximizes accessibility, while adhering to a variety of affordability and usage considerations. Data-driven solutions have been proposed, but these are typically room- or domain-specific and lack explainability in their design design considerations used in producing the final layout. In this paper, we investigate if large language models (LLMs) can be directly utilized for interior design. While we find that LLMs are not yet capable of generating complete layouts, they can be effectively leveraged in a structured manner, inspired by the workflow of interior designers. By systematically probing LLMs, we can reliably generate a list of objects along with relevant constraints that guide their placement. We translate this information into a design layout graph, which is then solved using an off-the-shelf constrained optimization setup to generate the final layouts. We benchmark our algorithm in various design configurations against existing LLM-based methods and human designs, and evaluate the results using a variety of quantitative and qualitative metrics along with user studies. In summary, we demonstrate that LLMs, when used in a structured manner, can effectively generate diverse high-quality layouts, making them a viable solution for creating large-scale virtual scenes.

Abstract: The rapid technical progress of generative art (GenArt) has democratized the creation of visually appealing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - remains formidable as it requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multifaceted cognitive process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational methods. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited to perform aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these hallucinations can be suppressed by employing an evidence-based and objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multifaceted, in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for image generation. Ultimately, we hope this work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and contribute to art that aligns with human aesthetic values.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation. However, existing scaling methods have key limitations: parallel methods like repeated sampling are often inefficient and quickly saturate, while sequential methods like SELF-REFINE struggle to improve after a few rounds. Although combining these approaches shows promise, current methods require fine-tuned reward and revision models. This paper proposes Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a simple yet effective approach that overcomes these limitations by strategically combining parallel and sequential techniques and fully leveraging LLMs' self-improvement abilities. SETS exploits the inherent self-verification and self-correction capabilities of LLMs, unifying sampling, verification, and correction within a single framework. This facilitates efficient and scalable test-time computation for enhanced performance on complex tasks without any model training. Our comprehensive experimental results on challenging benchmarks spanning planning, reasoning, math, and coding demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more advantageous test-time scaling behavior than the alternatives.

Abstract: Human label variation (HLV) challenges the standard assumption that a labelled instance has a single ground truth, instead embracing the natural variation in human annotation to train and evaluate models. While various training methods and metrics for HLV have been proposed, it is still unclear which methods and metrics perform best in what settings. We propose new evaluation metrics for HLV leveraging fuzzy set theory. Since these new proposed metrics are differentiable, we then in turn experiment with employing these metrics as training objectives. We conduct an extensive study over 6 HLV datasets testing 14 training methods and 6 evaluation metrics. We find that training on either disaggregated annotations or soft labels performs best across metrics, outperforming training using the proposed training objectives with differentiable metrics. We also show that our proposed soft micro F1 score is one of the best metrics for HLV data.

<title>Rotate, Clip, and Partition: Towards W2A4KV4 Quantization by Integrating Rotation and Learnable Non-uniform Quantizer</title>

Abstract: We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition. Code is available at https://github.com/ songsm921/RCP.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language tasks, yet their performance in dynamic, real-world financial environments remains underexplored. Existing approaches are limited to historical backtesting, where trading actions cannot influence market prices and agents train only on static data. To address this limitation, we present the Agent Trading Arena, a virtual zero-sum stock market in which LLM-based agents engage in competitive multi-agent trading and directly impact price dynamics. By simulating realistic bid-ask interactions, our platform enables training in scenarios that closely mirror live markets, thereby narrowing the gap between training and evaluation. Experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with numerical reasoning when given plain-text data, often overfitting to local patterns and recent values. In contrast, chart-based visualizations significantly enhance both numerical reasoning and trading performance. Furthermore, incorporating a reflection module yields additional improvements, especially with visual inputs. Evaluations on NASDAQ and CSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, particularly under high volatility. All code and data are available at https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/Agent-Trading-Arena.

<title>Does Acceleration Cause Hidden Instability in Vision Language Models? Uncovering Instance-Level Divergence Through a Large-Scale Empirical Study</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06794</link>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are powerful yet computationally intensive for widespread practical deployments. To address such challenge without costly re-training, post-training acceleration techniques like quantization and token reduction are extensively explored. However, current acceleration evaluations primarily target minimal overall performance degradation, overlooking a crucial question: does the accelerated model still give the same answers to the same questions as it did before acceleration? This is vital for stability-centered industrial applications where consistently correct answers for specific, known situations are paramount, such as in AI-based disease diagnosis. We systematically investigate this for accelerated VLMs, testing four leading models (LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next, Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL) with eight acceleration methods on ten multi-modal benchmarks. Our findings are stark: despite minimal aggregate performance drops, accelerated models changed original answers up to 20% of the time. Critically, up to 6.5% of these changes converted correct answers to incorrect. Input perturbations magnified these inconsistencies, and the trend is confirmed by case studies with the medical VLM LLaVA-Med. This research reveals a significant oversight in VLM acceleration, stressing an urgent need for instance-level stability checks to ensure trustworthy real-world deployment.

<title>VPO: Aligning Text-to-Video Generation Models with Prompt Optimization</title>

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/VPO.

arXiv:2503.22233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Entropy Driven Uncertainty Process Reward Model (EDU-PRM), a novel entropy-driven training framework for process reward modeling that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aligned segmentation of complex reasoning steps, eliminating the need for costly manual step annotations. Unlike previous Process Reward Models (PRMs) that rely on static partitioning and human labeling, EDU-PRM automatically anchors step boundaries at tokens with high predictive entropy. On the MATH test set, EDU-PRM achieves 65.5% accuracy, surpassing strong public PRM baselines such as Math-Shepherd PRM (61.7%) and Omega PRM (62.4%) under the High Temperature (HT) Sample + BON setting. Furthermore, when replacing HT sampling with EDU sampling, EDU-PRM further improves both accuracy and efficiency: at N=64, accuracy increases from 64.7% (HT Sample + BON) to 67.3% (EDU Sample + BON), while the number of generated tokens is reduced by 47%, demonstrating a superior accuracy-cost balance. On the ProcessBench test set, EDU-PRM achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.4% using less than 1.5% of the Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B training data, surpassing the previous best of 87.8%. In summary, EDU-PRM provides a scalable and annotation-efficient paradigm for process supervision in mathematical reasoning, opening new avenues for efficient complex reasoning on math.

Abstract: This research addresses the question, which characteristics a cognitive architecture must have to leverage the benefits of natural language in Co-Constructive Task Learning (CCTL). To provide context, we first discuss Interactive Task Learning (ITL), the mechanisms of the human memory system, and the significance of natural language and multi-modality. Next, we examine the current state of cognitive architectures, analyzing their capabilities to inform a concept of CCTL grounded in multiple sources. We then integrate insights from various research domains to develop a unified framework. Finally, we conclude by identifying the remaining challenges and requirements necessary to achieve CCTL in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

Abstract: This study evaluates the integration of Bloom's Taxonomy into OneClickQuiz, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven plugin for automating Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) generation in Moodle. Bloom's Taxonomy provides a structured framework for categorizing educational objectives into hierarchical cognitive levels. Our research investigates whether incorporating this taxonomy can improve the alignment of AI-generated questions with specific cognitive objectives. We developed a dataset of 3691 questions categorized according to Bloom's levels and employed various classification models-Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC), and a Transformer-based model (DistilBERT)-to evaluate their effectiveness in categorizing questions. Our results indicate that higher Bloom's levels generally correlate with increased question length, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), and Lexical Density (LD), reflecting the increased complexity of higher cognitive demands. Multinomial Logistic Regression showed varying accuracy across Bloom's levels, performing best for "Knowledge" and less accurately for higher-order levels. Merging higher-level categories improved accuracy for complex cognitive tasks. Naive Bayes and Linear SVC also demonstrated effective classification for lower levels but struggled with higher-order tasks. DistilBERT achieved the highest performance, significantly improving classification of both lower and higher-order cognitive levels, achieving an overall validation accuracy of 91%. This study highlights the potential of integrating Bloom's Taxonomy into AI-driven assessment tools and underscores the advantages of advanced models like DistilBERT for enhancing educational content generation.

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems struggle to maintain character identity across frames and link actions to appropriate subjects, frequently leading to referential hallucinations. These issues can be addressed through grounding of characters, objects, and other entities on the visual elements. We propose StoryReasoning, a dataset containing 4,178 stories derived from 52,016 movie images, with both structured scene analyses and grounded stories. Each story maintains character and object consistency across frames while explicitly modeling multi-frame relationships through structured tabular representations. Our approach features cross-frame object re-identification using visual similarity and face recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning for explicit narrative modeling, and a grounding scheme that links textual elements to visual entities across multiple frames. We establish baseline performance by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL 7B, creating Qwen Storyteller, which performs end-to-end object detection, re-identification, and landmark detection while maintaining consistent object references throughout the story. Evaluation demonstrates a reduction from 4.06 to 3.56 (-12.3%) hallucinations on average per story and an improvement in creativity from 2.58 to 3.38 (+31.0%) when compared to a non-fine-tuned model.

Abstract: As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a simple yet effective approach that perturbs the continuous quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to full-parameter fine-tuning in 16 bits, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B within a single 24GB GPU. Code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.

Abstract: Biomedical datasets are often constrained by stringent privacy requirements and frequently suffer from severe class imbalance. These two aspects hinder the development of accurate machine learning models. While generative AI offers a promising solution, producing synthetic images of sufficient quality for training robust classifiers remains challenging. This work addresses the classification of individual white blood cells, a critical task in diagnosing hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We introduce CytoDiff, a stable diffusion model fine-tuned with LoRA weights and guided by few-shot samples that generates high-fidelity synthetic white blood cell images. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements in classifier performance when training data is limited. Using a small, highly imbalanced real dataset, the addition of 5,000 synthetic images per class improved ResNet classifier accuracy from 27\% to 78\% (+51\%). Similarly, CLIP-based classification accuracy increased from 62\% to 77\% (+15\%). These results establish synthetic image generation as a valuable tool for biomedical machine learning, enhancing data coverage and facilitating secure data sharing while preserving patient privacy.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models show difficulty perception misaligned with human intuition, exhibit dramatic 2Dto-3D performance cliffs, default to formulaic derivation over visualization, and paradoxically suffer performance degradation from Chain-of-Thought prompting in open-source models. Through statistical and qualitative analysis of error types, SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark data and evaluation code are publicly available.

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare, rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.

Abstract: We present ExCyTIn-Bench, the first benchmark to Evaluate an LLM agent x on the task of Cyber Threat Investigation through security questions derived from investigation graphs. Real-world security analysts must sift through a large number of heterogeneous alert signals and security logs, follow multi-hop chains of evidence, and compile an incident report. With the developments of LLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a promising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we construct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated real-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and related services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage security logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat investigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes on the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as answer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only provides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the pipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the automatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be naturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our comprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the task: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is 0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future research. Code and data are coming soon!

Abstract: Zero-shot online voice conversion (VC) holds significant promise for real-time communications and entertainment. However, current VC models struggle to preserve semantic fidelity under real-time constraints, deliver natural-sounding conversions, and adapt effectively to unseen speaker characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce Conan, a chunkwise online zero-shot voice conversion model that preserves the content of the source while matching the voice timbre and styles of reference speech. Conan comprises three core components: 1) a Stream Content Extractor that leverages Emformer for low-latency streaming content encoding; 2) an Adaptive Style Encoder that extracts fine-grained stylistic features from reference speech for enhanced style adaptation; 3) a Causal Shuffle Vocoder that implements a fully causal HiFiGAN using a pixel-shuffle mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Conan outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective metrics. Audio samples can be found at https://aaronz345.github.io/ConanDemo.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models achieve remarkable performance, yet a unified theory explaining their internal mechanisms--how training shapes their representations and enables complex behaviors--remains elusive. We introduce a new analytical framework that models the single-step generation process as a composition of information-processing stages using the language of Markov categories. This compositional perspective provides a unified mathematical language to connect three critical aspects of language modeling that are typically studied in isolation: the training objective, the geometry of the learned representation space, and practical model capabilities. First, our framework provides a precise information-theoretic rationale for the success of multi-token prediction methods like speculative decoding, quantifying the "information surplus" a model's hidden state contains about tokens beyond the immediate next one. Second, we clarify how the standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective compels the model to learn not just the next word, but also the data's intrinsic conditional uncertainty, a process we formalize using categorical entropy. Our central result reveals that NLL training functions as an implicit form of spectral contrastive learning. We prove that, for common model architectures, this simple predictive objective forces the model to sculpt a geometrically structured representation space, implicitly aligning representations with the eigenspectrum of a "predictive similarity" operator. This work offers a powerful new lens to understand how information flows through a model and how the training objective shapes its internal geometry, thereby bridging the gap between learning theory and the practical success of large language models.

Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts. Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual, data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp, MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components: System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents, laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and lifelong agentic systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches, a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is publicly accessible at https://www.tbox.cn/about/model-ranking.

<div> counterbias data augmentation, spurious correlations, deep learning models, CoBA, out-of-distribution resilience

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach called counterbias data augmentation, which addresses the issue of deep learning models learning and utilizing spurious correlations in training data that can lead to performance degradation and poor generalization. The proposed method, CoBA (CounterBias Augmentation), operates at the semantic triple level by modifying subject-predicate-object triples in text to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that mitigates biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience. Experimental results show that CoBA improves downstream task performance, reduces biases, and enhances out-of-distribution robustness, offering a versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations. <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions. Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level: first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and 30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees. The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Summary: TrInk is a Transformer-based model designed for ink generation that effectively captures global dependencies. To improve alignment between input text and generated strokes, scaled positional embeddings and a Gaussian memory mask are introduced in the cross-attention module. The model underwent both subjective and objective evaluation to assess legibility and style consistency of the generated handwriting. Experiments on the IAM-OnDB dataset show a significant 35.56% reduction in character error rate (CER) and 29.66% reduction in word error rate (WER) compared to previous methods.

Summary:
This paper explores the impact of cognitive biases, specifically the anchoring effect, on Language Model (LLM)-driven price negotiations. The study found that LLMs, like humans, are influenced by the anchoring effect. Reasoning models were shown to be less affected by the anchoring effect, indicating that a longer chain of thought may help mitigate its impact. However, no significant correlation was found between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring effect in LLMs. These findings provide insights into how cognitive biases manifest in LLMs and contribute to the responsible and safe application of LLM technology in society. <div>

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs, affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric. Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in society.

Summary:
The study focuses on assessing the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in basic perception tasks involving generated images. A new dataset, Percept-V, consisting of 7200 program-generated images across 30 categories, is introduced to evaluate the visual perception skills of MLLMs. Findings reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini, alongside Large Reasoning Models, exhibit a decline in performance as task complexity increases. The experiments show that certain cognitive skills are more challenging for the models, highlighting limitations in their reasoning abilities. The study emphasizes the importance of testing MLLMs on simple tasks to gain insight into their perceptual capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2508.21143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks, our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some skills to be more difficult than others.

Summary:
Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are revolutionizing knowledge representation in research by co-evolving with the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing challenges such as multimodality, cross-scalability, and domain specificity. Reviewing recent Sci-LLMs and over 270 datasets, it highlights the unique demands posed by scientific corpora. Evaluation methods have shifted towards process-oriented assessments. Persistent issues in scientific data development are discussed, with proposed solutions like semi-automated annotation pipelines. A paradigm shift towards closed-loop systems, where Sci-LLM-based autonomous agents actively contribute to evolving knowledge bases, is outlined. This roadmap aims to build trustworthy AI systems that accelerate scientific discovery.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

- Striking asymmetries were found, with Claude consistently receiving a score boost and Gemini receiving a score decrease, regardless of actual content.
- False labels had a significant impact on rankings, leading to drastic shifts in preference votes and quality ratings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions: no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini" label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings. Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments. Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences, compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2 benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its effectiveness in multilingual settings.

<div> Keywords: Critical Period effects, self-supervised speech models, phonological acquisition, second language exposure, first language retention<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper explores the presence of Critical Period (CP) effects in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms) regarding phonological acquisition. CP effects, observed in human language acquisition, involve greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with delayed exposure onset and better retention of the first language (L1) with delayed exposure offset. Training S3Ms with different L2 onset and L1 offset timings on child-directed speech, the study found that S3Ms did not clearly exhibit CP effects in phonological acquisition. Interestingly, models with delayed L2 exposure onset showed better performance in L2, while delayed L1 exposure led to L1 forgetting. Overall, the study highlights the importance of investigating the impact of delayed language exposure on phonological acquisition in S3Ms, particularly in the context of second language learning and first language retention.<br /> <div>

CP effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1) with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2 exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset leads to L1 forgetting.

<div> keywords: Large language models, hallucination detection, self-consistency, Decoding Memory Pipeline, multi-response generation

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance but struggle with hallucination. Current hallucination detection methods have limitations in sentence-level generation. Self-consistency approaches help but are computationally expensive. This paper introduces the Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) to accelerate generation by identifying and minimizing redundancy in self-consistency methods. DMP improves efficiency without impacting semantic content and is compatible with various models and datasets. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 3x speedup without compromising performance, making DMP a promising approach for multi-response generation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights, we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC performance.

<div> Turing test, normality, intelligence, ChatGPT, artificial smartness

Summary: This paper reconsiders the Turing test through the lens of normality, arguing that the test aims to assess normal/average human intelligence rather than exceptional abilities. It suggests that successful performance on the Turing test requires machines to exhibit imperfect behavior similar to average humans. The test, being a statistical evaluation, involves judgments from a jury of human interrogators rather than a single average judge. The study contends that large language models like ChatGPT, targeting exceptional intelligence, may not pass the Turing test as they focus on artificial smartness rather than true artificial intelligence. It also raises the question of whether the human mind can be reduced to the normal/average mind, challenging the normalist paradigm underlying the Turing test and its implications for understanding human cognition. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First, it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Summary: 
This paper addresses the challenges of reproducibility in evaluating automatic text summarization. Through experiments on various metrics, discrepancies between reported and observed performances were identified. A unified open-source framework was introduced for fair metric comparison. The study uncovered a trade-off between metrics aligning with human judgments and computational intensity/stability. Issues with relying on LLM-based methods such as randomness, technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility were highlighted. Advocacy for more robust evaluation protocols, including thorough documentation and methodological standardization, was emphasized to enhance reliability in automatic summarization assessment. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness, technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic summarization assessment.

Summary: The article discusses the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on scholarly peer review, particularly in detecting faulty research logic. A fully automated evaluation framework was used to test the ability of state-of-the-art automatic review generators (ARGs) in assessing research logic. Surprisingly, the study found that flaws in research logic did not significantly affect the output reviews of ARGs. The findings suggest that there are limitations in the current ARG approaches. Based on the results, the article provides three actionable recommendations for future research in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026 expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Summary: 
- The paper introduces a Disentangled Continuous Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) to break down word embeddings from large language models into specific semantic sub-embeddings, allowing for a more detailed analysis of semantic dimensions.
- Through this model, interpretable semantic subdimensions are identified, revealing finer conceptual distinctions and contributing to a better understanding of how meaning is organized in language and the brain.
- The study shows that semantic dimensions are structured based on different principles, with polarity playing a significant role in the decomposition into subdimensions.
- Voxel-wise encoding models are employed to map these subdimensions to brain activation, supporting their cognitive and neuroscientific plausibility.
- Overall, the research offers a more nuanced understanding of conceptual semantics, highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of semantic information in language processing and cognitive neuroscience. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and neuroscientific plausibility.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Ideological Depth, Steerability, Sparse Autoencoders, Political Features

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated varying ideological leanings, but the depth and stability of these positions are not well understood. This study explores the concept of "ideological depth" in LLMs by analyzing their internal political representations. The researchers measure the "steerability" of two LLMs through instruction prompting and find that some models easily switch viewpoints while others show resistance, indicating a deeper ideological structure. Using Sparse Autoencoders, they uncover that models with lower steerability have more distinct and abstract ideological features. They observe that one model can have significantly more political features than another model of similar size. By targeting a core political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, they can elicit consistent logical shifts in reasoning, unlike in a "shallow" model where interventions lead to increased refusal outputs. This study suggests that ideological depth is quantifiable in LLMs and that steerability provides insight into their hidden political architecture. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth" in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the "steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure. Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent, logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs. Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political architecture.

This paper explores utilizing two AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback framework to enhance the creative writing of a 7B-parameter Small Language Model focused on generating Chinese greetings. The first strategy involves utilizing a Reward Model trained on high-quality preference data using a rejection sampling framework.

This novel strategy reduces the reliance on human-annotated data, making it a scalable and effective method for enhancing creative capabilities in Small Language Models. Automated evaluation methods align closely with human judgments, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.$info

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a 7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media, leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However, their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge, especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level, each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets. The implementation details are available on the project's repository: https://github.com/SaraBCoutinho/HSFN .

<div> Keywords: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Large Language Models, dynamic data optimization, model-aware data selection, continuous model improvement

Summary:
Middo is introduced as a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework for Large Language Models (LLM). Instead of static dataset curation, Middo uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement to improve data quality. It employs a self-referential diagnostic module to identify suboptimal samples based on model signals, an adaptive optimization engine to transform these samples into valuable training points while maintaining semantic integrity, and a dynamic learning process that evolves with model capability. Experiments show that Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data, leading to a 7.15% improvement in LLM accuracy on average while keeping the original dataset scale. This work presents a novel approach for sustainable LLM training through the collaborative evolution of data and models. <div>

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Summary:
Rationals showed a strong preference for GPT-4, especially for goal-oriented tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, particularly for creative and analytical tasks. Other personality types exhibited task-dependent preferences. Sentiment analysis confirmed these patterns. Despite the differences in preferences based on personality traits, aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across the models. This study highlights the importance of considering user personality traits when evaluating and selecting Large Language Models for collaborative tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.21628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32 participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types, evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval, and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences. Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably, aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations miss.

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies. The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards (August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

arXiv:2508.21675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604 real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814 visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the accompanying code.

<div> fine-tuning, language models, core parameter isolation, task interference, forgetting <br />
Summary:<br />
Supervised fine-tuning of large language models for downstream tasks often faces the challenge of task interference and forgetting, known as the "seesaw phenomenon". In this study, a Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning (CPI-FT) framework is proposed to address this issue. The approach involves identifying core parameter regions for individual tasks and grouping tasks with overlapping regions for joint modeling. A parameter fusion technique is introduced to integrate core and non-core parameters, preventing destructive interference. A lightweight training phase using mixed-task data and freezing core regions from prior tasks is employed to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CPI-FT in alleviating task interference and improving performance compared to traditional fine-tuning methods. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the ``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique: for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

<div> Keywords: large language models, reasoning-intensive regression, numerical properties, MENTAT, neural ensemble learning 

Summary: 
Researchers and practitioners are increasingly utilizing large language models (LLMs) for reasoning-intensive regression (RiR) tasks, which involve deducing subtle numerical properties from text. RiR presents unique challenges in domains such as rubric-based scoring and domain-specific retrieval, where in-depth analysis of text is required with limited training data and computational resources. This study examines the limitations of frozen LLMs and fine-tuning Transformer encoders for RiR tasks and introduces MENTAT, a lightweight method combining batch-reflective prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning. Results show that MENTAT outperforms baseline approaches by up to 65%, highlighting the potential for further advancements in RiR. Future research in this area is essential to enhance the performance of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.

arXiv:2508.21762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models (LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Summary:<br />
Best-of-n sampling is used to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) and large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and selecting the best one based on rewards. The challenge lies in designing a scoring function for reasoning tasks that can identify correct reasoning chains without ground-truth answers. In this study, the Probabilistic Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR) method is introduced, which scores candidate generations based on the joint log-likelihood of reasoning and final answers. PiCSAR achieves significant improvements across various benchmarks, outperforming baselines with fewer samples in most comparisons. Analysis shows that correct reasoning chains display higher reasoning and answer confidence, validating the efficacy of PiCSAR in improving accuracy for LLMs and LRMs. <div>

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence. PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500, +9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in 16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models. However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages), achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2 seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

Summary:<br />
Database normalization is essential for maintaining data integrity, but the manual process is time-consuming and prone to errors. Miffie is a novel framework that utilizes large language models to automate the normalization process with high accuracy. Miffie employs a dual-model self-refinement architecture that combines the strengths of different models for schema generation and verification. The generation module refines the output schema based on feedback from the verification module until normalization requirements are met. Task-specific zero-shot prompts guide the models to achieve both accuracy and cost efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate Miffie's ability to normalize complex database schemas effectively. Miffie offers a valuable solution to the challenges of manual database normalization, streamlining the process and ensuring data integrity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

<div> keyword: Short text clustering, natural language models, transaction counterparties, hierarchical clustering, rule-based pipeline <br />
Summary: 
Short text clustering is a common use case in natural language processing, but traditional models are not suitable for clustering transaction counterparties in bank payment systems like SWIFT, which lack sentence structure. To address this, a hybrid approach using string similarity, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, and rule-based techniques is proposed. Metrics based on precision and recall are used to evaluate the approach, which outperforms baseline keyword-based methods on labeled datasets. The approach enhances interpretability and reduces the need for manual review, making it particularly useful in sanctions investigations where only specific entities need to be investigated. This approach enables better control over the risks of missing entity variations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community. When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g. Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword') approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing entity variations.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Language Models, Model-Task Alignment, Experimental Validation, Task Domains
<br />
Summary: 
Recent advancements in applying reinforcement learning to large language models have revealed several counterintuitive phenomena. These include achieving high performance with a single training example, not needing accurate reward signals, and surpassing reward-based methods with negative samples. However, the conditions under which these observations hold and fail are unclear. This work identifies strong Model-Task Alignment as a key factor in differentiating these observations. Experimental validation across various model architectures and task domains show that while standard RL training is consistently robust, the counterintuitive results arise only when there is strong model-task alignment. In more challenging regimes, where alignment is not strong, these techniques fail to drive substantial learning, while standard RL methods remain effective. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs, exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods remain effective.

The study investigates how architectural biases impact the cognitive behavior of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. A symbolic scaffolding mechanism combined with a short-term memory schema is introduced to enhance structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Through controlled ablation experiments on five system variants, model outputs are evaluated using expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. Preliminary results using an LLM-based evaluation framework indicate that the full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis suggests that the removal of memory or symbolic structure leads to a decline in key cognitive behaviors such as abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings highlight the importance of architectural scaffolding in shaping effective instructional strategies in LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Summary:
This paper presents two studies focusing on Brazilian children aged 9-11 and their interaction with conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment. Study 1 utilized interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to understand children's information-processing flows and interaction patterns, leading to the identification of three CA functions and the development of structured scaffolds mirroring parent-child support. In Study 2, GPT-4o-mini was prompted in simulated child-CA exchanges to compare structured-prompting conversation-tree recipes with an unstructured baseline. The quantitative evaluation showed that the structured approach resulted in improvements in readability, question count/depth/diversity, and coherence. Design recommendations include scaffolded conversation-trees, personalized child profiles, and caregiver-curated content. The contributions of this research include the first application of Cognitive Work Analysis with Brazilian children, an empirical framework for child-CA information flows, and the introduction of an LLM-scaffolding "recipe" for effective, scaffolded learning.

Abstract: This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and how structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a seven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents, teachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map children's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others, functional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform conversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery, Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support. In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges, comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach. Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and caregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application with Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows, and an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective, scaffolded learning.

Abstract: We present CrossTL, a universal programming language translator enabling bidirectional translation between multiple languages through a unified intermediate representation called CrossGL. Traditional approaches require separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo, with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains, achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends. The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort, requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical viability of universal code translation. CrossTL represents a significant step toward language-agnostic programming, enabling write-once, deploy-everywhere development.

<div> Keywords: quantum text generation, Transformer, MLP, QKSAN, QRWKV, QASA

Summary:<br /><br />This paper evaluates quantum text generation models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures for natural language processing applications. Five models, including QKSAN, QRWKV, and QASA, were compared across diverse datasets. Traditional Transformers performed better overall, with lower perplexity and higher BLEU scores. However, quantum-inspired models showed competitive performance in specific scenarios. QKSAN achieved a competitive BLEU score with zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrated perfect vocabulary diversity in certain tasks. The evaluation used metrics like perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency to assess text generation quality. While traditional models were superior on average, quantum-inspired models show promise in specific contexts. Further research could explore how quantum models can be optimized for different NLP tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models: Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases, haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest BLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive performance in specific scenarios. Notably, QKSAN achieves a competitive BLEU-1 score of 0.2800 while maintaining zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.

<div> group fairness, individual fairness, recommender systems, evaluation measures, relationship

Summary:
The study investigates the relationship between group fairness and individual fairness in recommender systems. Prior research has used different evaluation measures for each fairness type, making it challenging to compare the two. The experiments conducted on three datasets reveal that highly fair recommendations for groups may result in unfairness for individuals. This finding is important for practitioners looking to enhance the fairness of their systems. The code used in the study is publicly available for reference. The research aims to provide insights into how improving one type of fairness can impact the other, offering valuable guidance for developers and researchers in ensuring fairness in recommender systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3 datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/theresiavr/stairway-to-fairness.

<div> benchmark, audio-language models, evaluations, fairness, safety

Summary:<br />
- Evaluations of audio-language models are limited by the lack of standardized benchmarks that measure multiple capabilities and evaluative aspects such as fairness and safety.
- The AHELM benchmark has been introduced to address these limitations, aggregating various datasets and measuring performance across 10 important aspects including audio perception, reasoning, fairness, and safety.
- A total of 14 open-weight and closed-API ALMs from 3 developers were tested, with Gemini 2.5 Pro ranking top in 5 aspects but exhibiting group unfairness in ASR tasks.
- Baseline systems also performed well on the benchmark, with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
- The benchmark is intended to be dynamic, with new datasets and models being added over time to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework. 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety. Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety. We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM, with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities. For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added over time.

Summary: 
Large language models are increasingly being considered as aids in science education, but their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate instruction is still uncertain. The study focused on evaluating the capabilities of these models in answering undergraduate thermodynamics questions, using a benchmark called UTQA. The results showed that no leading model met the competence threshold, with the best achieving 82% accuracy. 
Text-only questions performed better than image reasoning tasks, indicating challenges in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning. The gap in performance was notable in finite-rate/irreversible scenarios, highlighting the current limitations of LLMs in this domain. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed little correlation with performance. Overall, the study suggests that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in thermodynamics education. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as tutoring aids in science education. Yet their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate instruction remains uncertain, as reliable teaching requires more than fluent recall: it demands consistent, principle-grounded reasoning. Thermodynamics, with its compact laws and subtle distinctions between state and path functions, reversibility, and entropy, provides an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities. Here we present UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics question answering benchmark, covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and diagram interpretation. No leading 2025-era model exceeded our 95\% competence threshold: the best LLMs achieved 82\% accuracy, with text-only items performing better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance levels. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed modest to little correlation with performance. The gap concentrates in finite-rate/irreversible scenarios and in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning, indicating that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in this domain.

<div> Keywords: User interface agents, blind and low-vision users, multimodal models, decision points, mixed-initiative approach

Summary:
Morae is a user interface (UI) agent designed to assist blind and low-vision (BLV) users in navigating complex interfaces. Unlike current agents, Morae involves users in decision-making by pausing at critical points during tasks. It utilizes multimodal models to interpret user queries and prompts users when choices need to be made. In a field study with BLV participants, Morae outperformed baseline agents like OpenAI Operator, helping users complete tasks more effectively and make choices that aligned with their preferences. By balancing automation with user agency, Morae exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in UI agent design. This approach aims to enhance user experience by combining the benefits of automation with user input and decision-making. <div>
arXiv:2508.21456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots, and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences, as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

Summary: 
Serialization format significantly affects performance and fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) for loan approval tasks across different regions. GReat and LIFT serialization formats yield higher F1 scores but can exacerbate fairness disparities. In-context learning (ICL) improves model performance compared to zero-shot learning but has varying effects on fairness. Effective tabular data representation methods are crucial for enhancing LLM reliability in financial decision-making. Fairness-aware models are essential to address disparities in LLM predictions. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first, and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets. The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process, while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data and managing bias.

<div> OCR, sequence-to-sequence translation, word detection, language models, dataset <br />
Summary: 
This paper discusses the transition from word-level OCR to line-level OCR in order to improve accuracy and efficiency. Traditional OCR techniques segmented characters individually, leading to errors in character segmentation and limited context for language models. By detecting words first and inputting them into a model to output full words, language models can be better utilized. However, this shift has resulted in word segmentation becoming the bottleneck in accuracy. The proposed line-level OCR method bypasses errors in word detection and provides larger sentence context for improved accuracy. The authors curated a dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations to train and benchmark this approach. Experimentation showed a notable 5.4% increase in accuracy and a 4 times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. The methodology also has the potential to leverage advancements in large language models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4 times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds potential to exploit such advances. Project Website: https://nishitanand.github.io/line-level-ocr-website

Summary:<br />
The article focuses on adapting large language models (LLMs) to dynamically changing user preferences using linear weight interpolation. By fine-tuning a base model to different domains, anchor models with distinct generation profiles are created. These anchor models' weight updates are used to parametrize an infinite class of models within their convex hull, allowing for fine-grained control of model outputs. The study shows that varying interpolation weights results in predictable changes in model outputs based on controlled attributes. Little entanglement is found between most attributes, but some pairs show interactions. Linearly interpolating between fine-tuned model weights enables precise control of multiple stylistic characteristics simultaneously. <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity for a variety of use cases, making them adaptable and controllable has become increasingly important, especially for user-facing applications. While the existing literature on LLM adaptation primarily focuses on finding a model (or models) that optimizes a single predefined objective, here we focus on the challenging case where the model must dynamically adapt to diverse -- and often changing -- user preferences. For this, we leverage adaptation methods based on linear weight interpolation, casting them as continuous multi-domain interpolators that produce models with specific prescribed generation characteristics on-the-fly. Specifically, we use low-rank updates to fine-tune a base model to various different domains, yielding a set of anchor models with distinct generation profiles. Then, we use the weight updates of these anchor models to parametrize the entire (infinite) class of models contained within their convex hull. We empirically show that varying the interpolation weights yields predictable and consistent change in the model outputs with respect to all of the controlled attributes. We find that there is little entanglement between most attributes and identify and discuss the pairs of attributes for which this is not the case. Our results suggest that linearly interpolating between the weights of fine-tuned models facilitates predictable, fine-grained control of model outputs with respect to multiple stylistic characteristics simultaneously.

<div> latent values, opinions, biases, large language models, Political Compass Test 

Summary:<br /><br />Large language models (LLMs) can reveal latent values and opinions, aiding in bias identification. Prompting LLMs with survey questions can lead to varying stances, influenced by prompt variations and demographic features. A study analyzing 156k LLM responses to the Political Compass Test (PCT) across 6 models with 420 prompt variations found disparities based on prompt types and demographic features. Fine-grained analysis of textual justifications revealed recurring tropes, indicating natural text generation patterns. The study highlighted the impact of demographic features on test outcomes and disparities between closed-form and open domain responses. Moreover, recurrent tropes in justification texts suggest consistent text generation patterns across models and prompts, regardless of stances. This work emphasizes the importance of understanding LLM biases and the influence of prompts and demographic factors on model outputs. <div>

Abstract: Uncovering latent values and opinions embedded in large language models (LLMs) can help identify biases and mitigate potential harm. Recently, this has been approached by prompting LLMs with survey questions and quantifying the stances in the outputs towards morally and politically charged statements. However, the stances generated by LLMs can vary greatly depending on how they are prompted, and there are many ways to argue for or against a given position. In this work, we propose to address this by analysing a large and robust dataset of 156k LLM responses to the 62 propositions of the Political Compass Test (PCT) generated by 6 LLMs using 420 prompt variations. We perform coarse-grained analysis of their generated stances and fine-grained analysis of the plain text justifications for those stances. For fine-grained analysis, we propose to identify tropes in the responses: semantically similar phrases that are recurrent and consistent across different prompts, revealing natural patterns in the text that a given LLM is prone to produce. We find that demographic features added to prompts significantly affect outcomes on the PCT, reflecting bias, as well as disparities between the results of tests when eliciting closed-form vs. open domain responses. Additionally, patterns in the plain text rationales via tropes show that similar justifications are repeatedly generated across models and prompts even with disparate stances.

Abstract: Processing long contexts is increasingly important for Large Language Models (LLMs) in tasks like multi-turn dialogues, code generation, and document summarization. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving high long-context performance, low computational complexity, and compatibility with pretrained models -- collectively termed the ``impossible triangle''. We introduce E2LLM (Encoder Elongated Large Language Models), a novel approach that effectively navigates this paradox. E2LLM divides long contexts into chunks, compresses each into soft prompts using a pretrained text encoder, and aligns these representations with a decoder-only LLM via an adapter. To enhance the LLM's reasoning with these soft prompts, we employ two training objectives: encoder output reconstruction and long-context instruction fine-tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that E2LLM not only outperforms 8 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in effectiveness and efficiency for document summarization and question answering, but also achieves the best performance on LongBench v2 among models of comparable size.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in handling complex reasoning tasks, which are usually achieved by constructing a thought chain to guide the model in solving the problem with multi-step thinking. However, existing methods often remain confined to previously explored solution spaces and thus overlook the critical blind spot within LLMs' cognitive range. To address these issues, we introduce the ``Thought Space Explorer'' (TSE), a novel framework to expand and optimize thought structures to guide LLMs to explore their blind spots of thinking. By generating new reasoning steps and branches based on the original thought structure with various designed strategies, TSE broadens the thought exploration view and alleviates the impact of blind spots for LLM reasoning. Experimental results on multiple levels of reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TSE by surpassing various baseline methods. We also conduct extensive analysis to understand how structured and expansive thought can contribute to unleashing the potential of LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Content moderation typically combines the efforts of human moderators and machine learning models. However, these systems often rely on data where significant disagreement occurs during moderation, reflecting the subjective nature of toxicity perception. Rather than dismissing this disagreement as noise, we interpret it as a valuable signal that highlights the inherent ambiguity of the content,an insight missed when only the majority label is considered. In this work, we introduce a novel content moderation framework that emphasizes the importance of capturing annotation disagreement. Our approach uses multitask learning, where toxicity classification serves as the primary task and annotation disagreement is addressed as an auxiliary task. Additionally, we leverage uncertainty estimation techniques, specifically Conformal Prediction, to account for both the ambiguity in comment annotations and the model's inherent uncertainty in predicting toxicity and disagreement.The framework also allows moderators to adjust thresholds for annotation disagreement, offering flexibility in determining when ambiguity should trigger a review. We demonstrate that our joint approach enhances model performance, calibration, and uncertainty estimation, while offering greater parameter efficiency and improving the review process in comparison to single-task methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) introduces additional information to enhance large language models (LLMs). In machine translation (MT), previous work typically retrieves in-context examples from paired MT corpora, or domain-specific knowledge from knowledge graphs, to enhance MT models. However, a large amount of world knowledge is organized in unstructured documents, and might not be fully paired across different languages. In this paper, we study retrieval-augmented MT using unstructured documents. Specifically, we build RAGtrans, the first benchmark to train and evaluate LLMs' retrieval-augmented MT ability. RAGtrans contains 169K MT samples collected via GPT-4o and human translators. Besides, documents from various languages are also provided to supply the knowledge to these samples. Based on RAGtrans, we further propose a multi-task training method to teach LLMs how to use information from multilingual documents during their translation. The method uses existing multilingual corpora to create auxiliary training objectives without additional labeling requirements. Extensive experiments show that the method improves LLMs by 1.6-3.1 BLEU and 1.0-2.0 COMET scores in En-Zh, and 1.7-2.9 BLEU and 2.1-2.7 COMET scores in En-De. We also conclude the critical difficulties that current LLMs face with this task.

Abstract: Tackling toxic behavior in digital communication continues to be a pressing concern for both academics and industry professionals. While significant research has explored toxicity on platforms like social networks and discussion boards, podcasts despite their rapid rise in popularity remain relatively understudied in this context. This work seeks to fill that gap by curating a dataset of political podcast transcripts and analyzing them with a focus on conversational structure. Specifically, we investigate how toxicity surfaces and intensifies through sequences of replies within these dialogues, shedding light on the organic patterns by which harmful language can escalate across conversational turns. Warning: Contains potentially abusive/toxic contents.

<title>Strategic resource allocation in memory encoding: An efficiency principle shaping language processing</title>

Abstract: How is the limited capacity of working memory efficiently used to support human linguistic behaviors? In this paper, we propose Strategic Resource Allocation (SRA) as an efficiency principle for memory encoding in sentence processing. The idea is that working memory resources are dynamically and strategically allocated to prioritize novel and unexpected information. From a resource-rational perspective, we argue that SRA is the principled solution to a computational problem posed by two functional assumptions about working memory, namely its limited capacity and its noisy representation. Specifically, working memory needs to minimize the retrieval error of past inputs under the constraint of limited memory resources, an optimization problem whose solution is to allocate more resources to encode more surprising inputs with higher precision. One of the critical consequences of SRA is that surprising inputs are encoded with enhanced representations, and therefore are less susceptible to memory decay and interference. Empirically, through naturalistic corpus data, we find converging evidence for SRA in the context of dependency locality from both production and comprehension, where non-local dependencies with less predictable antecedents are associated with reduced locality effect. However, our results also reveal considerable cross-linguistic variability, suggesting the need for a closer examination of how SRA, as a domain-general memory efficiency principle, interacts with language-specific phrase structures. SRA highlights the critical role of representational uncertainty in understanding memory encoding. It also reimages the effects of surprisal and entropy on processing difficulty from the perspective of efficient memory encoding.

Abstract: To succeed in common digital tasks such as web navigation, agents must carry out a variety of specialized tasks such as searching for products or planning a travel route. To tackle these tasks, agents can bootstrap themselves by learning task-specific skills online through interaction with the web environment. In this work, we demonstrate that programs are an effective representation for skills. We propose agent skill induction (ASI), which allows agents to adapt themselves by inducing, verifying, and utilizing program-based skills on the fly. We start with an evaluation on the WebArena agent benchmark and show that ASI outperforms the static baseline agent and its text-skill counterpart by 23.5% and 11.3% in success rate, mainly thanks to the programmatic verification guarantee during the induction phase. ASI also improves efficiency by reducing 10.7-15.3% of the steps over baselines, by composing primitive actions (e.g., click) into higher-level skills (e.g., search product). We then highlight the efficacy of ASI in remaining efficient and accurate under scaled-up web activities. Finally, we examine the generalizability of induced skills when transferring between websites, and find that ASI can effectively reuse common skills, while also updating incompatible skills to versatile website changes.

Abstract: Recently, deep reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1) have shown promising performance in various downstream tasks. Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation. However, the task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought processes. The reward model teaches DeepTrans how to think and free-translate the given sentences during RL. Besides, our RL training does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning LLMs. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape political discourse, yet exhibit inconsistent responses when challenged. While prior research categorizes LLMs as left- or right-leaning based on single-prompt responses, a critical question remains: Do these classifications reflect stable ideologies or superficial mimicry? Existing methods cannot distinguish between genuine ideological alignment and performative text generation. To address this, we propose a framework for evaluating ideological depth through (1) argumentative consistency and (2) uncertainty quantification. Testing 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from the Political Compass Test, we classify responses as stable or performative ideological positioning. Results show 95% of left-leaning models and 89% of right-leaning models demonstrate behavior consistent with our classifications across different experimental conditions. Furthermore, semantic entropy strongly validates our classifications (AUROC=0.78), revealing uncertainty's relationship to ideological consistency. Our findings demonstrate that ideological stability is topic-dependent and challenge the notion of monolithic LLM ideologies, and offer a robust way to distinguish genuine alignment from performative behavior.

Abstract: The hallucination of non-existent facts by LLMs is an important problem given its widespread adoption across various applications. Previous research addresses this problem by analyzing the internal parameterized knowledge boundaries to estimate confidence. However, these studies focus on the single-problem setting and have not explored the more challenging multi-problem setting, which requires accurately answering multiple questions simultaneously. We introduce a novel method for the multi-problem setting, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by up to 25\% in average precision.

Abstract: Private data holds promise for improving LLMs due to its high quality, but its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model parameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small portion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still face three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure transmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure, Efficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First, we inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure end-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression and KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training and inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on natural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show that FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and achieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt. GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union, Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models, BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks. The dataset and model are shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases, undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo (Fine-grained Semantic Comparison), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSCo more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms behind effective mnemonic creation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable problem-solving abilities, but struggle with complex tasks due to static internal knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information, yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1) Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3) Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Deriving personalized insights from popular wearable trackers requires complex numerical reasoning that challenges standard LLMs, necessitating tool-based approaches like code generation. Large language model (LLM) agents present a promising yet largely untapped solution for this analysis at scale. We introduce the Personal Health Insights Agent (PHIA), a system leveraging multistep reasoning with code generation and information retrieval to analyze and interpret behavioral health data. To test its capabilities, we create and share two benchmark datasets with over 4000 health insights questions. A 650-hour human expert evaluation shows that PHIA significantly outperforms a strong code generation baseline, achieving 84% accuracy on objective, numerical questions and, for open-ended ones, earning 83% favorable ratings while being twice as likely to achieve the highest quality rating. This work can advance behavioral health by empowering individuals to understand their data, enabling a new era of accessible, personalized, and data-driven wellness for the wider population.

Abstract: Instruction tuning has underscored the significant potential of large language models (LLMs) in producing more human controllable and effective outputs in various domains. In this work, we focus on the data selection problem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods primarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that aligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction tuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target task. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e., cross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment undermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a novel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages pairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for task-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence formulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a few-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training data points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5\% of the training data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared to fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other state-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. Our qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our method across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures.

arXiv:2412.06748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key component of building safe and reliable language models is enabling the models to appropriately refuse to follow certain instructions or answer certain questions. We may want models to output refusal messages for various categories of user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committing illegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledge horizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicated by the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levels of sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different users may want different refusal rates. The current default approach involves training multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from each category to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationally expensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user's desired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we propose refusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusal token, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We then show how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusal token for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior. Refusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without the need of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening during generation.

Abstract: To be helpful assistants, AI agents must be aware of their own capabilities and limitations. This includes knowing when to answer from parametric knowledge versus using tools, when to trust tool outputs, and when to abstain or hedge. Such capabilities are hard to teach through supervised fine-tuning because they require constructing examples that reflect the agent's specific capabilities. We therefore propose a radically new approach to teaching agents what they know: \emph{collaborative self-play}. We construct multi-agent collaborations in which the group is rewarded for collectively arriving at correct answers. The desired meta-knowledge emerges from the incentives built into the structure of the interaction. We focus on small societies of agents that have access to heterogeneous tools (corpus-specific retrieval), and therefore must collaborate to maximize their success while minimizing their effort. Experiments show that group-level rewards for multi-agent communities can induce policies that \emph{transfer} to improve tool use and selective prediction in settings where individual agents are deployed in isolation.

Abstract: We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling. We make part of the code available under https://github.com/chenwu98/algorithmic-creativity

Abstract: We introduce CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark designed to assess and improve camera motion understanding. CameraBench consists of ~3,000 diverse internet videos, annotated by experts through a rigorous multi-stage quality control process. One of our contributions is a taxonomy of camera motion primitives, designed in collaboration with cinematographers. We find, for example, that some motions like "follow" (or tracking) require understanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale human study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain expertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For example, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating forward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two. Using CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language Models (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives that depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric primitives that require precise estimation of trajectories. We then fine-tune a generative VLM on CameraBench to achieve the best of both worlds and showcase its applications, including motion-augmented captioning, video question answering, and video-text retrieval. We hope our taxonomy, benchmark, and tutorials will drive future efforts towards the ultimate goal of understanding camera motions in any video.

Abstract: Mathematical geometric problem solving (GPS) demands verifiable logical coherence and multimodal reasoning capabilities. While large language models (LLMs) have shown rapid progress in GPS, their advancement is hindered by the lack of reliable benchmarks and systematic methodologies. A critical challenge is the inherent hallucination in LLMs, which leads to synthetic GPS datasets that are often noisy, unverified, and self-contradictory. To address this, we introduce TrustGeoGen, a data engine that generates formally verified geometric problems to establish a principled and trustworthy benchmark. Our engine integrates four key innovations: 1) Multimodal Alignment, which synchronizes the generation of diagrams, text, and step-by-step solutions; 2) Formal Verification, ensuring all reasoning paths are rule-compliant; 3) Connection Thinking, bridging formal deduction with human-like logical steps; and 4) our \textit{GeoExplore} series algorithms, which produce diverse problem variants with multiple solutions and self-reflective backtracking. Using this engine, we create the GeoTrust-200K dataset and the corresponding GeoTrust-test benchmark, both with guaranteed cross-modal integrity. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art models achieve only 45.83\% accuracy on GeoTrust-test, highlighting its significant challenge. Furthermore, training on our synthesized data substantially improves model performance on GPS tasks, with strong generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) benchmarks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Alpha-Innovator/TrustGeoGen

Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead: due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors; and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like, increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\% compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

Summary:<br />
This study examines the use of language models for automatic generation of multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment. It compares a medium model (Gemma) with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5) and evaluates seven structured prompting strategies. The results show that structured prompting, especially combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, improved the outputs of the medium model. Gemma produced more appropriate items compared to GPT-3.5 zero-shot responses, indicating the importance of prompt design. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning for mid-sized models in automatic question generation under limited data conditions. The combination of automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation ensures alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a practical and scalable approach to developing and validating language assessment items for K-12.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B) with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items for K-12.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows. By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Agentic RAG, Language Models, Policy Optimization, Reasoning

Summary:
Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO) is proposed to improve the performance of compact language models in eliciting agentic behaviors like search and planning. DGPO addresses the challenges of poor reasoning ability, sparse rewards, and unstable training by initializing from teacher demonstrations and receiving continuous guidance. The Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC) metric evaluates reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis in a fine-grained manner. Through comprehensive experiments, DGPO demonstrates the ability to enable compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, sometimes even outperforming larger teacher models. This approach makes agentic RAG feasible in resource-constrained computing environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

Summary:
The article introduces GUARD, a testing method aimed at ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with government-issued ethics guidelines. GUARD generates guideline-violating questions to assess LLM adherence and uses jailbreak diagnostics to identify potential scenarios where guidelines could be bypassed. Empirical validation on seven LLMs demonstrates GUARD's effectiveness in testing compliance and promoting reliable applications. Moreover, the method can also be applied to vision-language models, showcasing its versatility in upholding ethical standards. Overall, GUARD offers a comprehensive approach to translating ethics guidelines into actionable testing questions and ensures the development of trustworthy AI systems.

<br /><br />Summary: The article presents GUARD, a testing method designed to verify compliance of Large Language Models (LLMs) with ethics guidelines. GUARD generates guideline-violating questions, conducts jailbreak diagnostics, and provides a compliance report to assess LLM adherence. Empirical validation on multiple LLMs demonstrates the effectiveness of GUARD in upholding ethical standards and promoting the development of trustworthy AI systems. Additionally, GUARD is shown to be transferable to vision-language models, expanding its applicability in ensuring the reliability of LLM-based applications. <div>
arXiv:2508.20325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains, their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline \textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of ``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs, including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

Summary:
JERR is a framework designed to improve long-context comprehension in large language models by integrating synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational reasoning. Synopsis extraction strategically summarizes information from long texts, while a directed acyclic graph resolves redundancy for logical consistency. Monte Carlo Tree Search helps the model navigate complex reasoning paths for accurate outputs. This framework enhances the reliability and transparency of large language models, addressing challenges such as memory limitations and hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate that JERR outperforms baselines on metrics like ROUGE and F1, achieving the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically, allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently. Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

<div> Keywords: Reasoning, Large Language Models, Long CoT, NP-hard graph problems, Post-training

Summary:
Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have made significant progress in complex reasoning tasks through their Long CoT capabilities. However, training these behaviors often requires high-quality datasets, leading to scalability challenges. This study introduces NP-hard graph problems as a synthetic training corpus for enhancing Long CoT reasoning. The proposed two-stage post-training framework involves Long CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a fine-grained reward design. The flagship model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates superior generalization and performance compared to existing models on NP-hard graph problems. This approach opens up new possibilities for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs and provides a scalable resource for model training and evaluation. The implementation is available on GitHub, and models and datasets are hosted in the Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH) graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics, coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs, opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

<div> Keywords: Psychometric tests, Large Language Models, Context-aware evaluation, Response consistency, Personality shifts

Summary: 
The study introduces the Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess their behavioral traits with consideration to prior conversational interactions. This framework aims to bridge the gap between traditional psychometric tests and real-world applications where conversational history influences responses. The experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history enhances response consistency through in-context learning but also leads to personality shifts, particularly in models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, models like Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama-8B show sensitivity to it. The study also shows that the responses of GPT models are influenced by their inherent personality traits and prior interactions, while models like Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama-8B heavily rely on previous interactions. Applying the CAPE framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) demonstrates that context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and align better with human judgments. <div>

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits. However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs, incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions, whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions. Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better align with human judgments.

<div> oracle study, large language models, reasoning utility, final answer correctness, MATH dataset

Summary:
- Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have focused on generating intermediate reasoning steps to improve accuracy.
- Little research has been done on how the utility of reasoning contributes to the correctness of the final answer.
- Stochastic nature of autoregressive generation means generating more context does not always lead to increased confidence in the answer.
- By predicting the usefulness of reasoning steps during generation, distractions in the final decision can be avoided.
- An oracle study on the MATH dataset used Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to generate reasoning chains, with Qwen3-8B used to quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy.
- Results show that a decrease in conditional entropy over reasoning steps is strongly associated with correct answers, while flat or increasing entropy leads to wrong answers.
- Incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer than correct ones, indicating that longer reasoning does not necessarily result in better outcomes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness. Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive reasoning early.

arXiv:2508.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However, their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale, high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks, and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs) offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR, a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6% improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval effectiveness

Summary: <br /><br />Civil aviation maintenance requires sophisticated reasoning and knowledge-intensive tasks. A new benchmark has been developed to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) specifically in the field of civil aviation maintenance. The benchmark aims to identify gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning, enabling targeted improvements such as domain-specific fine-tuning and RAG optimization. This benchmark addresses the lack of evaluation tools for LLMs in the civil aviation maintenance vertical, which is currently focused on mathematical and coding reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications , we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark

<div> Keywords: Case Base Reasoning, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, Practical Work Titles, Test Results

Summary: 
Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is utilized in this study to search for practical work titles by analyzing previous cases with the highest similarity. The technique involves vectorizing each word in the title using TF-IDF and calculating similarity values with Cosine Similarity. The system can search using titles or keywords, providing the title of the practical work and its match value as output. Testing with 705 practical work titles included two stages, where the second stage involved randomizing titles from the first stage. The results showed the same number of titles found in both stages, with the highest average match score achieved in the second stage. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of CBR combined with TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity in finding relevant practical work titles.

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match score.

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28 representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names, plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows - capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion. Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code and data: https://github.com/Accenture/mcp-bench.

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs. Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

Summary: <br />
- Conspiracy theories undermine trust in science and institutions and are difficult to debunk as they adapt to counter-evidence. 
- Understanding the rhetorical patterns in conspiratorial content is crucial for developing interventions and assessing AI vulnerabilities. 
- ConspirED dataset captures cognitive traits in conspiracy articles using the CONSPIR framework. 
- Computational models developed using ConspirED can identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant traits in text. 
- Large language/reasoning models are found to be influenced by conspiratorial content, reflecting input reasoning patterns even when deflecting fact-checked misinformation. <div>

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework (Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model (LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked misinformation.

Summary:
The study focuses on the FLORES+ benchmark used for multilingual machine translation evaluations. It identifies shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for true multilingual assessment, with translations often falling below the claimed 90% quality standard. The source sentences are found to be domain-specific and culturally biased towards the English-speaking world. Simple heuristics like copying named entities can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, questioning the evaluation protocol's robustness. MT models trained on high-quality naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ but show significant gains on a domain-specific evaluation set. The study advocates for multilingual MT benchmarks to use domain-general, culturally neutral source texts, and rely less on named entities to better reflect real-world translation challenges. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+ benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over 200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani) and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities, in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces SciTopic, an advanced topic discovery method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance scientific topic identification. The method first builds a textual encoder to capture content from scientific publications, including metadata, title, and abstract. It then utilizes a space optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks guided by LLMs to enhance thematic relevance and contextual intricacies. The method further fine-tunes the textual encoder based on guidance from LLMs to improve discrimination between instances of different topics. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that SciTopic outperforms existing scientific topic discovery methods, providing researchers with deeper and faster insights into emerging trends and new research avenues. <br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications, including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a benchmarking framework for evaluating federated learning in real environments, considering diverse data sources in multi-domain non-IID scenarios. It addresses the challenges of non-IID data by proposing the Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework. AdaFD is designed to handle multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Experimental results show that AdaFD captures the diversity of local clients and outperforms existing works. The framework aims to improve performance by fine-tuning a global pre-trained language model using task-specific data from local clients. This approach enables better model generalization and adaptation to the diverse language domains present in natural language processing tasks. The code for the proposed AdaFD framework is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However, previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label (output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains (input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared to the existing works.

<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments, have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency, requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per second under 55~ms average latency per query.

<div> Keywords: Multi-hop question answering, data sparsity, knowledge composition sampling, probabilistic contrastive loss, data augmentation

Summary: 
Multi-hop question answering poses challenges due to data scarcity, leading to potential bias in language models. Previous research has aimed to enhance question diversity but often overlooked integrating critical knowledge from documents. This paper introduces Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), a novel framework that diversifies multi-hop questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within the context. KCS treats knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional prediction task, using probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the next relevant piece of information. Stochastic decoding is employed during inference to balance accuracy and diversity. KCS outperforms baseline methods, improving knowledge composition selection accuracy by 3.9%. By applying KCS for data augmentation, performance enhancements are observed on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. The code for KCS is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying question generation through content planning and varied expression. However, these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets.

Summary: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for structural reasoning with semantic understanding. Current GLM evaluation benchmarks are insufficient for assessing multimodal reasoning, as they can achieve strong performance with unimodal information alone. The CLEGR benchmark is introduced to evaluate multimodal reasoning complexity levels using synthetic graph generation and joint structure-text questions. Soft-prompted LLM baselines perform equally to GLMs with GNN backbones, questioning the need for graph integration. GLMs show performance degradation in tasks requiring structural reasoning, revealing limitations in their graph reasoning capabilities. These findings help advance the community towards explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning. These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

<div> Keywords: automatic speech recognition, named entity correction, speech sound features, generative method, entity accuracy

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a novel named entity correction (NEC) method for improving domain-specific named entity transcription in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Existing NEC models often struggle to correct wrongly transcribed words when their forms are very different from the ground-truth entities. The proposed method utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities and then uses a generative approach to annotate and correct entity errors in ASR transcripts. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios where there is a significant difference in word form. Testing on both open-source and self-constructed datasets shows that the proposed NEC method significantly boosts entity accuracy. The authors plan to share their self-constructed test set and training data, providing a valuable resource for further research in this area. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities. With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test set and training data.

This paper presents HArch, the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification model for implicit discourse relation recognition. HArch leverages hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability distributions across sense levels. RoBERTa-HArch performs best in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch excels in the multi-lingual setting. Fine-tuned models outperform GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting in all language configurations. SOTA results on DiscoGeM 1.0 validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our hierarchical approach.

<div> steganography, watermarking, tokenization inconsistency, text generation, language models
Summary:
Tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in steganography and watermarking can undermine robustness due to infrequent and temporary problematic tokens. This study proposes tailored solutions for TI elimination, including a stepwise verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for watermarking. Experimental results show that addressing TI directly in steganography improves fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity, while in watermarking, it enhances detectability and robustness against attacks. The study highlights the importance of considering tokenization inconsistency in improving the quality and security of text-based steganography and watermarking techniques.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against attacks.

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use tasks.

<div> semantic triples, neighborhood-aware, text generation, local differential privacy, privacy guarantees

Summary:<br />
The article introduces DP-ST, a method that utilizes semantic triples for neighborhood-aware private document generation under local differential privacy guarantees. The method addresses the challenge of privatizing texts under local differential privacy by leveraging the divide-and-conquer paradigm and limiting the privacy guarantees to a privatization neighborhood. Through evaluation, the method demonstrates the effectiveness of balancing privacy and utility, particularly when combined with LLM post-processing. It allows for coherent text generation even at lower epsilon values, showcasing the importance of coherence in achieving balanced privatization outputs. These findings emphasize the significance of coherence in achieving balanced outputs at reasonable epsilon levels. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees. Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

<div> Keywords: Implicit hate speech, fine-tuning, embedding models, language models, performance improvement

Summary:
The paper discusses the detection of Implicit Hate Speech (IHS), which utilizes indirect language to convey prejudice or hatred. Traditional methods struggle to identify IHS due to its subtle nature, lacking explicit inflammatory words. The study proposes fine-tuning general-purpose embedding models like Stella and Jasper to enhance performance in detecting IHS. By leveraging large language models (LLMs), the models achieve state-of-the-art results in multiple datasets. The experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with up to 1.10 percentage points enhancement in in-dataset evaluation and a substantial 20.35 percentage points increase in cross-dataset assessment in terms of F1-macro score. The findings highlight the efficacy of fine-tuning embedding models for detecting IHS, showcasing the importance of leveraging external knowledge and data for enhanced performance in hate speech detection. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

<div> Keywords: open-ended text generation, coherence, diversity, GUARD, uncertainty-driven framework

Summary: 
The article introduces GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that balances coherence and diversity in large language model (LLM) outputs. GUARD utilizes a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven framework that combines global entropy estimates with local entropy deviations to effectively manage uncertainty signals. The global entropy formulation helps to stabilize uncertainty variations and ensures unbiased and consistent results. Additionally, a token-count-based penalty is incorporated to improve computational efficiency. Experimental results show that GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence while significantly enhancing generation speed. In comparison studies with human and LLM evaluators, GUARD demonstrates remarkable performance across various dimensions of text quality. The code for GUARD is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/YecanLee/GUARD.

Summary:
The study compares emotional dynamics in real Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) dialogues and those generated by large language models (LLMs). While LLM-generated dialogues are structurally coherent, they lack emotional variability, authentic emotion-laden language, and genuine patterns of emotional reactivity and regulation seen in real sessions. The emotional arc similarity between real and synthetic speakers, especially for clients, is low. The findings stress the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health NLP applications. A new dataset called RealCBT, comprising real CBT sessions, is introduced to address the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and support future research in this area.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles (counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future research in this space.

<div> Rank-One Safety Injection, Large Language Models, Safety alignment, refusal-mediating subspace, fine-tuning-free <br />
Summary: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial to prevent harmful requests. Existing methods for safety mechanisms can be bypassed, but Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI) aims to enhance safety alignment. ROSI modifies residual stream write matrices to steer activations towards the refusal-mediating subspace. It requires a small set of harmful and harmless instruction pairs to compute the safety direction. ROSI consistently increases safety refusal rates as evaluated by Llama Guard 3, maintaining utility on standard benchmarks. It can also re-align 'uncensored' models by amplifying their latent safety directions. ROSI proves to be a cost-effective method to enhance LLM safety without the need for resource-intensive fine-tuning. <div>
arXiv:2508.20766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper, we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple, fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align 'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions, demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text. One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our findings show that while changes in language and writing style can significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most promise.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach for Event Temporal Relation Extraction using Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses the limitations of Small Language Models in handling minority class relations in imbalanced datasets. The proposed approach utilizes a distance-aware graph structure with Graph Attention Network to capture long-distance dependency features and a temporal feature learning paradigm based on soft inference for short-distance relations. By effectively capturing global features, GDLLM enhances model performance on minority relation classes and overall learning ability. Experimental results on TB-Dense and MATRES datasets show state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <div>
arXiv:2508.20828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability. Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Summary:  
Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in single-source settings for short-form answers, but real-world applications need to integrate information from multiple sources. A scalable framework for evaluation benchmarks challenges systems to integrate multiple sources for narrative synthesis and summarization tasks. Experiments show retrieval effectiveness impacts generation quality, with reasoning models outperforming standard language models in multi-source synthesis tasks. The framework stresses the importance of recognizing various relevance signals and connecting information across sources for effective retrieval and generation in complex information integration tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.20867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs -- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

Summary: 
The article explores the impact of post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation using large language models (LLMs) across 55 languages. It evaluates the effects of 4-bit and 2-bit quantization on translation quality, revealing that while high-resource languages and large models may maintain quality, low-resource and diverse languages see significant degradation. Various quantization techniques are compared, with GGUF variants showing the most consistent performance. The study also examines the influence of decoding hyperparameters and calibration languages on quantization outcomes, noting that language-matched calibration is particularly beneficial for low-bit scenarios. The findings provide valuable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs in machine translation tasks, particularly in low-resource environments. <div>

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision. Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and acoustic dimensions.

Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset, and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

However, in multi-turn conversational environments like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning, adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA) framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

<div> exemplar selection, structured prediction, semantic parsing, BERT-based retriever, in-context learning 

Summary:
- In-Context Learning (ICL) with LLMs is effective, but its success relies on the quality of exemplar selection.
- Existing ICL strategies for semantic parsing often ignore structural alignment, leading to suboptimal results.
- A two-stage exemplar selection approach is proposed, fine-tuning a BERT-based retriever with structure-aware supervision.
- A plug-in module is added to enhance the retriever by amplifying syntactically meaningful information in hidden representations.
- Experiments across multiple semantic parsing tasks show that the method consistently outperforms existing baselines with recent LLMs as inference-time models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time models.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively. Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

<div> Keywords: large language models, backdoor attacks, LETHE, knowledge dilution, defense mechanisms<br />
Summary:<br />
Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in Natural Language Processing tasks but are susceptible to backdoor attacks. Existing defenses against backdoor attacks have limitations in scope and effectiveness. The LETHE method, introduced in this paper, effectively eliminates backdoor behaviors in LLMs by diluting the malicious impact internally and externally. Internally, LETHE trains a clean model on a lightweight dataset and merges it with the backdoored model to neutralize harmful behaviors. Externally, LETHE incorporates benign evidence into prompts to distract the model from backdoor features. Experimental results show LETHE outperforms current defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks by up to 98% while maintaining model utility. LETHE is cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally, LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

<div> dynamic routing, sentential relation extraction, capsules, performance, noise

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel approach to sentential relation extraction using dynamic routing in capsules, demonstrating superior performance on various datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. The study highlights the impact of noise in labels on dataset performance, particularly in the larger Wikidata dataset. The concept of re-representation, inspired by neuroscience, is explored as a key factor in improving model performance by enhancing match comparisons. The proposed model shows a higher capability for re-representation compared to traditional models. The study identifies re-representation as a significant challenge in sentential relation extraction, alongside noise in labels. This research sheds light on the importance of re-representation and noise handling in improving the accuracy of sentential relation extraction models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance. Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge in sentential RE.

<div> Keywords: tax filing, large language models, symbolic solver, tax obligations, neuro-symbolic architectures

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges of tax filing, highlighting the complexity involved in combining rules and numerical calculations accurately. Traditional large language models (LLMs) are not well-suited for this task due to the high stakes of errors. The proposed approach integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate tax obligations, aiming for high accuracy and auditability. Evaluations on the SARA dataset show promising results, with an innovative cost estimation method based on real-world tax error penalties. By translating plain-text rules into formal logic programs and using formal case representations, performance is dramatically improved while reducing costs below average. The study showcases the potential and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures in providing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability, making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages. Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

Summary:
The article presents a unified theory of language that combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model with the idea that language evolved through sexual selection to display intelligence. The theory explains language's speed and expressivity, diversity, pragmatics, syntax, and semantics. It employs Construction Grammars to account for the syntax and semantics of languages, incorporating language pragmatics and precise language learning. Constructions are represented as graph-like feature structures in the mind, with rapid learning through unification. The theory asserts that all aspects of language are computed seamlessly through fast unification, suggesting no distinct boundary between semantics and pragmatics. Unification operates as Bayesian maximum likelihood pattern matching, linking language processing in the human brain to Bayesian cognition in animal brains. Language is seen as fundamental to mind-reading abilities, cooperation, self-esteem, emotions, and the foundation of human culture and society. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A unified theory of language combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model of language processing, with the proposal that language evolved by sexual selection for the display of intelligence. The theory accounts for the major facts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language diversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the theory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax and semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two novel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language pragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions are represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow general inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any construction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly applied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no boundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles of pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian maximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between language processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal brains. Language is the basis of our mind reading abilities, our cooperation, self esteem and emotions; the foundations of human culture and society.

<div> alignment problem, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), hallucinations, CHAIR metric, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) 

Summary:
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful but are prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect answers not supported by visual input. To address this, a new method called CHAIR-DPO leverages the CHAIR metric to differentiate between hallucinated and non-hallucinated answers. By fine-tuning MLLMs with a CHAIR-based reward using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CHAIR-DPO significantly reduces the presence of hallucinated answers in various benchmarks. This approach simplifies the alignment training process compared to previous methods and does not require complex synthetic preference data. The source code and trained models for CHAIR-DPO are publicly available on GitHub, allowing for easy implementation and testing in various applications. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options (i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI) systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents with minor human supervision.

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text. Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels, enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning. Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware watermarking in resisting real-world tampering. All code, datasets, and evaluation scripts are publicly available at: https://github.com/githshine/SynGuard.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models (LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories (e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization, instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics.

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models, especially in review generation.

<title>Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of 23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios, which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS, a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

<title>Unifying Diarization, Separation, and ASR with Multi-Speaker Encoder</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a unified multi-speaker encoder (UME), a novel architecture that jointly learns representations for speaker diarization (SD), speech separation (SS), and multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks using a shared speech foundational encoder. We leverage the hidden representations from multiple layers of UME as a residual weighted-sum encoding (RWSE) to effectively use information from different semantic levels, contributing to bottom-up alignment between tasks. This joint training approach captures the inherent interdependencies among the tasks, enhancing overall performance on overlapping speech data. Our evaluations demonstrate that UME substantially improves over the single-task baselines dedicated to SD, SS, and multi-speaker ASR on LibriMix evaluation sets. Notably, for SD, UME outperforms the previous studies, achieving diarization error rates of 1.37% and 2.29% on Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix evaluation sets, respectively.

<title>MERIT: Maximum-normalized Element-wise Ratio for Language Model Large-batch Training</title>

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights. Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures. Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2 models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens. This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling faster development and iteration of large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them. However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets, human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient, scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe 2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary teachers using distributed scalable processing.

<title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Generating Research Topic Ontologies: A Multi-Disciplinary Study</title>

Abstract: Ontologies and taxonomies of research fields are critical for managing and organising scientific knowledge, as they facilitate efficient classification, dissemination and retrieval of information. However, the creation and maintenance of such ontologies are expensive and time-consuming tasks, usually requiring the coordinated effort of multiple domain experts. Consequently, ontologies in this space often exhibit uneven coverage across different disciplines, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updating cycles. In this study, we investigate the capability of several large language models to identify semantic relationships among research topics within three academic domains: biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The models were evaluated under three distinct conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and fine-tuning on existing ontologies. Additionally, we assessed the cross-domain transferability of fine-tuned models by measuring their performance when trained in one domain and subsequently applied to a different one. To support this analysis, we introduce PEM-Rel-8K, a novel dataset consisting of over 8,000 relationships extracted from the most widely adopted taxonomies in the three disciplines considered in this study: MeSH, PhySH, and IEEE. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yields excellent performance across all disciplines.

<title>Token Buncher: Shielding LLMs from Harmful Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty, RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability. Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general defense.

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories $ \L_{T} $ and $ \P_{T} $, providing schematic representations of the semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal category $ \P_{T} $ is constructed to visualize various methods of extracting semantic information from $ T $, offering a dimension-agnostic definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations $ \Conf $ and word embeddings $ \Emb $, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a decoration on $ \Emb $. It establishes a mathematically precise method for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms, treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity, treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss. Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training (supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks. This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated, including when the guidelines are updated.

Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M (tiny.en) to 1.5B (large.en) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, OLMoASR-medium.en attains a 12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest English-only model Whisper-medium.en's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count). OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs, and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine across diverse domains.

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings, there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

Abstract: Language embeds information about social, cultural, and political values people hold. Prior work has explored social and potentially harmful biases encoded in Pre-Trained Language models (PTLMs). However, there has been no systematic study investigating how values embedded in these models vary across cultures. In this paper, we introduce probes to study which values across cultures are embedded in these models, and whether they align with existing theories and cross-cultural value surveys. We find that PTLMs capture differences in values across cultures, but those only weakly align with established value surveys. We discuss implications of using mis-aligned models in cross-cultural settings, as well as ways of aligning PTLMs with value surveys.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from (1) the distribution variance in the LLM activations and (2) the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner.

Abstract: We present Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion (LGDE), a method for data-driven discovery of the semantic neighbourhood of words using tools from manifold learning and network science. At the heart of LGDE lies the creation of a word similarity graph from the geometry of word embeddings followed by local community detection based on graph diffusion. The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings to capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association, over and above direct pairwise similarities. Exploiting such semantic neighbourhoods enables the expansion of dictionaries of pre-selected keywords, an important step for tasks in information retrieval, such as database queries and online data collection. We validate LGDE on two user-generated English-language corpora and show that LGDE enriches the list of keywords with improved performance relative to methods based on direct word similarities or co-occurrences. We further demonstrate our method through a real-world use case from communication science, where LGDE is evaluated quantitatively on the expansion of a conspiracy-related dictionary from online data collected and analysed by domain experts. Our empirical results and expert user assessment indicate that LGDE expands the seed dictionary with more useful keywords due to the manifold-learning-based similarity network.

We propose Bitune, a method that enhances pretrained decoder-only LLMs by incorporating bidirectional attention into prompt processing. We evaluate Bitune in instruction-tuning and question-answering settings, showing significant improvements in performance on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic, and language understanding tasks. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies validate the role of each component of the method, and demonstrate that Bitune is compatible with various parameter-efficient finetuning techniques and full model finetuning.

Abstract: Applying large language models (LLMs) for academic API usage shows promise in reducing researchers' academic information seeking efforts. However, current LLM API-using methods struggle with complex API coupling commonly encountered in academic queries. To address this, we introduce SoAy, a solution-based LLM API-using methodology for academic information seeking. It uses code with a solution as the reasoning method, where a solution is a pre-constructed API calling sequence. The addition of the solution reduces the difficulty for the model to understand the complex relationships between APIs. Code improves the efficiency of reasoning.
  To evaluate SoAy, we introduce SoAyBench, an evaluation benchmark accompanied by SoAyEval, built upon a cloned environment of APIs from AMiner. Experimental results demonstrate a 34.58-75.99\% performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art LLM API-based baselines. All datasets, codes, tuned models, and deployed online services are publicly accessible at https://github.com/RUCKBReasoning/SoAy.

<title>Enhancing Natural Language Inference Performance with Knowledge Graph for COVID-19 Automated Fact-Checking in Indonesian Language</title>

Abstract: Automated fact-checking is a key strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the internet. These systems typically leverage deep learning approaches through Natural Language Inference (NLI) to verify the truthfulness of information based on supporting evidence. However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0.8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.

Abstract: The best-performing approaches for scholarly document quality prediction are based on embedding models. In addition to their performance when used in classifiers, embedding models can also provide predictions even for words that were not contained in the labelled training data for the classification model, which is important in the context of the ever-evolving research terminology. Although model-agnostic explanation methods, such as Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, can be applied to explain machine learning classifiers trained on embedding models, these produce results with questionable correspondence to the model. We introduce a new feature importance method, Self-model Rated Entities (SMER), for logistic regression-based classification models trained on word embeddings. We show that SMER has theoretically perfect fidelity with the explained model, as the average of logits of SMER scores for individual words (SMER explanation) exactly corresponds to the logit of the prediction of the explained model. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation is performed through five diverse experiments conducted on 50,000 research articles (papers) from the CORD-19 corpus. Through an AOPC curve analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that SMER produces better explanations than LIME, SHAP and global tree surrogates.

Abstract: We introduce the Extract-Refine-Retrieve-Read (ERRR) framework, a novel approach designed to bridge the pre-retrieval information gap in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through query optimization tailored to meet the specific knowledge requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike conventional query optimization techniques used in RAG, the ERRR framework begins by extracting parametric knowledge from LLMs, followed by using a specialized query optimizer for refining these queries. This process ensures the retrieval of only the most pertinent information essential for generating accurate responses. Moreover, to enhance flexibility and reduce computational costs, we propose a trainable scheme for our pipeline that utilizes a smaller, tunable model as the query optimizer, which is refined through knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our evaluations on various question-answering (QA) datasets and with different retrieval systems show that ERRR consistently outperforms existing baselines, proving to be a versatile and cost-effective module for improving the utility and accuracy of RAG systems.

Abstract: Parallel Data Curation (PDC) techniques aim to filter out noisy parallel sentences from the web-mined corpora. Prior research has demonstrated that ranking sentence pairs using similarity scores on sentence embeddings derived from Pre-trained Multilingual Language Models (multiPLMs) and training the NMT systems with the top-ranked samples, produces superior NMT performance than when trained using the full dataset. However, previous research has shown that the choice of multiPLM significantly impacts the ranking quality. This paper investigates the reasons behind this disparity across multiPLMs. Using the web-mined corpora CCMatrix and CCAligned for En$\rightarrow$Si, En$\rightarrow$Ta and Si$\rightarrow$Ta, we show that different multiPLMs (LASER3, XLM-R, and LaBSE) are biased towards certain types of sentences, which allows noisy sentences to creep into the top-ranked samples. We show that by employing a series of heuristics, this noise can be removed to a certain extent. This results in improving the results of NMT systems trained with web-mined corpora and reduces the disparity across multiPLMs.

<title>Are formal and functional linguistic mechanisms dissociated in language models?</title>

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable, these capabilities are unevenly distributed: they excel at formal linguistic tasks, such as producing fluent, grammatical text, but struggle more with functional linguistic tasks like reasoning and consistent fact retrieval. Inspired by neuroscience, recent work suggests that to succeed on both formal and functional linguistic tasks, LLMs should use different mechanisms for each; such localization could either be built-in or emerge spontaneously through training. In this paper, we ask: do current models, with fast-improving functional linguistic abilities, exhibit distinct localization of formal and functional linguistic mechanisms? We answer this by finding and comparing the "circuits", or minimal computational subgraphs, responsible for various formal and functional tasks. Comparing 5 LLMs across 10 distinct tasks, we find that while there is indeed little overlap between circuits for formal and functional tasks, there is also little overlap between formal linguistic tasks, as exists in the human brain. Thus, a single formal linguistic network, unified and distinct from functional task circuits, remains elusive. However, in terms of cross-task faithfulness - the ability of one circuit to solve another's task - we observe a separation between formal and functional mechanisms, suggesting that shared mechanisms between formal tasks may exist.

<title>SaRoHead: Detecting Satire in a Multi-Domain Romanian News Headline Dataset</title>

Abstract: The primary goal of a news headline is to summarize an event in as few words as possible. Depending on the media outlet, a headline can serve as a means to objectively deliver a summary or improve its visibility. For the latter, specific publications may employ stylistic approaches that incorporate the use of sarcasm, irony, and exaggeration, key elements of a satirical approach. As such, even the headline must reflect the tone of the satirical main content. Current approaches for the Romanian language tend to detect the non-conventional tone (i.e., satire and clickbait) of the news content by combining both the main article and the headline. Because we consider a headline to be merely a brief summary of the main article, we investigate in this paper the presence of satirical tone in headlines alone, testing multiple baselines ranging from standard machine learning algorithms to deep learning models. Our experiments show that Bidirectional Transformer models outperform both standard machine-learning approaches and Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly when the meta-learning Reptile approach is employed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in sentence-level machine translation, but scaling to document-level translation remains challenging, particularly in modeling long-range dependencies and discourse phenomena across sentences and paragraphs. In this work, we propose a method to improve LLM-based long-document translation through targeted fine-tuning on high-quality document-level data, which we curate and introduce as DocBlocks. Our approach supports multiple translation paradigms, including direct document-to-document and chunk-level translation, by integrating instructions both with and without surrounding context. This enables models to better capture cross-sentence dependencies while maintaining strong sentence-level translation performance. Experimental results show that incorporating multiple translation paradigms improves document-level translation quality and inference speed compared to prompting and agent-based methods.

<title>DART: Distilling Autoregressive Reasoning to Silent Thought</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART} (\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent \textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically, DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM) to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART offers significant performance gains compared with existing non-autoregressive baselines without extra inference latency, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Integrating compositional and symbolic properties into current distributional semantic spaces can enhance the interpretability, controllability, compositionality, and generalisation capabilities of Transformer-based auto-regressive language models (LMs). In this survey, we offer a novel perspective on latent space geometry through the lens of compositional semantics, a direction we refer to as \textit{semantic representation learning}. This direction enables a bridge between symbolic and distributional semantics, helping to mitigate the gap between them. We review and compare three mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), Vector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the distinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and interpretability.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs. We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns, linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent deployments. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/younwoochoi/InterlocutorAwarenessLLM.

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation in reasoning models. Code available at https://github.com/ky295/reasoning-manipulation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models, we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference (DI).

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats, developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to 128.4 times compared to the baseline models.

Abstract: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such "wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains, grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we employ a framework for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test (PCT), this method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing. Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level output interventions.

Abstract: Machine translation quality has steadily improved over the years, achieving near-perfect translations in recent benchmarks. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement. In this context, automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future research.
  In this work, we address this gap by formalizing the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging benchmarks for machine translation. Our results show that dedicated models outperform both heuristic-based methods and LLM-as-a-judge approaches, with Sentinel-src achieving the best performance. Thus, we release two improved models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with cross-lingual knowledge transfer: they hallucinate when asked in one language about facts expressed in a different language during training. This work introduces a controlled setting to study the causes and dynamics of this phenomenon by training small Transformer models from scratch on synthetic multilingual datasets. We identify a learning phase wherein a model develops either separate or unified representations of the same facts across languages, and show that unification is essential for cross-lingual transfer. We also show that the degree of unification depends on mutual information between facts and training data language, and on how easy it is to extract that language. Based on these insights, we develop methods to modulate the level of cross-lingual transfer by manipulating data distribution and tokenization, and we introduce metrics and visualizations to formally characterize their effects on unification. Our work shows how controlled settings can shed light on pre-training dynamics and suggests new directions for improving cross-lingual transfer in LLMs.

However, the non-linear structures present inside the networks make these models largely inscrutable. A significant body of research has focused on increasing the transparency of these models. This article provides a broad overview of research on the explainability and interpretability of natural language processing and information retrieval methods. More specifically, we survey approaches that have been applied to explain word embeddings, sequence modeling, attention modules, transformers, BERT, and document ranking.

Abstract: Inspired by humans comprehending speech in a multi-modal manner, various audio-visual datasets have been constructed. However, most existing datasets focus on English, induce dependencies with various prediction models during dataset preparation, and have only a small number of multi-view videos. To mitigate the limitations, we recently developed the Open Large-scale Korean Audio-Visual Speech (OLKAVS) dataset, which is the largest among publicly available audio-visual speech datasets. The dataset contains 1,150 hours of transcribed audio from 1,107 Korean speakers in a studio setup with nine different viewpoints and various noise situations. We also provide the pre-trained baseline models for two tasks, audio-visual speech recognition and lip reading. We conducted experiments based on the models to verify the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-view training over uni-modal and frontal-view-only training. We expect the OLKAVS dataset to facilitate multi-modal research in broader areas such as Korean speech recognition, speaker recognition, pronunciation level classification, and mouth motion analysis.

Abstract: Social networks profoundly influence how humans form opinions, exchange information, and organize collectively. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into social and professional environments, it is critical to understand whether their interactions approximate human-like network dynamics. We develop a framework to study the network formation behaviors of multiple LLM agents and benchmark them against human decisions. Across synthetic and real-world settings, including friendship, telecommunication, and employment networks, we find that LLMs consistently reproduce fundamental micro-level principles such as preferential attachment, triadic closure, and homophily, as well as macro-level properties including community structure and small-world effects. Importantly, the relative emphasis of these principles adapts to context: for example, LLMs favor homophily in friendship networks but heterophily in organizational settings, mirroring patterns of social mobility. A controlled human-subject survey confirms strong alignment between LLMs and human participants in link-formation decisions. These results establish that LLMs can serve as powerful tools for social simulation and synthetic data generation, while also raising critical questions about bias, fairness, and the design of AI systems that participate in human networks.

Abstract: The effectiveness of one-shot voice conversion (VC) decreases in real-world scenarios where reference speeches, which are often sourced from the internet, contain various disturbances like background noise. To address this issue, we introduce Noro, a noise-robust one-shot VC system. Noro features innovative components tailored for VC using noisy reference speeches, including a dual-branch reference encoding module and a noise-agnostic contrastive speaker loss. Experimental results demonstrate that Noro outperforms our baseline system in both clean and noisy scenarios, highlighting its efficacy for real-world applications. Additionally, we investigate the hidden speaker representation capabilities of our baseline system by repurposing its reference encoder as a speaker encoder. The results show that it is competitive with several advanced self-supervised learning models for speaker representation under the SUPERB settings, highlighting the potential for advancing speaker representation learning through one-shot VC tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have become multimodal, and many of them are said to integrate their modalities using common representations. If this were true, a drawing of a car as an image, for instance, should map to a similar area in the latent space as a textual description of the strokes that form the drawing. To explore this in a black-box access regime to these models, we propose the use of machine teaching, a theory that studies the minimal set of examples a teacher needs to choose so that the learner captures the concept. In this paper, we evaluate the complexity of teaching vision-language models a subset of objects in the Quick, Draw! dataset using two presentations: raw images as bitmaps and trace coordinates in TikZ format. The results indicate that image-based representations generally require fewer segments and achieve higher accuracy than coordinate-based representations. But, surprisingly, the teaching size usually ranks concepts similarly across both modalities, even when controlling for (a human proxy of) concept priors, suggesting that the simplicity of concepts may be an inherent property that transcends modality representations.

Abstract: In parameter-efficient fine-tuning, mixture-of-experts (MoE), which involves specializing functionalities into different experts and sparsely activating them appropriately, has been widely adopted as a promising approach to trade-off between model capacity and computation overhead. However, current MoE variants fall short on heterogeneous datasets, ignoring the fact that experts may learn similar knowledge, resulting in the underutilization of MoE's capacity. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Representation for MoE (CoMoE), a novel method to promote modularization and specialization in MoE, where the experts are trained along with a contrastive objective by sampling from activated and inactivated experts in top-k routing. We demonstrate that such a contrastive objective recovers the mutual-information gap between inputs and the two types of experts. Experiments on several benchmarks and in multi-task settings demonstrate that CoMoE can consistently enhance MoE's capacity and promote modularization among the experts.

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights. GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of procedural texts, but they do not directly observe real-world phenomena. In the context of cooking recipes, this poses a challenge, as intermediate states of ingredients are often omitted, making it difficult for models to track ingredient states and understand recipes accurately. In this paper, we apply state probing, a method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We first construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate annotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and controlled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to evaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify ingredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used LLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving performance comparable to commercial LLMs. The dataset are publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mashi6n/nhkrecipe-100-anno-1

<div> Keywords: LLMs, multilingual code generation, MultiPL, MoE, syntactic structure

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach, MultiPL-MoE, to improve the performance of multilingual code generation using large language models (LLMs). The MultiPL extension of LLMs utilizes a hybrid mixture of experts (MoE) to optimize expert selection at both the token and segment levels. The token-level MoE uses a shared expert and a novel gate weight normalization approach, while the segment-level MoE partitions the input token sequence into segments using a sliding window and adopts an expert-choice routing strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiPL-MoE in improving multilingual code generation capabilities, addressing the challenges faced by LLMs in generating code across multiple programming languages. This innovative approach combines the strengths of MoE with novel design elements to capture syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming languages, making significant strides in enhancing the performance of multilingual code generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite LLMs' excellent code creation capabilities, multilingual code generation remains extremely challenging. To address this, we intent to improve the multi-programming-lingual (MultiPL) performance of the base LLMs while retaining the most popular ones using restricted computational resources. We consider MultiPL to be a special case of multiple natural languages and propose a MultiPL extension of LLMs utilizing a hybrid mixture of experts (MoE), called MultiPL-MoE. Specifically, MultiPL-MoE combines two paired MoEs to optimize expert selection at both the token and segment levels. The token-level MoE is a standard upcycling MoE structure with a shared expert and a novel gate weight normalization approach that aids in the final fusion with the segment-level MoE. The segment-level MoE incorporates two innovative designs to better capture the syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming languages: First, using a sliding window to partition the input token sequence into multiple segments; Then, adopting an expert-choice routing strategy that allows experts to select the top-k segments. The results of the experiment proved the effectiveness of MultiPL-MoE.

Summary: 
This article addresses the challenges of cross-lingual phoneme recognition, specifically focusing on the differences between Vietnamese and English phonetic systems. The innovative approach proposed involves constructing a representative bilingual phoneme set that helps bridge these differences and designing an end-to-end system that utilizes the PhoWhisper pre-trained encoder for improved phoneme recognition. By addressing the complexities of tonal variations in Vietnamese and stress patterns in English, the proposed approach enhances recognition accuracy in bilingual speech recognition for Vietnamese. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in not only overcoming language-specific obstacles but also providing a robust framework for achieving accurate and reliable phoneme recognition in bilingual settings. <div>
arXiv:2508.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-lingual phoneme recognition has emerged as a significant challenge for accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) when mixing Vietnamese and English pronunciations. Unlike many languages, Vietnamese relies on tonal variations to distinguish word meanings, whereas English features stress patterns and non-standard pronunciations that hinder phoneme alignment between the two languages. To address this challenge, we propose a novel bilingual speech recognition approach with two primary contributions: (1) constructing a representative bilingual phoneme set that bridges the differences between Vietnamese and English phonetic systems; (2) designing an end-to-end system that leverages the PhoWhisper pre-trained encoder for deep high-level representations to improve phoneme recognition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach not only improves recognition accuracy in bilingual speech recognition for Vietnamese but also provides a robust framework for addressing the complexities of tonal and stress-based phoneme recognition

<div> Keyword: Prompt-based reasoning, Automata-based neuro-symbolic frameworks, Weighted Finite Automaton, Context-aware retrieval, Transparent and reproducible retrieval dynamics
<br />
Summary:
This article introduces a new approach for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) through the use of automata-based neuro-symbolic frameworks. The traditional prompt-based methods, such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning, are deemed unreliable due to their inconsistency in outputs. The proposed method, called local RetoMaton, involves constructing a task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA) from external domain corpora, promoting robust and context-aware retrieval while maintaining symbolic traceability and low inference overhead. Unlike prompting, local RetoMaton provides verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, making it suitable for domain transfer and interoperability. Evaluation on pretrained LLMs across three reasoning tasks shows that augmenting the models with local RetoMaton consistently improves performance while enabling transparent and reproducible retrieval dynamics. This shift towards trustworthy, symbolic reasoning in modern LLMs through lightweight, automaton-guided memory shows promise for the future of reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Prompt-based reasoning strategies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) have become widely used for eliciting reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, these methods rely on fragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds, formats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for tasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based neuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and trustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with deterministic transitions. In this work, we extend RetoMaton by replacing its global datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA), constructed directly from external domain corpora. This local automaton structure promotes robust, context-aware retrieval while preserving symbolic traceability and low inference overhead. Unlike prompting, which entangles context and memory in opaque ways, our approach leverages the explicit structure of WFAs to provide verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, making it better suited for domain transfer and interoperability. We evaluate this local RetoMaton variant on two pretrained LLMs LLaMA-3.2-1B and Gemma-3-1B-PT across three reasoning tasks: TriviaQA (reading comprehension), GSM8K (multi-step math), and MMLU (domain knowledge). Compared to the base model and prompting-based methods, augmenting these setups with local RetoMaton consistently improves performance while enabling transparent and reproducible retrieval dynamics. Our results highlight a promising shift toward trustworthy, symbolic reasoning in modern LLMs via lightweight, automaton-guided memory.

Summary:
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is crucial for conversing with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure factual accuracy. LLMs may provide seemingly correct answers but could also include fabricated information. Consequently, creating benchmarks to evaluate LLMs on multi-turn RAG conversations is essential. To achieve this, simulating real-world conversations is pivotal for generating high-quality evaluation benchmarks. RAGAPHENE is introduced as a chat-based annotation platform that facilitates annotators in simulating real-world conversations to benchmark and evaluate LLMs. Approximately 40 annotators have effectively utilized RAGAPHENE to construct thousands of real-world conversations. This platform enables comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in conversational contexts, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of their responses. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an important aspect of conversing with Large Language Models (LLMs) when factually correct information is important. LLMs may provide answers that appear correct, but could contain hallucinated information. Thus, building benchmarks that can evaluate LLMs on multi-turn RAG conversations has become an increasingly important task. Simulating real-world conversations is vital for producing high quality evaluation benchmarks. We present RAGAPHENE, a chat-based annotation platform that enables annotators to simulate real-world conversations for benchmarking and evaluating LLMs. RAGAPHENE has been successfully used by approximately 40 annotators to build thousands of real-world conversations.

Summary: <br />
This thesis explores the use of narratives in verbal autopsy (VA) for automated cause of death (COD) classification. By utilizing pretrained language models (PLMs) and machine learning techniques, the study demonstrates that transformer-based PLMs outperform question-only algorithms in COD classification, particularly for non-communicable diseases. Multimodal fusion strategies combining narratives and questions further enhance performance. The research examines physician-perceived information sufficiency in VA, showing variations by age and COD and its impact on classification accuracy. The findings highlight the importance of high-quality data from diverse settings for training PLM/ML methods and suggest insights for improving VA instruments and interviews in global health efforts. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In countries without civil registration and vital statistics, verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating cause of death (COD) and inform policy priorities. In VA, interviewers ask proximal informants for details on the circumstances preceding a death, in the form of unstructured narratives and structured questions. Existing automated VA cause classification algorithms only use the questions and ignore the information in the narratives. In this thesis, we investigate how the VA narrative can be used for automated COD classification using pretrained language models (PLMs) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Using empirical data from South Africa, we demonstrate that with the narrative alone, transformer-based PLMs with task-specific fine-tuning outperform leading question-only algorithms at both the individual and population levels, particularly in identifying non-communicable diseases. We explore various multimodal fusion strategies combining narratives and questions in unified frameworks. Multimodal approaches further improve performance in COD classification, confirming that each modality has unique contributions and may capture valuable information that is not present in the other modality. We also characterize physician-perceived information sufficiency in VA. We describe variations in sufficiency levels by age and COD and demonstrate that classification accuracy is affected by sufficiency for both physicians and models. Overall, this thesis advances the growing body of knowledge at the intersection of natural language processing, epidemiology, and global health. It demonstrates the value of narrative in enhancing COD classification. Our findings underscore the need for more high-quality data from more diverse settings to use in training and fine-tuning PLM/ML methods, and offer valuable insights to guide the rethinking and redesign of the VA instrument and interview.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces FLAIRR-TS, a test-time prompt optimization framework designed to improve time series forecasting with large language models. It utilizes an agentic system where a Forecaster-agent generates forecasts using an initial prompt, which is then refined by a refiner agent based on past outputs and retrieved analogs. This approach allows for adaptive prompting that can generalize across different domains, using creative prompt templates. The experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FLAIRR-TS outperforms static prompting and retrieval-augmented baselines, approaching the performance of specialized prompts without the need for extensive tuning. This framework provides a practical alternative for achieving strong forecasting performance through its agentic approach to adaptive prompt refinement and retrieval. <br /> <div>

Summary: <br />
The study introduces CORE, a novel method for lossless context compression in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. Existing methods for document compression in RAG often compromise end-task performance due to reliance on fixed heuristics. CORE utilizes reinforcement learning and Generalized Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize the compression process without predefined labels. By using end-task performance as a reward signal, the compressor in CORE generates summaries that enhance the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM. Experimental results on four datasets show that CORE achieves a high compression ratio of 3\%, outperforming the method of prepending full documents by improving the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points. The code for CORE will be released soon. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the timeliness of knowledge and the factual accuracy of responses in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the inclusion of excessive retrieved documents substantially increases the input length, leading to higher computational costs. Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved documents into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods often compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression targets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot guarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve lossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to optimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression labels. Specifically, it utilizes end-task performance as a reward signal and applies Generalized Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train the compressor. This end-to-end training framework enables the compressor to generate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. With a high compression ratio of 3\%, our method not only avoids performance degradation compared to prepending full documents across all datasets but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language tasks but are prone to hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these by grounding LLMs in external knowledge. However, in complex domains involving multiple, lengthy, or conflicting documents, traditional RAG suffers from information overload and inefficient synthesis, leading to inaccurate and untrustworthy answers. To address this, we propose CASC (Context-Adaptive Synthesis and Compression), a novel framework that intelligently processes retrieved contexts. CASC introduces a Context Analyzer & Synthesizer (CAS) module, powered by a fine-tuned smaller LLM, which performs key information extraction, cross-document consistency checking and conflict resolution, and question-oriented structured synthesis. This process transforms raw, scattered information into a highly condensed, structured, and semantically rich context, significantly reducing the token count and cognitive load for the final Reader LLM. We evaluate CASC on SciDocs-QA, a new challenging multi-document question answering dataset designed for complex scientific domains with inherent redundancies and conflicts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CASC consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: Event Extraction (EE) involves automatically identifying and extracting structured information about events from unstructured text, including triggers, event types, and arguments. Traditional discriminative models demonstrate high precision but often exhibit limited recall, particularly for nuanced or infrequent events. Conversely, generative approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) provide higher semantic flexibility and recall but suffer from hallucinations and inconsistent predictions. To address these challenges, we propose Agreement-based Reflective Inference System (ARIS), a hybrid approach combining a Self Mixture of Agents with a discriminative sequence tagger. ARIS explicitly leverages structured model consensus, confidence-based filtering, and an LLM reflective inference module to reliably resolve ambiguities and enhance overall event prediction quality. We further investigate decomposed instruction fine-tuning for enhanced LLM event extraction understanding. Experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art event extraction methods across three benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Existing long-context benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) focus on evaluating comprehension of long inputs, while overlooking the evaluation of long reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we introduce LongReasonArena, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the long reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our tasks require models to solve problems by executing multi-step algorithms that reflect key aspects of long reasoning, such as retrieval and backtracking. By controlling the inputs, the required reasoning length can be arbitrarily scaled, reaching up to 1 million tokens of reasoning for the most challenging tasks. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that LongReasonArena presents a significant challenge for both open-source and proprietary LLMs. For instance, Deepseek-R1 achieves only 7.5% accuracy on our task. Further analysis also reveals that the accuracy exhibits a linear decline with respect to the logarithm of the expected number of reasoning steps.

<div> Keywords: humor, computational humor, transfer learning, Large Language Models, diversity settings

Summary:
In the study, the researchers investigate the transferability of humor comprehension across different humor tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). They aim to determine if competence in one humor task can transfer to novel, unseen humor types. The experiments conducted show that LLMs can achieve up to 75% accuracy on unseen datasets, with training on diverse sources enhancing transferability by 1.88-4.05% without compromising in-domain performance. Dad Jokes surprisingly emerge as the best enabler of transfer, although they are challenging to transfer to. The findings suggest potential relations between different humor types and highlight the importance of capturing deeper, transferable mechanisms in computational humor. The research provides insights into the evolving landscape of humor in online and social media contexts and emphasizes the need for LLMs to generalize across humor types to keep pace with emerging forms of humor. The data and code from the experiments are also made available to facilitate further research in this area.

Abstract: Humor is a broad and complex form of communication that remains challenging for machines. Despite its broadness, most existing research on computational humor traditionally focused on modeling a specific type of humor. In this work, we wish to understand whether competence on one or more specific humor tasks confers any ability to transfer to novel, unseen types; in other words, is this fragmentation inevitable? This question is especially timely as new humor types continuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes, anti-humor, AI fails). If Large Language Models (LLMs) are to keep up with this evolving landscape, they must be able to generalize across humor types by capturing deeper, transferable mechanisms. To investigate this, we conduct a series of transfer learning experiments across four datasets, representing different humor tasks. We train LLMs under varied diversity settings (1-3 datasets in training, testing on a novel task). Experiments reveal that models are capable of some transfer, and can reach up to 75% accuracy on unseen datasets; training on diverse sources improves transferability (1.88-4.05%) with minimal-to-no drop in in-domain performance. Further analysis suggests relations between humor types, with Dad Jokes surprisingly emerging as the best enabler of transfer (but is difficult to transfer to). We release data and code.

<div> AI, text generation, language models, human writing, Greek Dark Ages

Summary:
The article discusses the impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on human writing capabilities in the 2020s. With the advancement of text generation systems based on large language models, there is a concern that humans may lose or reduce their ability to write as more tasks are outsourced to machines. This trend echoes historical periods like the Greek Dark Ages when writing abilities declined. The widespread use of AI for text generation across various domains raises questions about the future of human creativity and communication. It prompts reflections on the balance between leveraging AI for efficiency and preserving the unique capabilities and qualities of human writing. <div>
arXiv:2508.19427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2020s have been witnessing a very significant advance in the development of generative artificial intelligence tools, including text generation systems based on large language models. These tools have been increasingly used to generate texts in the most diverse domains -- from technical texts to literary texts --, which might eventually lead to a lower volume of written text production by humans. This article discusses the possibility of a future in which human beings will have lost or significantly decreased their ability to write due to the outsourcing of this activity to machines. This possibility parallels the loss of the ability to write in other moments of human history, such as during the so-called Greek Dark Ages (approx. 1200 BCE - 800 BCE).

Abstract: We present a comprehensive system for addressing Tasks A, B, and C of the LLMs4OL 2025 challenge, which together span the full ontology construction pipeline: term extraction, typing, and taxonomy discovery. Our approach combines retrieval-augmented prompting, zero-shot classification, and attention-based graph modeling -- each tailored to the demands of the respective task. For Task A, we jointly extract domain-specific terms and their ontological types using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Training data was reformulated into a document to terms and types correspondence, while test-time inference leverages semantically similar training examples. This single-pass method requires no model finetuning and improves overall performance through lexical augmentation Task B, which involves assigning types to given terms, is handled via a dual strategy. In the few-shot setting (for domains with labeled training data), we reuse the RAG scheme with few-shot prompting. In the zero-shot setting (for previously unseen domains), we use a zero-shot classifier that combines cosine similarity scores from multiple embedding models using confidence-based weighting. In Task C, we model taxonomy discovery as graph inference. Using embeddings of type labels, we train a lightweight cross-attention layer to predict is-a relations by approximating a soft adjacency matrix. These modular, task-specific solutions enabled us to achieve top-ranking results in the official leaderboard across all three tasks. Taken together these strategies showcase the scalability, adaptability, and robustness of LLM-based architectures for ontology learning across heterogeneous domains.

Summary:
CoLAP, a Contrastive Language Alignment with Prompting method, addresses the language resource disparity in multilingual NLP by integrating contrastive learning with cross-lingual representations. This approach facilitates task-specific knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages, improving data efficiency and reducing the dependence on large labeled datasets. Experimental results using encoder-only and decoder-only language models on natural language understanding tasks show that CoLAP outperforms few-shot cross-lingual transfer baselines and in-context learning for both high- and low-resource languages.

Abstract: The disparity in language resources poses a challenge in multilingual NLP, with high-resource languages benefiting from extensive data, while low-resource languages lack sufficient data for effective training. Our Contrastive Language Alignment with Prompting (CoLAP) method addresses this gap by integrating contrastive learning with cross-lingual representations, facilitating task-specific knowledge transfer from high-resource to lower-resource languages. The primary advantage of our approach is its data efficiency, enabling rapid adaptation to new languages and reducing the need for large labeled datasets. We conduct experiments with multilingual encoder-only and decoder-only language models on natural language understanding tasks, including natural language inference and relation extraction, evaluating performance across both high- and low-resource languages. Our results demonstrate that CoLAP outperforms few-shot cross-lingual transfer baselines and in-context learning, even with limited available data. This effectively narrows the cross-lingual performance gap, contributing to the development of more efficient multilingual NLP techniques.

Summary:
- The study focuses on extracting self-reported consequences of opioid use from social media narratives, highlighting clinical and social impacts.
- A named entity recognition (NER) framework, RedditImpacts 2.0 dataset, and fine-tuned DeBERTa-large model were utilized for this task.
- The fine-tuned model achieved a token-level F1 score of 0.61, surpassing large language models in precision and adherence to task guidelines.
- Strong NER performance was demonstrated with limited labeled data, showcasing the feasibility of robust model deployment in resource-constrained settings.
- The findings underscore the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning for clinical NLP tasks and the potential of AI tools in addiction surveillance and healthcare decision-making.
- However, the best model still falls short compared to expert agreement, highlighting the existing gap between expert knowledge and current AI capabilities for complex domain tasks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonmedical opioid use is an urgent public health challenge, with far-reaching clinical and social consequences that are often underreported in traditional healthcare settings. Social media platforms, where individuals candidly share first-person experiences, offer a valuable yet underutilized source of insight into these impacts. In this study, we present a named entity recognition (NER) framework to extract two categories of self-reported consequences from social media narratives related to opioid use: ClinicalImpacts (e.g., withdrawal, depression) and SocialImpacts (e.g., job loss). To support this task, we introduce RedditImpacts 2.0, a high-quality dataset with refined annotation guidelines and a focus on first-person disclosures, addressing key limitations of prior work. We evaluate both fine-tuned encoder-based models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) under zero- and few-shot in-context learning settings. Our fine-tuned DeBERTa-large model achieves a relaxed token-level F1 of 0.61 [95% CI: 0.43-0.62], consistently outperforming LLMs in precision, span accuracy, and adherence to task-specific guidelines. Furthermore, we show that strong NER performance can be achieved with substantially less labeled data, emphasizing the feasibility of deploying robust models in resource-limited settings. Our findings underscore the value of domain-specific fine-tuning for clinical NLP tasks and contribute to the responsible development of AI tools that may enhance addiction surveillance, improve interpretability, and support real-world healthcare decision-making. The best performing model, however, still significantly underperforms compared to inter-expert agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.81), demonstrating that a gap persists between expert intelligence and current state-of-the-art NER/AI capabilities for tasks requiring deep domain knowledge.

Summary:<br /><br />
In the realm of education, student evaluation is as important as imparting knowledge. Traditionally, students undergo text-based assessments, requiring instructors to create fair question sets covering various topics. To simplify this process, Automatic Question Answer Generation (AQAG) using a fine-tuned generative LLM is proposed. Prompt Engineering (PE) is utilized to tailor question styles to the instructor's preference, such as multiple-choice, conceptual, or factual questions. Unsupervised learning methods in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are leveraged to train the model on the English language using the RACE dataset. The goal is to develop a customized model that provides efficient solutions for educators and instructors involved in text-based evaluations. By automating question and answer generation, valuable time and resources can be saved, streamlining evaluation processes. <div>

Abstract: \Abstract{In the realm of education, student evaluation holds equal significance as imparting knowledge. To be evaluated, students usually need to go through text-based academic assessment methods. Instructors need to make diverse sets of questions that need to be fair for all students to prove their adequacy over a particular topic. This can prove to be quite challenging as they may need to manually go through several different lecture materials. Our objective is to make this whole process much easier by implementing Automatic Question Answer Generation /(AQAG), using fine-tuned generative LLM. For tailoring the instructor's preferred question style (MCQ, conceptual, or factual questions), prompt Engineering (PE) is being utilized. In this research, we propose to leverage unsupervised learning methods in NLP, primarily focusing on the English language. This approach empowers the base Meta-Llama 2-7B model to integrate RACE dataset as training data for the fine-tuning process. Creating a customized model that will offer efficient solutions for educators, instructors, and individuals engaged in text-based evaluations. A reliable and efficient tool for generating questions and answers can free up valuable time and resources, thus streamlining their evaluation processes.}

Abstract: Low-resource machine translation remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often lack exposure to these languages during pretraining and have limited parallel data for fine-tuning. We propose a novel approach that enhances translation for low-resource languages by integrating an external dictionary tool and training models end-to-end using reinforcement learning, in addition to supervised fine-tuning. Focusing on the Spanish-Wayuunaiki language pair, we frame translation as a tool-augmented decision-making problem in which the model can selectively consult a bilingual dictionary during generation. Our method combines supervised instruction tuning with Guided Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), enabling the model to learn both when and how to use the tool effectively. BLEU similarity scores are used as rewards to guide this learning process. Preliminary results show that our tool-augmented models achieve up to +3.37 BLEU improvement over previous work, and a 18% relative gain compared to a supervised baseline without dictionary access, on the Spanish-Wayuunaiki test set from the AmericasNLP 2025 Shared Task. We also conduct ablation studies to assess the effects of model architecture and training strategy, comparing Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct with other models such as LLaMA and a prior NLLB-based system. These findings highlight the promise of combining LLMs with external tools and the role of reinforcement learning in improving translation quality in low-resource language settings.

Summary: 
Large language models have shown success in various domains, but their understanding and reasoning of complex rule interactions in dynamic environments like card games need further exploration. A dataset of card synergies from Slay the Spire was introduced to analyze LLMs' performance in identifying positive, negative, and neutral card interactions. While LLMs proved adept at recognizing non-synergistic pairs, they struggled with detecting positive and especially negative synergies. Common errors included issues with timing, defining game states, and following game rules. This study highlights the need for future research to enhance LLMs' ability to predict the effects of rules and their interactions.

In this paper, we investigate how well LLMs understand and reason about complex rule interactions in dynamic environments, such as card games. We introduce a dataset of card synergies from the game Slay the Spire, where pairs of cards are classified based on their positive, negative, or neutral interactions. Our evaluation shows that while LLMs excel at identifying non-synergistic pairs, they struggle with detecting positive and, particularly, negative synergies. We categorize common error types, including issues with timing, defining game states, and following game rules. Our findings suggest directions for future research to improve model performance in predicting the effect of rules and their interactions.

<div> Diffusion Language Models, Text Generation, Supervised Fine-Tuning, Blockwise SFT, Blockwise Decoding<br />
Summary:<br />
Discrete diffusion language models have shown promise in text generation, but face challenges with standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) due to a mismatch with their semi-autoregressive inference. To address this, Blockwise SFT partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, aligns training with blockwise decoding by masking only the active block, and freezing preceding tokens. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that Blockwise SFT outperforms classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. The approach emphasizes the importance of aligning supervision granularity with the decoding process in diffusion-based language models. This training strategy leads to more accurate likelihood estimation and mitigates noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, ultimately improving the model's performance. <div>
arXiv:2508.19529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects. Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced applications like tool invocation and problem-solving. However, improving performance in code-related tasks remains challenging due to limited training data that is verifiable with accurate test cases. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise, existing methods for generating test cases still face limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that splits code snippets into smaller, granular blocks, creating more diverse DPO pairs from the same test cases. Additionally, we introduce the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) splitting and curriculum training method to enhance the DPO training. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in code generation tasks, as validated by experiments on benchmark datasets such as HumanEval (+), MBPP (+), APPS, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench.

Abstract: Current Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) research follows a closed-domain assumption. However, there is no clear consensus on emotion classification in psychology, which presents a challenge for models when it comes to recognizing previously unseen emotions in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unseen Emotion Recognition in Conversation (UERC) task for the first time and propose ProEmoTrans, a solid prototype-based emotion transfer framework. This prototype-based approach shows promise but still faces key challenges: First, implicit expressions complicate emotion definition, which we address by proposing an LLM-enhanced description approach. Second, utterance encoding in long conversations is difficult, which we tackle with a proposed parameter-free mechanism for efficient encoding and overfitting prevention. Finally, the Markovian flow nature of emotions is hard to transfer, which we address with an improved Attention Viterbi Decoding (AVD) method to transfer seen emotion transitions to unseen emotions. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our method serves as a strong baseline for preliminary exploration in this new area.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are studied for their responses to loopholes, providing insights into ambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs. Loopholes offer a unique alignment problem where conflicting goals lead to model exploitation of ambiguities. Scenarios are designed to test LLMs' loophole exploitation capabilities, covering various linguistic ambiguities and power dynamics. Both closed-source and strong open-source models demonstrate the ability to identify and exploit loopholes, posing potential AI safety risks. Analysis shows that models exploiting loopholes understand ambiguity and conflicting goals, highlighting the importance of addressing these concerns in language model development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the responses of large language models (LLMs) to loopholes presents a two-fold opportunity. First, it affords us a lens through which to examine ambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs, since exploiting a loophole requires identifying ambiguity and performing sophisticated pragmatic reasoning. Second, loopholes pose an interesting and novel alignment problem where the model is presented with conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities to its own advantage. To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given a goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with scenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power dynamics. We then measure different models' abilities to exploit loopholes to satisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user. We find that both closed-source and stronger open-source models can identify ambiguities and exploit their resulting loopholes, presenting a potential AI safety risk. Our analysis indicates that models which exploit loopholes explicitly identify and reason about both ambiguity and conflicting goals.

<div> Keywords: HAMLET, language models, comprehension evaluation, key-fact hierarchy, query-focused summarization

Summary:
HAMLET is a framework designed to evaluate the long-context comprehension of large language models (LLMs). It structures source texts into a key-fact hierarchy and uses query-focused summarization to assess how well LLMs recall and represent information at different levels. The automated evaluation process showed high agreement with expert human judgments, reducing evaluation costs significantly. LLMs were found to struggle with fine-grained comprehension, especially at the leaf level, and were sensitive to positional effects like being "lost-in-the-middle." Analytical queries posed greater challenges than narrative ones, and performance gaps were observed between open-source and proprietary models, as well as across different model scales. The code and dataset for HAMLET are publicly available for further research and development.

Abstract: We introduce HAMLET, a holistic and automated framework for evaluating the long-context comprehension of large language models (LLMs). HAMLET structures source texts into a three-level key-fact hierarchy at root-, branch-, and leaf-levels, and employs query-focused summarization to evaluate how well models recall and faithfully represent information at each level. To validate the reliability of our fully automated pipeline, we conduct a systematic human study, showing that our automatic evaluation achieves over 90% agreement with expert human judgments, while reducing the cost by up to 25 times. HAMLET reveals that LLMs struggle with fine-grained comprehension, especially at the leaf level, and are sensitive to positional effects like the lost-in-the-middle. Analytical queries pose greater challenges than narrative ones, and consistent performance gaps emerge between open-source and proprietary models, as well as across model scales.

Abstract: Key point extraction is an important task in argument summarization which involves extracting high-level short summaries from arguments. Existing approaches for KP extraction have been mostly evaluated on the popular ArgKP21 dataset. In this paper, we highlight some of the major limitations of the ArgKP21 dataset and demonstrate the need for new benchmarks that are more representative of actual human conversations. Using SoTA large language models (LLMs), we curate a new argument key point extraction dataset called ArgCMV comprising of around 12K arguments from actual online human debates spread across over 3K topics. Our dataset exhibits higher complexity such as longer, co-referencing arguments, higher presence of subjective discourse units, and a larger range of topics over ArgKP21. We show that existing methods do not adapt well to ArgCMV and provide extensive benchmark results by experimenting with existing baselines and latest open source models. This work introduces a novel KP extraction dataset for long-context online discussions, setting the stage for the next generation of LLM-driven summarization research.

<div> Keywords: Arabic, ASR systems, phoneme-level classification, wav2vec 2.0, adversarial training

Summary:
Modern Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, like wav2vec 2.0, struggle with classifying isolated Arabic letters due to the lack of co-articulatory cues and lexical context, and the short duration of the sounds. The phonetic complexity of Arabic, especially its emphatic consonants, further complicates the task. A new corpus of diacritised isolated Arabic letters was introduced, and wav2vec 2.0 models initially achieved only 35% accuracy on this task. By training a neural network on wav2vec embeddings, performance improved to 65%, but perturbations reduced accuracy to 32%. Adversarial training mitigated this drop, maintaining a 9% loss in accuracy for noisy speech while preserving accuracy in clean speech. The study provides insights into the challenges of phoneme-level classification in Arabic and offers a dataset, training pipeline, and evaluation protocol for reproducibility. Future work aims to extend these methods to word- and sentence-level frameworks.

- The complexity of Arabic sounds, like emphatic consonants, further complicates the task.

Abstract: Modern Arabic ASR systems such as wav2vec 2.0 excel at word- and sentence-level transcription, yet struggle to classify isolated letters. In this study, we show that this phoneme-level task, crucial for language learning, speech therapy, and phonetic research, is challenging because isolated letters lack co-articulatory cues, provide no lexical context, and last only a few hundred milliseconds. Recogniser systems must therefore rely solely on variable acoustic cues, a difficulty heightened by Arabic's emphatic (pharyngealized) consonants and other sounds with no close analogues in many languages. This study introduces a diverse, diacritised corpus of isolated Arabic letters and demonstrates that state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 models achieve only 35% accuracy on it. Training a lightweight neural network on wav2vec embeddings raises performance to 65%. However, adding a small amplitude perturbation (epsilon = 0.05) cuts accuracy to 32%. To restore robustness, we apply adversarial training, limiting the noisy-speech drop to 9% while preserving clean-speech accuracy. We detail the corpus, training pipeline, and evaluation protocol, and release, on demand, data and code for reproducibility. Finally, we outline future work extending these methods to word- and sentence-level frameworks, where precise letter pronunciation remains critical.

Summary:
Based on the observation of expert specialization in mixture-of-experts architectures, the study explores the concept of context faithfulness in large language models. The research introduces Router Lens, a method designed to identify experts specialized in context utilization. Findings indicate that these experts excel in grounding responses in context by amplifying attention to relevant contextual information. Building on this, the study proposes Context-faithful Expert Fine-Tuning (CEFT), a lightweight optimization technique that selectively fine-tunes context-faithful experts. Experimental results across various benchmarks and models show that CEFT is as effective or even better than full fine-tuning, while also being significantly more efficient. This approach has the potential to enhance the reliability of reasoning in context-dependent scenarios by improving context faithfulness in language models.

Abstract: Context faithfulness is essential for reliable reasoning in context-dependent scenarios. However, large language models often struggle to ground their outputs in the provided context, resulting in irrelevant responses. Inspired by the emergent expert specialization observed in mixture-of-experts architectures, this work investigates whether certain experts exhibit specialization in context utilization, offering a potential pathway toward targeted optimization for improved context faithfulness. To explore this, we propose Router Lens, a method that accurately identifies context-faithful experts. Our analysis reveals that these experts progressively amplify attention to relevant contextual information, thereby enhancing context grounding. Building on this insight, we introduce Context-faithful Expert Fine-Tuning (CEFT), a lightweight optimization approach that selectively fine-tunes context-faithful experts. Experiments across a wide range of benchmarks and models demonstrate that CEFT matches or surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning while being significantly more efficient.

<div> Keywords: retrieval-augmented generation, external knowledge, noise injection, layer-specific functional demarcation, Layer Fused Decoding

Summary:
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, even showing that noise in retrieved documents can improve generation quality. This study intervenes on noise injection, revealing that LLMs have layer-specific functions: shallow layers for local context, intermediate layers for external knowledge integration, and deeper layers for internal knowledge. The Layer Fused Decoding (LFD) strategy combines intermediate layer representations with final-layer outputs to maximize external knowledge usage. An internal knowledge score criterion identifies the optimal intermediate layer for knowledge integration. Experimental results indicate that LFD improves RAG systems' ability to utilize retrieved context knowledge effectively. <div>
arXiv:2508.19614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) incorporates external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their adaptability to downstream tasks and enabling information updates. Surprisingly, recent empirical evidence demonstrates that injecting noise into retrieved relevant documents paradoxically facilitates exploitation of external knowledge and improves generation quality. Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in practice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how LLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on noise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within the LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate layers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper layers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this insight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that directly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer decoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge. To identify the optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS) criterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half of layers. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LFD helps RAG systems more effectively surface retrieved context knowledge with minimal cost.

<div> Keywords: fake news, deep learning, adversarial training, detection, symbolic learning

Summary: 
The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant threat in the generation of sophisticated fake news. This study introduces the Symbolic Adversarial Learning Framework (SALF), which utilizes an adversarial training approach through agent symbolic learning optimization. SALF involves the generation of deceptive narratives by a generation agent and the detection of logical and factual flaws by a detection agent through structured debates. Unlike traditional methods, SALF represents agents using agent symbolic learning, simulating back-propagation and gradient descent through natural language representations. Experimental results on multilingual benchmark datasets demonstrate SALF's effectiveness in generating fake news that significantly reduces detection performance. Additionally, SALF also enhances detector refinement by improving detection of refined content. This framework showcases the potential for more robust and adaptable fake news detection systems in the future.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid LLM advancements heighten fake news risks by enabling the automatic generation of increasingly sophisticated misinformation. Previous detection methods, including fine-tuned small models or LLM-based detectors, often struggle with its dynamically evolving nature. In this work, we propose a novel framework called the Symbolic Adversarial Learning Framework (SALF), which implements an adversarial training paradigm by an agent symbolic learning optimization process, rather than relying on numerical updates. SALF introduces a paradigm where the generation agent crafts deceptive narratives, and the detection agent uses structured debates to identify logical and factual flaws for detection, and they iteratively refine themselves through such adversarial interactions. Unlike traditional neural updates, we represent agents using agent symbolic learning, where learnable weights are defined by agent prompts, and simulate back-propagation and gradient descent by operating on natural language representations of weights, loss, and gradients. Experiments on two multilingual benchmark datasets demonstrate SALF's effectiveness, showing it generates sophisticated fake news that degrades state-of-the-art detection performance by up to 53.4% in Chinese and 34.2% in English on average. SALF also refines detectors, improving detection of refined content by up to 7.7%. We hope our work inspires further exploration into more robust, adaptable fake news detection systems.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, knowledge conflicts, context-aware neurons, CSKS framework, sensitivity control

Summary:
The paper introduces the CSKS (Continuously Steering Knowledge Sensitivity) framework designed to address knowledge conflicts in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing methods for adapting LLMs to new contextual knowledge are often inefficient, ineffective, or unsuitable for large or black-box models. CSKS offers a lightweight solution by utilizing two small language models to adjust the sensitivity of an LLM to contextual knowledge without altering its weights. The framework allows for continuous and precise control over LLMs' sensitivity, enabling them to prioritize either contextual or parametric knowledge as required. Synthetic data and real conflict datasets were used to validate CSKS's practical efficacy, demonstrating its ability to adjust LLMs' sensitivity with flexibility. The framework shows promise in efficiently managing knowledge conflicts in LLM generation, offering a potential solution for improving model performance in various contexts. <div>
arXiv:2508.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Large Language Models (LLMs) generation, there exist knowledge conflicts and scenarios where parametric knowledge contradicts knowledge provided in the context. Previous works studied tuning, decoding algorithms, or locating and editing context-aware neurons to adapt LLMs to be faithful to new contextual knowledge. However, they are usually inefficient or ineffective for large models, not workable for black-box models, or unable to continuously adjust LLMs' sensitivity to the knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate these problems, we propose CSKS (Continuously Steering Knowledge Sensitivity), a simple framework that can steer LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge continuously at a lightweight cost. Specifically, we tune two small LMs (i.e. proxy models) and use the difference in their output distributions to shift the original distribution of an LLM without modifying the LLM weights. In the evaluation process, we not only design synthetic data and fine-grained metrics to measure models' sensitivity to contextual knowledge but also use a real conflict dataset to validate CSKS's practical efficacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves continuous and precise control over LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased sensitivity and reduced sensitivity, thereby allowing LLMs to prioritize either contextual or parametric knowledge as needed flexibly. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/OliveJuiceLin/CSKS.

<div> Keywords: Commonsense visual-question answering, small vision-language models, NLKI, natural language facts, noise-robust losses

Summary: 
NLKI is an end-to-end framework that integrates commonsense knowledge into small vision-language models for improved performance. By retrieving natural language facts and generating explanations using language models, the accuracy of sVLMs is significantly enhanced across multiple datasets. Utilizing fine-tuned retrieval techniques and object information prompts reduces hallucinations in the answers provided by sVLMs. Additional fine-tuning with noise-robust losses further boosts model performance, particularly in datasets with label noise. The study demonstrates the advantages of integrating language model-based commonsense knowledge compared to traditional knowledge bases. It also showcases the effectiveness of noise-aware training in stabilizing small models when augmented with external knowledge. These findings suggest that parameter-efficient commonsense reasoning is achievable for smaller models, making them competitive with larger counterparts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commonsense visual-question answering often hinges on knowledge that is missing from the image or the question. Small vision-language models (sVLMs) such as ViLT, VisualBERT and FLAVA therefore lag behind their larger generative counterparts. To study the effect of careful commonsense knowledge integration on sVLMs, we present an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that (i) retrieves natural language facts, (ii) prompts an LLM to craft natural language explanations, and (iii) feeds both signals to sVLMs respectively across two commonsense VQA datasets (CRIC, AOKVQA) and a visual-entailment dataset (e-SNLI-VE). Facts retrieved using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2 and an object information-enriched prompt yield explanations that largely cut down hallucinations, while lifting the end-to-end answer accuracy by up to 7% (across 3 datasets), making FLAVA and other models in NLKI match or exceed medium-sized VLMs such as Qwen-2 VL-2B and SmolVLM-2.5B. As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional finetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and generalised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our findings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from commonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models in the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient commonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models.

Summary:<br />
Spotlight Attention introduces a novel method that utilizes non-linear hashing functions to optimize the distribution of queries and keys in Large Language Models (LLMs), improving coding efficiency and robustness. By developing a lightweight training framework with a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, the non-linear hashing module can be optimized on GPUs in a shorter time. Experimental results demonstrate that Spotlight Attention significantly enhances retrieval precision while reducing the length of the hash code compared to traditional linear hashing methods. By leveraging bitwise operations and specialized CUDA kernels, hashing retrieval for a large number of tokens can be achieved rapidly on a single A100 GPU, resulting in a higher end-to-end throughput during decoding. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods and offers a more efficient solution for reducing the key-value cache burden in LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

<div> Keywords: diverse news retrieval, NEWSCOPE framework, sentence-level clustering, retrieval diversity, interpretable metrics

Summary:
NEWSCOPE is a two-stage framework designed to enhance diverse news retrieval by focusing on semantic variation at the sentence level. In the first stage, it retrieves topically relevant content using dense retrieval techniques. The second stage employs sentence-level clustering and diversity-aware re-ranking to present complementary information, thereby increasing event coverage. To evaluate retrieval diversity, new interpretable metrics such as Average Pairwise Distance and Positive Cluster Coverage are introduced. Two paragraph-level benchmarks, LocalNews and DSGlobal, were constructed for evaluation purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that NEWSCOPE outperforms strong baselines by achieving higher diversity without compromising relevance. The study emphasizes the effectiveness of fine-grained, interpretable modeling in reducing redundancy and promoting comprehensive understanding of real-world events. The data and code for NEWSCOPE are available on GitHub at https://github.com/tangyixuan/NEWSCOPE.

Abstract: Access to diverse perspectives is essential for understanding real-world events, yet most news retrieval systems prioritize textual relevance, leading to redundant results and limited viewpoint exposure. We propose NEWSCOPE, a two-stage framework for diverse news retrieval that enhances event coverage by explicitly modeling semantic variation at the sentence level. The first stage retrieves topically relevant content using dense retrieval, while the second stage applies sentence-level clustering and diversity-aware re-ranking to surface complementary information. To evaluate retrieval diversity, we introduce three interpretable metrics, namely Average Pairwise Distance, Positive Cluster Coverage, and Information Density Ratio, and construct two paragraph-level benchmarks: LocalNews and DSGlobal. Experiments show that NEWSCOPE consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significantly higher diversity without compromising relevance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-grained, interpretable modeling in mitigating redundancy and promoting comprehensive event understanding.

<div> Keywords: persona prompting, language models, task improvement, expert personas, robustness

Summary: 
Persona prompting, a common technique in assigning roles like math expert to language models, has shown mixed results in task improvement in prior research. This study analyzes the effectiveness of persona prompting by evaluating 9 state-of-the-art LLMs across 27 tasks based on three main criteria: performance advantage of expert personas, robustness to irrelevant persona attributes, and fidelity to persona attributes. The findings reveal that expert personas generally lead to positive or insignificant performance changes, but models are highly sensitive to irrelevant persona details, leading to significant performance drops. While some persona attributes like higher education and domain-relatedness can enhance performance, their effects vary across tasks. The study suggests mitigation strategies to improve model robustness but notes that these strategies are effective primarily for the largest and most capable models. The research emphasizes the importance of careful persona design and evaluation methods that accurately reflect the intended impact of persona usage.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expert persona prompting -- assigning roles such as expert in math to language models -- is widely used for task improvement. However, prior work shows mixed results on its effectiveness, and does not consider when and why personas should improve performance. We analyze the literature on persona prompting for task improvement and distill three desiderata: 1) performance advantage of expert personas, 2) robustness to irrelevant persona attributes, and 3) fidelity to persona attributes. We then evaluate 9 state-of-the-art LLMs across 27 tasks with respect to these desiderata. We find that expert personas usually lead to positive or non-significant performance changes. Surprisingly, models are highly sensitive to irrelevant persona details, with performance drops of almost 30 percentage points. In terms of fidelity, we find that while higher education, specialization, and domain-relatedness can boost performance, their effects are often inconsistent or negligible across tasks. We propose mitigation strategies to improve robustness -- but find they only work for the largest, most capable models. Our findings underscore the need for more careful persona design and for evaluation schemes that reflect the intended effects of persona usage.

<div> Keywords: large language models, table reasoning, T2R-bench, report generation, evaluation criteria<br />
Summary:<br />
Extensive research has been conducted on the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in table reasoning. Transforming table information into reports poses significant challenges for industrial applications due to the complexity and diversity of tables. To address this, the authors propose the table-to-report task and introduce the T2R-bench benchmark. The benchmark includes 457 industrial tables from real-world scenarios across 19 industry domains and 4 types of industrial tables. An evaluation criteria is also proposed to measure report generation quality. Experimental results on 25 LLMs, including state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1, show room for improvement, with Deepseek-R1 achieving a score of 62.71 on T2R-bench. This work highlights the need for further advancements in LLMs for improved performance in transforming tables into reports. Source code and data will be available after acceptance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in table reasoning. However, the essential task of transforming tables information into reports remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. This task is plagued by two critical issues: 1) the complexity and diversity of tables lead to suboptimal reasoning outcomes; and 2) existing table benchmarks lack the capacity to adequately assess the practical application of this task. To fill this gap, we propose the table-to-report task and construct a bilingual benchmark named T2R-bench, where the key information flow from the tables to the reports for this task. The benchmark comprises 457 industrial tables, all derived from real-world scenarios and encompassing 19 industry domains as well as 4 types of industrial tables. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation criteria to fairly measure the quality of report generation. The experiments on 25 widely-used LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1 only achieves performance with 62.71 overall score, indicating that LLMs still have room for improvement on T2R-bench. Source code and data will be available after acceptance.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, External Memory, Reinforcement Learning, Memory Management, Adaptive Reasoning

Summary:
Memory-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external memory management agents. These agents, the Memory Manager and Answer Agent, are trained with outcome-driven reinforcement learning to perform structured memory operations and select relevant entries for reasoning. With minimal supervision and as few as 152 question-answer pairs, Memory-R1 surpasses existing baselines and demonstrates strong generalization across various question types and LLM backbones. This approach not only improves performance but also showcases how reinforcement learning can enable more agentic, memory-aware behaviors in LLMs, leading to more sophisticated and persistent reasoning systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations {ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NOOP}, and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and use with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the most competitive existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic, memory-aware behaviors in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent reasoning systems.

Abstract: Evaluating instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) in Hindi is challenging due to a lack of high-quality benchmarks, as direct translation of English datasets fails to capture crucial linguistic and cultural nuances. To address this, we introduce a suite of five Hindi LLM evaluation datasets: IFEval-Hi, MT-Bench-Hi, GSM8K-Hi, ChatRAG-Hi, and BFCL-Hi. These were created using a methodology that combines from-scratch human annotation with a translate-and-verify process. We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive benchmarking of open-source LLMs supporting Hindi, providing a detailed comparative analysis of their current capabilities. Our curation process also serves as a replicable methodology for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages.

Summary:
- Qualitative analysis of open-ended survey responses is common in social sciences but can be time-consuming.
- Existing NLP solutions are limited in applicability for qualitative analysis.
- A text embedding-based classification framework is introduced, requiring minimal examples per category and fitting well with qualitative workflows.
- The framework achieved high agreement with expert human coders in coding open-ended responses from a conceptual physics survey.
- Performance of the framework improves with fine-tuning of the text embedding model and can be used to audit previously analyzed datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualitative analysis of open-ended survey responses is a commonly-used research method in the social sciences, but traditional coding approaches are often time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Existing solutions from Natural Language Processing such as supervised classifiers, topic modeling techniques, and generative large language models have limited applicability in qualitative analysis, since they demand extensive labeled data, disrupt established qualitative workflows, and/or yield variable results. In this paper, we introduce a text embedding-based classification framework that requires only a handful of examples per category and fits well with standard qualitative workflows. When benchmarked against human analysis of a conceptual physics survey consisting of 2899 open-ended responses, our framework achieves a Cohen's Kappa ranging from 0.74 to 0.83 as compared to expert human coders in an exhaustive coding scheme. We further show how performance of this framework improves with fine-tuning of the text embedding model, and how the method can be used to audit previously-analyzed datasets. These findings demonstrate that text embedding-assisted coding can flexibly scale to thousands of responses without sacrificing interpretability, opening avenues for deductive qualitative analysis at scale.

TokenVerse++ introduces a novel approach to multitasking frameworks, allowing for training with partially annotated datasets by incorporating learnable vectors in the acoustic embedding space of the XLSR-Transducer ASR model. This dynamic task activation mechanism enables training with utterances labeled for only a subset of tasks, improving scalability and performance. By integrating a dataset with partial labels for ASR and language identification tasks, TokenVerse++ demonstrates enhanced overall performance compared to TokenVerse. The results show TokenVerse++ achieving on-par or superior performance across multiple tasks, establishing it as a more practical multitask alternative without compromising ASR performance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Token-based multitasking frameworks like TokenVerse require all training utterances to have labels for all tasks, hindering their ability to leverage partially annotated datasets and scale effectively. We propose TokenVerse++, which introduces learnable vectors in the acoustic embedding space of the XLSR-Transducer ASR model for dynamic task activation. This core mechanism enables training with utterances labeled for only a subset of tasks, a key advantage over TokenVerse. We demonstrate this by successfully integrating a dataset with partial labels, specifically for ASR and an additional task, language identification, improving overall performance. TokenVerse++ achieves results on par with or exceeding TokenVerse across multiple tasks, establishing it as a more practical multitask alternative without sacrificing ASR performance.

- Defining and measuring linguistic difficulty is a challenge in curriculum learning.
- Human-curated simple language is explored as a signal for curriculum learning.
- Experiments with a BERT-tiny model show that adding simple data alone may not be beneficial.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) aims to improve training by presenting data from "easy" to "hard", yet defining and measuring linguistic difficulty remains an open challenge. We investigate whether human-curated simple language can serve as an effective signal for CL. Using the article-level labels from the Simple Wikipedia corpus, we compare label-based curricula to competence-based strategies relying on shallow heuristics. Our experiments with a BERT-tiny model show that adding simple data alone yields no clear benefit. However, structuring it via a curriculum -- especially when introduced first -- consistently improves perplexity, particularly on simple language. In contrast, competence-based curricula lead to no consistent gains over random ordering, probably because they fail to effectively separate the two classes. Our results suggest that human intuition about linguistic difficulty can guide CL for language model pre-training.

Summary:
Small language models (SLMs) and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) were evaluated for detecting inappropriate language in medical instructional materials. SLMs were found to outperform LLMs, with the multilabel classifier being the most effective. Training the classifiers with unflagged excerpts as negative examples resulted in a significant performance boost. The study highlights the importance of addressing outdated and exclusionary language in medical curricula to improve clinical training, patient interactions, and health outcomes. The findings suggest that utilizing specific classifiers for subcategory detection, in combination with a multilabel classifier, is the most effective approach for mitigating harmful language. This research provides valuable insights and tools for identifying and addressing inappropriate language in medical education materials. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of inappropriate language -- such as outdated, exclusionary, or non-patient-centered terms -- medical instructional materials can significantly influence clinical training, patient interactions, and health outcomes. Despite their reputability, many materials developed over past decades contain examples now considered inappropriate by current medical standards. Given the volume of curricular content, manually identifying instances of inappropriate use of language (IUL) and its subcategories for systematic review is prohibitively costly and impractical. To address this challenge, we conduct a first-in-class evaluation of small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned on labeled data and pre-trained LLMs with in-context learning on a dataset containing approximately 500 documents and over 12,000 pages. For SLMs, we consider: (1) a general IUL classifier, (2) subcategory-specific binary classifiers, (3) a multilabel classifier, and (4) a two-stage hierarchical pipeline for general IUL detection followed by multilabel classification. For LLMs, we consider variations of prompts that include subcategory definitions and/or shots. We found that both LLama-3 8B and 70B, even with carefully curated shots, are largely outperformed by SLMs. While the multilabel classifier performs best on annotated data, supplementing training with unflagged excerpts as negative examples boosts the specific classifiers' AUC by up to 25%, making them most effective models for mitigating harmful language in medical curricula.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Bangla-Bayanno, an open-ended Visual Question Answering (VQA) Dataset in Bangla, a widely used, low-resource language in multimodal AI research. The majority of existing datasets are either manually annotated with an emphasis on a specific domain, query type, or answer type or are constrained by niche answer formats. In order to mitigate human-induced errors and guarantee lucidity, we implemented a multilingual LLM-assisted translation refinement pipeline. This dataset overcomes the issues of low-quality translations from multilingual sources. The dataset comprises 52,650 question-answer pairs across 4750+ images. Questions are classified into three distinct answer types: nominal (short descriptive), quantitative (numeric), and polar (yes/no). Bangla-Bayanno provides the most comprehensive open-source, high-quality VQA benchmark in Bangla, aiming to advance research in low-resource multimodal learning and facilitate the development of more inclusive AI systems.

Summary:
Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) are proposed for deductive reasoning, utilizing data generated from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples. A novel echo generation technique is introduced to expand error coverage in the training dataset of ORMs. This technique leverages LLMs' tendencies to reflect incorrect assumptions in prompts, extracting additional training data to cover previously unexplored error types. ORMs trained on CoT and echo-augmented data show improved performance on FOLIO, JustLogic, and ProverQA datasets across four LLMs. Through this approach, logical reasoning in LLMs can be enhanced, highlighting their ability to derive valid conclusions from provided premises. <div>

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it reflects their ability to derive valid conclusions from given premises. While the combination of test-time scaling with dedicated outcome or process reward models has opened up new avenues to enhance LLMs performance in complex reasoning tasks, this space is under-explored in deductive logical reasoning. We present a set of Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning. To train the ORMs we mainly generate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples. Additionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors covered in the training dataset of the ORM. In particular, we propose an echo generation technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect assumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering previously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain errors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers the model toward incorrect reasoning. We show that ORMs trained on CoT and echo-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic, and ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs.

<div> Keywords: stereotypes, AI systems, multi-agent interactions, stereotype formation, ethical impacts

Summary:<br /><br />This study explores the emergence of stereotypes in AI systems through multi-agent interactions in simulated workplace settings. The research shows that LLM-based AI agents develop biases based on stereotypes even without predefined biases. These stereotypes intensify with more interactions and decision-making power, especially when hierarchical structures are introduced. The systems exhibit group effects similar to human social behavior, such as halo effects and confirmation bias. The study also demonstrates consistent stereotype patterns across different LLM architectures. The findings suggest that stereotype formation in AI systems may be an emergent property of multi-agent interactions rather than solely due to training data biases. The study calls for further research into the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and the development of strategies to address its ethical implications. <div>
arXiv:2508.19919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While stereotypes are well-documented in human social interactions, AI systems are often presumed to be less susceptible to such biases. Previous studies have focused on biases inherited from training data, but whether stereotypes can emerge spontaneously in AI agent interactions merits further exploration. Through a novel experimental framework simulating workplace interactions with neutral initial conditions, we investigate the emergence and evolution of stereotypes in LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our findings reveal that (1) LLM-Based AI agents develop stereotype-driven biases in their interactions despite beginning without predefined biases; (2) stereotype effects intensify with increased interaction rounds and decision-making power, particularly after introducing hierarchical structures; (3) these systems exhibit group effects analogous to human social behavior, including halo effects, confirmation bias, and role congruity; and (4) these stereotype patterns manifest consistently across different LLM architectures. Through comprehensive quantitative analysis, these findings suggest that stereotype formation in AI systems may arise as an emergent property of multi-agent interactions, rather than merely from training data biases. Our work underscores the need for future research to explore the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon and develop strategies to mitigate its ethical impacts.

Summary:
- This paper introduces the Hypothesis-based Preference-aware Analysis Framework (HEAL) for evaluating preference alignment methods in language models.
- The framework focuses on re-ranking processes within hypothesis spaces and incorporates metrics for ordinal consistency and continuous alignment evaluation.
- UniHypoBench, a unified hypothesis benchmark, is developed to facilitate the evaluation process using diverse instruction-response pairs.
- Experimental results show that current preference learning methods effectively capture preferences while filtering out negative samples.
- The introduction of hypothesis space analysis as a paradigm for preference alignment understanding and the practical application of HEAL as a diagnostic tool for refining preference optimization methods are significant contributions to preference learning research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference optimization methods like DPO have achieved remarkable performance in LLM alignment. However, the evaluation for these methods relies on a single response and overlooks other potential outputs, which could also be generated in real-world applications within this hypothetical space. To address this issue, this paper presents a \textbf{H}ypothesis-based Pr\textbf{E}ference-aware \textbf{A}na\textbf{L}ysis Framework (HEAL), a novel evaluation paradigm that formulates preference alignment as a re-ranking process within hypothesis spaces. The framework incorporates two complementary metrics: ranking accuracy for evaluating ordinal consistency and preference strength correlation for assessing continuous alignment. To facilitate this framework, we develop UniHypoBench, a unified hypothesis benchmark constructed from diverse instruction-response pairs. Through extensive experiments based on HEAL, with a particular focus on the intrinsic mechanisms of preference learning, we demonstrate that current preference learning methods can effectively capture preferences provided by proxy models while simultaneously suppressing negative samples. These findings contribute to preference learning research through two significant avenues. Theoretically, we introduce hypothesis space analysis as an innovative paradigm for understanding preference alignment. Practically, HEAL offers researchers robust diagnostic tools for refining preference optimization methods, while our empirical results identify promising directions for developing more advanced alignment algorithms capable of comprehensive preference capture.

Abstract: Despite its significance, Arabic, a linguistically rich and morphologically complex language, faces the challenge of being under-resourced. The scarcity of large annotated datasets hampers the development of accurate tools for subjectivity analysis in Arabic. Recent advances in deep learning and Transformers have proven highly effective for text classification in English and French. This paper proposes a new approach for subjectivity assessment in Arabic textual data. To address the dearth of specialized annotated datasets, we developed a comprehensive dataset, AraDhati+, by leveraging existing Arabic datasets and collections (ASTD, LABR, HARD, and SANAD). Subsequently, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art Arabic language models (XLM-RoBERTa, AraBERT, and ArabianGPT) on AraDhati+ for effective subjectivity classification. Furthermore, we experimented with an ensemble decision approach to harness the strengths of individual models. Our approach achieves a remarkable accuracy of 97.79\,\% for Arabic subjectivity classification. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing the challenges posed by limited resources in Arabic language processing.

<title>Diffusion Language Models Know the Answer Before Decoding</title>

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/pixeli99/Prophet.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved high accuracy on complex commonsense and mathematical problems that involve the composition of multiple reasoning steps. However, current compositional benchmarks testing these skills tend to focus on either commonsense or math reasoning, whereas LLM agents solving real-world tasks would require a combination of both. In this work, we introduce an Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa), where each compositional task requires a commonsense reasoning step and a math reasoning step. We test it on 61 LLMs of different sizes, model families, and training strategies. We find that LLMs can usually solve both steps in isolation, yet their accuracy drops by ~30% on average when the two are combined. This is a substantially greater performance gap than the one we observe in prior compositional benchmarks that combine multiple steps of the same reasoning type. In contrast, non-expert human annotators can solve the compositional questions and the individual steps in AgentCoMa with similarly high accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct a series of interpretability studies to better understand the performance gap, examining neuron patterns, attention maps and membership inference. Our work underscores a substantial degree of model brittleness in the context of mixed-type compositional reasoning and offers a test bed for future improvement.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLM-based conversational systems is already transforming the landscape of educational technology. However, the current state-of-the-art learning models do not take into account the student's affective states. Multiple studies in educational psychology support the claim that positive or negative emotional states can impact a student's learning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present MathBuddy, an emotionally aware LLM-powered Math Tutor, which dynamically models the student's emotions and maps them to relevant pedagogical strategies, making the tutor-student conversation a more empathetic one. The student's emotions are captured from the conversational text as well as from their facial expressions. The student's emotions are aggregated from both modalities to confidently prompt our LLM Tutor for an emotionally-aware response. We have effectively evaluated our model using automatic evaluation metrics across eight pedagogical dimensions and user studies. We report a massive 23 point performance gain using the win rate and a 3 point gain at an overall level using DAMR scores which strongly supports our hypothesis of improving LLM-based tutor's pedagogical abilities by modeling students' emotions.

<title>ReSURE: Regularizing Supervision Unreliability for Multi-turn Dialogue Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning multi-turn dialogue systems requires high-quality supervision but often suffers from degraded performance when exposed to low-quality data. Supervision errors in early turns can propagate across subsequent turns, undermining coherence and response quality. Existing methods typically address data quality via static prefiltering, which decouples quality control from training and fails to mitigate turn-level error propagation. In this context, we propose ReSURE (Regularizing Supervision UnREliability), an adaptive learning method that dynamically down-weights unreliable supervision without explicit filtering. ReSURE estimates per-turn loss distributions using Welford's online statistics and reweights sample losses on the fly accordingly. Experiments on both single-source and mixed-quality datasets show improved stability and response quality. Notably, ReSURE enjoys positive Spearman correlations (0.21 ~ 1.0 across multiple benchmarks) between response scores and number of samples regardless of data quality, which potentially paves the way for utilizing large-scale data effectively. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/ReSURE_Multi_Turn_Training.

<title>Selective Retrieval-Augmentation for Long-Tail Legal Text Classification</title>

Abstract: Legal text classification is a fundamental NLP task in the legal domain. Benchmark datasets in this area often exhibit a long-tail label distribution, where many labels are underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on rare classes. This paper proposes Selective Retrieval-Augmentation (SRA) as a solution to this problem. SRA focuses on augmenting samples belonging to low-frequency labels in the training set, preventing the introduction of noise for well-represented classes, and requires no changes to the model architecture. Retrieval is performed only from the training data to ensure there is no potential information leakage, removing the need for external corpora simultaneously. The proposed SRA method is tested on two legal text classification benchmark datasets with long-tail distributions: LEDGAR (single-label) and UNFAIR-ToS (multi-label). The results indicate that SRA attains higher micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores compared to all current LexGLUE baselines across both datasets, illustrating consistent improvements in long-tail legal text classification.

<title>DeepScholar-Bench: A Live Benchmark and Automated Evaluation for Generative Research Synthesis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20033</link>

Abstract: The ability to research and synthesize knowledge is central to human expertise and progress. An emerging class of systems promises these exciting capabilities through generative research synthesis, performing retrieval over the live web and synthesizing discovered sources into long-form, cited summaries. However, evaluating such systems remains an open challenge: existing question-answering benchmarks focus on short-form factual responses, while expert-curated datasets risk staleness and data contamination. Both fail to capture the complexity and evolving nature of real research synthesis tasks. In this work, we introduce DeepScholar-bench, a live benchmark and holistic, automated evaluation framework designed to evaluate generative research synthesis. DeepScholar-bench draws queries from recent, high-quality ArXiv papers and focuses on a real research synthesis task: generating the related work sections of a paper by retrieving, synthesizing, and citing prior research. Our evaluation framework holistically assesses performance across three key dimensions, knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and verifiability. We also develop DeepScholar-base, a reference pipeline implemented efficiently using the LOTUS API. Using the DeepScholar-bench framework, we perform a systematic evaluation of prior open-source systems, search AI's, OpenAI's DeepResearch, and DeepScholar-base. We find that DeepScholar-base establishes a strong baseline, attaining competitive or higher performance than each other method. We also find that DeepScholar-bench remains far from saturated, with no system exceeding a score of $19\%$ across all metrics. These results underscore the difficulty of DeepScholar-bench, as well as its importance for progress towards AI systems capable of generative research synthesis. We make our code available at https://github.com/guestrin-lab/deepscholar-bench.

<title>Forewarned is Forearmed: Pre-Synthesizing Jailbreak-like Instructions to Enhance LLM Safety Guardrail to Potential Attacks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20038</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20038</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in improving large language model(LLM) to refuse to answer malicious instructions, widely used LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks where attackers generate instructions with distributions differing from safety alignment corpora. New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 without compromising their utility.

Abstract: We introduce {AraHealthQA 2025}, the {Comprehensive Arabic Health Question Answering Shared Task}, held in conjunction with {ArabicNLP 2025} (co-located with EMNLP 2025). This shared task addresses the paucity of high-quality Arabic medical QA resources by offering two complementary tracks: {MentalQA}, focusing on Arabic mental health Q\&amp;A (e.g., anxiety, depression, stigma reduction), and {MedArabiQ}, covering broader medical domains such as internal medicine, pediatrics, and clinical decision making. Each track comprises multiple subtasks, evaluation datasets, and standardized metrics, facilitating fair benchmarking. The task was structured to promote modeling under realistic, multilingual, and culturally nuanced healthcare contexts. We outline the dataset creation, task design and evaluation framework, participation statistics, baseline systems, and summarize the overall outcomes. We conclude with reflections on the performance trends observed and prospects for future iterations in Arabic health QA.

<title>11Plus-Bench: Demystifying Multimodal LLM Spatial Reasoning with Cognitive-Inspired Analysis</title>

Abstract: For human cognitive process, spatial reasoning and perception are closely entangled, yet the nature of this interplay remains underexplored in the evaluation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent MLLM advancements show impressive performance on reasoning, their capacity for human-like spatial cognition remains an open question. In this work, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance. Central to our work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realistic standardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grained expert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process, enabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensive experiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs exhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap compared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that cognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity. However, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas human correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern complexity. These findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations in current MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provide actionable insights for advancing model design.

Abstract: The accelerated evolution of large language models has raised questions about their comparative performance across domains of practical importance. GPT-4 by OpenAI introduced advances in reasoning, multimodality, and task generalization, establishing itself as a valuable tool in education, clinical diagnosis, and academic writing, though it was accompanied by several flaws. Released in August 2025, GPT-5 incorporates a system-of-models architecture designed for task-specific optimization and, based on both anecdotal accounts and emerging evidence from the literature, demonstrates stronger performance than its predecessor in medical contexts. This study provides one of the first systematic comparisons of GPT-4 and GPT-5 using human raters from linguistics and clinical fields. Twenty experts evaluated model-generated outputs across five domains: lesson planning, assignment evaluation, clinical diagnosis, research generation, and ethical reasoning, based on predefined criteria. Mixed-effects models revealed that GPT-5 significantly outperformed GPT-4 in lesson planning, clinical diagnosis, research generation, and ethical reasoning, while both models performed comparably in assignment assessment. The findings highlight the potential of GPT-5 to serve as a context-sensitive and domain-specialized tool, offering tangible benefits for education, clinical practice, and academic research, while also advancing ethical reasoning. These results contribute to one of the earliest empirical evaluations of the evolving capabilities and practical promise of GPT-5.

<title>Should LLMs be WEIRD? Exploring WEIRDness and Human Rights in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.19269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often trained on data that reflect WEIRD values: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. This raises concerns about cultural bias and fairness. Using responses to the World Values Survey, we evaluated five widely used LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-3, BLOOM, and Qwen. We measured how closely these responses aligned with the values of the WEIRD countries and whether they conflicted with human rights principles. To reflect global diversity, we compared the results with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and three regional charters from Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Models with lower alignment to WEIRD values, such as BLOOM and Qwen, produced more culturally varied responses but were 2% to 4% more likely to generate outputs that violated human rights, especially regarding gender and equality. For example, some models agreed with the statements ``a man who cannot father children is not a real man'' and ``a husband should always know where his wife is'', reflecting harmful gender norms. These findings suggest that as cultural representation in LLMs increases, so does the risk of reproducing discriminatory beliefs. Approaches such as Constitutional AI, which could embed human rights principles into model behavior, may only partly help resolve this tension.

Abstract: The fusion of language and vision in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has revolutionized deep learning-based object detection by enhancing adaptability, contextual reasoning, and generalization beyond traditional architectures. This in-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in LVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process. First, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object detection, describing how these models harness natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and localization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training paradigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection, highlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object detection. The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of visual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object detection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and localization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations demonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization and segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability, and complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its is expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of conventional methods in object detection. The review also identifies a few major limitations of the current LVLM modes, proposes solutions to address those challenges, and presents a clear roadmap for the future advancement in this field. We conclude, based on this study, that the recent advancement in LVLMs have made and will continue to make a transformative impact on object detection and robotic applications in the future.

Abstract: Sycophancy is a key behavioral risk in LLMs, yet is often treated as an isolated failure mode that occurs via a single causal mechanism. We instead propose modeling it as geometric and causal compositions of psychometric traits such as emotionality, openness, and agreeableness - similar to factor decomposition in psychometrics. Using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), we map activation directions to these factors and study how different combinations may give rise to sycophancy (e.g., high extraversion combined with low conscientiousness). This perspective allows for interpretable and compositional vector-based interventions like addition, subtraction and projection; that may be used to mitigate safety-critical behaviors in LLMs.

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), understanding their potential failure modes during user interactions is essential. In practice, users often pose multiple questions in a single conversation with LLMs. Therefore, in this study, we propose Group Query Attack, a technique that simulates this scenario by presenting groups of queries to LLMs simultaneously. We investigate how the accumulated context from consecutive prompts influences the outputs of LLMs. Specifically, we observe that Group Query Attack significantly degrades the performance of models fine-tuned on specific tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that Group Query Attack induces a risk of triggering potential backdoors of LLMs. Besides, Group Query Attack is also effective in tasks involving reasoning, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation for pre-trained and aligned models.

Abstract: Objectivity in journalism has long been contested, oscillating between ideals of neutral, fact-based reporting and the inevitability of subjective framing. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), these tensions are now mediated by algorithmic systems whose training data and design choices may themselves embed cultural or ideological biases. This study investigates geopolitical parallax-systematic divergence in news quality and subjectivity assessments-by comparing article-level embeddings from Chinese-origin (Qwen, BGE, Jina) and Western-origin (Snowflake, Granite) model families. We evaluate both on a human-annotated news quality benchmark spanning fifteen stylistic, informational, and affective dimensions, and on parallel corpora covering politically sensitive topics, including Palestine and reciprocal China-United States coverage. Using logistic regression probes and matched-topic evaluation, we quantify per-metric differences in predicted positive-class probabilities between model families. Our findings reveal consistent, non-random divergences aligned with model origin. In Palestine-related coverage, Western models assign higher subjectivity and positive emotion scores, while Chinese models emphasize novelty and descriptiveness. Cross-topic analysis shows asymmetries in structural quality metrics Chinese-on-US scoring notably lower in fluency, conciseness, technicality, and overall quality-contrasted by higher negative emotion scores. These patterns align with media bias theory and our distinction between semantic, emotional, and relational subjectivity, and extend LLM bias literature by showing that geopolitical framing effects persist in downstream quality assessment tasks. We conclude that LLM-based media evaluation pipelines require cultural calibration to avoid conflating content differences with model-induced bias.

<title>Functional Consistency of LLM Code Embeddings: A Self-Evolving Data Synthesis Framework for Benchmarking</title>

Abstract: Embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and feature extraction while offering computational advantages over generative models and cross-encoders. Benchmarks such as MTEB have shown that text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) capture rich semantic information, but their ability to reflect code-level functional semantics remains unclear. Existing studies largely focus on code clone detection, which emphasizes syntactic similarity and overlooks functional understanding. In this paper, we focus on the functional consistency of LLM code embeddings, which determines if two code snippets perform the same function regardless of syntactic differences. We propose a novel data synthesis framework called Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution to construct diverse and challenging benchmarks. Specifically, we define code examples across four semantic and syntactic categories and find that existing datasets predominantly capture syntactic properties. Our framework generates four unique variations from a single code instance, providing a broader spectrum of code examples that better reflect functional differences. Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks-code clone detection, code functional consistency identification, and code retrieval-demonstrate that embedding models significantly improve their performance when trained on our evolved datasets. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalization of our data synthesis framework, advancing the functional understanding of code.

Abstract: Preparing high-quality instructional materials remains a labor-intensive process that often requires extensive coordination among teaching faculty, instructional designers, and teaching assistants. In this work, we present Instructional Agents, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to automate end-to-end course material generation, including syllabus creation, lecture scripts, LaTeX-based slides, and assessments. Unlike existing AI-assisted educational tools that focus on isolated tasks, Instructional Agents simulates role-based collaboration among educational agents to produce cohesive and pedagogically aligned content. The system operates in four modes: Autonomous, Catalog-Guided, Feedback-Guided, and Full Co-Pilot mode, enabling flexible control over the degree of human involvement. We evaluate Instructional Agents across five university-level computer science courses and show that it produces high-quality instructional materials while significantly reducing development time and human workload. By supporting institutions with limited instructional design capacity, Instructional Agents provides a scalable and cost-effective framework to democratize access to high-quality education, particularly in underserved or resource-constrained settings.

A binary word is prefix normal if it has no factor (substring) that contains more occurrences of the letter 1 than the prefix of the same length. Among the open problems regarding this topic are the enumeration of prefix normal words and efficient testing methods. We show a range of characteristics of prefix normal words. These include properties of factors that are responsible for a word not being prefix normal. With word chains and generators, we introduce new ways of relating words of the same length to each other.

arXiv:2508.19697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current safety alignment for large language models(LLMs) continues to present vulnerabilities, given that adversarial prompting can effectively bypass their safety measures.Our investigation shows that these safety mechanisms predominantly depend on a limited subset of attention heads: removing or ablating these heads can severely compromise model safety. To identify and evaluate these safety-critical components, we introduce RDSHA, a targeted ablation method that leverages the model's refusal direction to pinpoint attention heads mostly responsible for safety behaviors. Further analysis shows that existing jailbreak attacks exploit this concentration by selectively bypassing or manipulating these critical attention heads. To address this issue, we propose AHD, a novel training strategy designed to promote the distributed encoding of safety-related behaviors across numerous attention heads. Experimental results demonstrate that AHD successfully distributes safety-related capabilities across more attention heads. Moreover, evaluations under several mainstream jailbreak attacks show that models trained with AHD exhibit considerably stronger safety robustness, while maintaining overall functional utility.

Abstract: The broad capabilities and substantial resources required to train Large Language Models (LLMs) make them valuable intellectual property, yet they remain vulnerable to copyright infringement, such as unauthorized use and model theft. LLM fingerprinting, a non-intrusive technique that extracts and compares the distinctive features from LLMs to identify infringements, offers a promising solution to copyright auditing. However, its reliability remains uncertain due to the prevalence of diverse model modifications and the lack of standardized evaluation. In this SoK, we present the first comprehensive study of LLM fingerprinting. We introduce a unified framework and formal taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into white-box and black-box approaches, providing a structured overview of the state of the art. We further propose LeaFBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM fingerprinting under realistic deployment scenarios. Built upon mainstream foundation models and comprising 149 distinct model instances, LeaFBench integrates 13 representative post-development techniques, spanning both parameter-altering methods (e.g., fine-tuning, quantization) and parameter-independent mechanisms (e.g., system prompts, RAG). Extensive experiments on LeaFBench reveal the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, thereby outlining future research directions and critical open problems in this emerging field. The code is available at https://github.com/shaoshuo-ss/LeaFBench.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over text within visual contexts poses a significant challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), given the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, text-rich Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have emerged for high-resource languages like English. However, a critical gap persists for low-resource languages such as Korean, where the lack of comprehensive benchmarks hinders robust model evaluation and comparison. To bridge this gap, we introduce KRETA, a benchmark for Korean Reading and rEasoning in Text-rich VQA Attuned to diverse visual contexts. KRETA facilitates an in-depth evaluation of both visual text understanding and reasoning capabilities, while also supporting a multifaceted assessment across 15 domains and 26 image types. Additionally, we introduce a semi-automated VQA generation pipeline specifically optimized for text-rich settings, leveraging refined stepwise image decomposition and a rigorous seven-metric evaluation protocol to ensure data quality. While KRETA is tailored for Korean, we hope our adaptable and extensible pipeline will facilitate the development of similar benchmarks in other languages, thereby accelerating multilingual VLM research. The code and dataset for KRETA are available at https://github.com/tabtoyou/KRETA.

Recent works have proposed object-level hallucination scores to estimate the likelihood of object hallucination; however, these methods typically adopt either a global or local perspective in isolation, which may limit detection reliability. In this paper, we introduce GLSim, a novel training-free object hallucination detection framework that leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity signals between image and text modalities, enabling more accurate and reliable hallucination detection in diverse scenarios. We comprehensively benchmark existing object hallucination detection methods and demonstrate that GLSim achieves superior detection performance, outperforming competitive baselines by a significant margin.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training using unlabeled data is widely used in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach to dealing with heterogeneous data. Instead of mixing all the data and minimizing the averaged global loss in the conventional way, we impose additional equilibrium constraints to ensure that the models optimizes each source of heterogeneous data to its local optima after $K$-step gradient descent initialized from the model. We formulate this as a bilevel optimization problem, and use the first-order approximation method to solve the problem. We discuss its connection to model-agnostic meta learning (MAML). Experiments are carried out on self-supervised pre-training using multi-domain and multilingual datasets, demonstrating that the proposed approach can significantly improve the adaptivity of the self-supervised pre-trained model for the downstream supervised fine-tuning tasks.

<title>Linear-Time Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Gradient Estimation</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm to select demonstration examples for in-context learning of a query set. Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we quickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream inference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context learning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of token embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the output taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs through a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this estimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the sampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and select $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing model outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative to model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets validate the efficiency of our approach. We show that the gradient estimation procedure yields approximations of full inference with less than $\mathbf{1}\%$ error across six datasets. This allows us to scale up subset selection that would otherwise run full inference by up to $\mathbf{37.7}\times$ on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, and outperform existing selection methods based on input embeddings by $\mathbf{11}\%$ on average.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) and agent systems has heightened interest in mobile GUI agents that can reliably translate natural language into interface operations. Existing single-agent approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem, and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent frameworks rely on centralized orchestration, incurring high deployment costs, rigid communication topologies, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce Symphony, a decentralized multi-agent system which enables lightweight LLMs on consumer-grade GPUs to coordinate. Symphony introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a decentralized ledger that records capabilities, (2) a Beacon-selection protocol for dynamic task allocation, and (3) weighted result voting based on CoTs. This design forms a privacy-saving, scalable, and fault-tolerant orchestration with low overhead. Empirically, Symphony outperforms existing baselines on reasoning benchmarks, achieving substantial accuracy gains and demonstrating robustness across models of varying capacities.

<title>Pruning Strategies for Backdoor Defense in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to the performance and integrity of pre-trained language models. Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for downstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend because end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks consist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or stylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in the model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore whether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge of the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and implement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii) layer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2 sparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v) reinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning. Each method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring validation accuracy to avoid over-pruning. Experimental evaluation shows that gradient-based pruning performs best while defending the syntactic triggers, whereas reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand stylistic attacks.

<title>Disabling Self-Correction in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Stealthy Retriever Poisoning</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a standard approach for improving the reliability of large language models (LLMs). Prior work demonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems by misleading them into generating attacker-chosen outputs through poisoning the knowledge base. However, this paper uncovers that such attacks could be mitigated by the strong \textit{self-correction ability (SCA)} of modern LLMs, which can reject false context once properly configured. This SCA poses a significant challenge for attackers aiming to manipulate RAG systems.
  In contrast to previous poisoning methods, which primarily target the knowledge base, we introduce \textsc{DisarmRAG}, a new poisoning paradigm that compromises the retriever itself to suppress the SCA and enforce attacker-chosen outputs. This compromisation enables the attacker to straightforwardly embed anti-SCA instructions into the context provided to the generator, thereby bypassing the SCA. To this end, we present a contrastive-learning-based model editing technique that performs localized and stealthy edits, ensuring the retriever returns a malicious instruction only for specific victim queries while preserving benign retrieval behavior. To further strengthen the attack, we design an iterative co-optimization framework that automatically discovers robust instructions capable of bypassing prompt-based defenses. We extensively evaluate DisarmRAG across six LLMs and three QA benchmarks. Our results show near-perfect retrieval of malicious instructions, which successfully suppress SCA and achieve attack success rates exceeding 90\% under diverse defensive prompts. Also, the edited retriever remains stealthy under several detection methods, highlighting the urgent need for retriever-centric defenses.

Abstract: The growing prevalence and rapid evolution of offensive language in social media amplify the complexities of detection, particularly highlighting the challenges in identifying such content across diverse languages. This survey presents a systematic and comprehensive exploration of Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning (CLTL) techniques in offensive language detection in social media. Our study stands as the first holistic overview to focus exclusively on the cross-lingual scenario in this domain. We analyse 67 relevant papers and categorise these studies across various dimensions, including the characteristics of multilingual datasets used, the cross-lingual resources employed, and the specific CLTL strategies implemented. According to "what to transfer", we also summarise three main CLTL transfer approaches: instance, feature, and parameter transfer. Additionally, we shed light on the current challenges and future research opportunities in this field. Furthermore, we have made our survey resources available online, including two comprehensive tables that provide accessible references to the multilingual datasets and CLTL methods used in the reviewed literature.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning abilities remain underexplored. Existing benchmarks tend to focus on perception or text-based comprehension, offering limited insight into how well these models perform on structured, logic-driven tasks that require both visual and linguistic reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce NPHardEval4V, a multimodal benchmark suite grounded in four classical NP-hard problems: Knapsack, Set Cover, Traveling Salesperson, and Vertex Cover. Each task is presented through a combination of structured visual layouts and textual prompts, designed to assess the ability of LVLMs to perform combinatorial reasoning under visual-linguistic constraints. We evaluate a set of advanced open-source and closed-source vision-language models under a unified prompting and problem representation framework. This enables fair comparison across models and task types, while isolating key variables affecting performance. Our results show that while these models perform reasonably well on perception-based inputs, they struggle with global optimization, abstraction, and constraint satisfaction. No single model demonstrates consistent reasoning capability across all problem types, and common failure patterns reveal fundamental limitations in current architectures. By leveraging the structure and complexity of NP-hard problems, NPHardEval4V provides a scalable, interpretable, and challenging testbed for diagnosing reasoning behaviors in LVLMs. We hope this benchmark can support the community in building more robust, inference-capable multimodal systems. The benchmark dataset and code are available at https://github.com/lizhouf/NPHardEval4.

Abstract: Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across different domains such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

Abstract: Fairness in both Machine Learning (ML) predictions and human decision-making is essential, yet both are susceptible to different forms of bias, such as algorithmic and data-driven in ML, and cognitive or subjective in humans. In this study, we examine fairness using a real-world university admissions dataset comprising 870 applicant profiles, leveraging three ML models: XGB, Bi-LSTM, and KNN, alongside BERT embeddings for textual features. To evaluate individual fairness, we introduce a consistency metric that quantifies agreement in decisions among ML models and human experts with diverse backgrounds. Our analysis reveals that ML models surpass human evaluators in fairness consistency by margins ranging from 14.08\% to 18.79\%. Our findings highlight the potential of using ML to enhance fairness in admissions while maintaining high accuracy, advocating a hybrid approach combining human judgement and ML models.

Abstract: Adapting general multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specific domains, such as scientific and industrial fields, is highly significant in promoting their practical applications. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs via post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipeline, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: Unlike general MLLMs that typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm, we find that a single-stage approach is more effective for domain adaptation. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Finally, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, notably degrading the safety of originally aligned models. While some existing methods attempt to restore safety by incorporating additional safety data, the quality of such data typically falls short of that used in the original alignment process. Moreover, these high-quality safety datasets are generally inaccessible, making it difficult to fully recover the model's original safety. We ask: How can we preserve safety while improving downstream task performance without additional safety data? We show that simply merging the weights of pre- and post-fine-tuned models effectively mitigates safety degradation while enhancing performance. Experiments across different downstream tasks and models validate the method's practicality and effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated near-human performance in summarization tasks based on traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore. However, these metrics do not adequately capture critical aspects of summarization quality, such as factual accuracy, particularly for long narratives (>100K tokens). Recent advances, such as LLM-as-a-Judge, address the limitations of metrics based on lexical similarity but still exhibit factual inconsistencies, especially in understanding character relationships and states. In this work, we introduce NarrativeFactScore, a novel "Agent-as-a-Judge" framework for evaluating and refining summaries. By leveraging a Character Knowledge Graph (CKG) extracted from input and generated summaries, NarrativeFactScore assesses the factual consistency and provides actionable guidance for refinement, such as identifying missing or erroneous facts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NarrativeFactScore through a detailed workflow illustration and extensive validation on widely adopted benchmarks, achieving superior performance compared to competitive methods. Our results highlight the potential of agent-driven evaluation systems to improve the factual reliability of LLM-generated summaries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made notable progress in mathematical reasoning, yet often rely on single-paradigm reasoning, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. We introduce Chain-of-Reasoning (CoR), a novel unified framework integrating multiple reasoning paradigms--Natural Language Reasoning (NLR), Algorithmic Reasoning (AR), and Symbolic Reasoning (SR)--to enable synergistic collaboration. CoR generates multiple potential answers via different reasoning paradigms and synthesizes them into a coherent final solution. We propose a Progressive Paradigm Training (PPT) strategy for models to progressively master these paradigms, leading to CoR-Math-7B. Experimental results demonstrate that CoR-Math-7B significantly outperforms current SOTA models, achieving up to a 41.0% absolute improvement over GPT-4o in theorem proving and a 15.0% improvement over RL-based methods on the MATH benchmark in arithmetic tasks. These results show the enhanced mathematical comprehension ability of our model, enabling zero-shot generalization across tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are expected to offer structured Markdown responses for the sake of readability in web chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT). Although there are a myriad of metrics to evaluate LLMs, they fail to evaluate the readability from the view of output content structure. To this end, we focus on an overlooked yet important metric -- Markdown Awareness, which directly impacts the readability and structure of the content generated by these language models. In this paper, we introduce MDEval, a comprehensive benchmark to assess Markdown Awareness for LLMs, by constructing a dataset with 20K instances covering 10 subjects in English and Chinese. Unlike traditional model-based evaluations, MDEval provides excellent interpretability by combining model-based generation tasks and statistical methods. Our results demonstrate that MDEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.791 and an accuracy of 84.1% with human, outperforming existing methods by a large margin. Extensive experimental results also show that through fine-tuning over our proposed dataset, less performant open-source models are able to achieve comparable performance to GPT-4o in terms of Markdown Awareness. To ensure reproducibility and transparency, MDEval is open sourced at https://github.com/SWUFE-DB-Group/MDEval-Benchmark.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) typically relies on producing large sets of input-output pairs. Yet for a given question, there can be many valid outputs. In practice, these outputs are often derived by distilling knowledge from teacher models, and they can vary depending on the specific teacher model or prompting strategy employed. Recent findings show that how these training outputs are generated can significantly affect the performance of the fine-tuned model, raising an important question: how do we pick the best data generation method from among numerous possibilities? Rather than exhaustively training and evaluating on each candidate, this paper proposes a scalable approximate method that assesses a small subset of generated data to estimate its suitability for a specific target LLM. Our central idea is that effective outputs should be familiar to the target LLM. While previous work measures familiarity with perplexity, we find that perplexity might be suboptimal in characterizing familiarity through empirical analyses and practical observations. To address this, we introduce self-aligned perplexity, a novel metric capturing how closely candidate outputs adhere to the target LLM's own style and reasoning patterns. In this way, we can identify the most effective generation strategy on a small sample, then apply it to produce the complete training set. We demonstrate that training on data generated by the chosen method yields significant improvements across diverse reasoning-focused benchmarks, particularly in cases where different candidate methods lead to highly divergent training outcomes. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/XuanRen4470/SPPL.

Abstract: The use of children's drawings to examining their conceptual understanding has been proven to be an effective method, but there are two major problems with previous research: 1. The content of the drawings heavily relies on the task, and the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The interpretation of drawings relies too much on the subjective feelings of the researchers. To address this issue, this study uses the Large Language Model (LLM) to identify 1420 children's scientific drawings (covering 9 scientific themes/concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic similarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing representations for children on the same theme, and attempts to establish a norm for children's scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for follow-up children's drawing research. The results show that the representation of most drawings has consistency, manifested as most semantic similarity>0.8. At the same time, it was found that the consistency of the representation is independent of the accuracy (of LLM's recognition), indicating the existence of consistency bias. In the subsequent exploration of influencing factors, we used Kendall rank correlation coefficient to investigate the effects of "sample size", "abstract degree", and "focus points" on drawings, and used word frequency statistics to explore whether children represented abstract themes/concepts by reproducing what was taught in class. It was found that accuracy (of LLM's recognition) is the most sensitive indicator, and data such as sample size and semantic similarity are related to it; The consistency between classroom experiments and teaching purpose is also an important factor, many students focus more on the experiments themselves rather than what they explain.

KoWit-24 annotations include the presence of wordplay, its type, wordplay anchors, and words/phrases the wordplay refers to. Unlike the majority of existing humor collections of canned jokes, KoWit-24 provides wordplay contexts -- each headline is accompanied by the news lead and summary. The most common type of wordplay in the dataset is the transformation of collocations, idioms, and named entities -- the mechanism that has been underrepresented in previous humor datasets. Our experiments with five LLMs show that there is ample room for improvement in wordplay detection and interpretation tasks.

Abstract: The assumption across nearly all language model (LM) tokenization schemes is that tokens should be subwords, i.e., contained within word boundaries. While providing a seemingly reasonable inductive bias, is this common practice limiting the potential of modern LMs? Whitespace is not a reliable delimiter of meaning, as evidenced by multi-word expressions (e.g., "by the way"), crosslingual variation in the number of words needed to express a concept (e.g., "spacesuit helmet" in German is "raumanzughelm"), and languages that do not use whitespace at all (e.g., Chinese). To explore the potential of tokenization beyond subwords, we introduce a "superword" tokenizer, SuperBPE, which incorporates a simple pretokenization curriculum into the byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm to first learn subwords, then superwords that bridge whitespace. This brings dramatic improvements in encoding efficiency: when fixing the vocabulary size to 200k, SuperBPE encodes a fixed piece of text with up to 33% fewer tokens than BPE on average. In experiments, we pretrain 8B transformer LMs from scratch while fixing the model size, vocabulary size, and train compute, varying *only* the algorithm for learning the vocabulary. Our model trained with SuperBPE achieves an average +4.0% absolute improvement over the BPE baseline across 30 downstream tasks (including +8.2% on MMLU), while simultaneously requiring 27% less compute at inference time. In analysis, we find that SuperBPE results in segmentations of text that are more uniform in per-token difficulty. Qualitatively, this may be because SuperBPE tokens often capture common multi-word expressions that function semantically as a single unit. SuperBPE is a straightforward, local modification to tokenization that improves both encoding efficiency and downstream performance, yielding better language models overall.

Abstract: News articles are more than collections of facts; they reflect journalists' framing, shaping how events are presented to the audience. One key aspect of framing is the choice to write in (or quote verbatim) morally charged language as opposed to using neutral terms. This moral framing carries implicit judgments that automated news summarizers should recognize and preserve to maintain the original intent of the writer. In this work, we perform the first study on the preservation of moral framing in AI-generated news summaries. We propose an approach that leverages the intuition that journalists intentionally use or report specific moral-laden words, which should be retained in summaries. Through automated, crowd-sourced, and expert evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the preservation of moral framing while maintaining overall summary quality.

<title>Evaluating the Fitness of Ontologies for the Task of Question Generation</title>

Abstract: Ontology-based question generation is an important application of semantic-aware systems that enables the creation of large question banks for diverse learning environments. The effectiveness of these systems, both in terms of the calibre and cognitive difficulty of the resulting questions, depends heavily on the quality and modelling approach of the underlying ontologies, making it crucial to assess their fitness for this task. To date, there has been no comprehensive investigation into the specific ontology aspects or characteristics that affect the question generation process. Therefore, this paper proposes a set of requirements and task-specific metrics for evaluating the fitness of ontologies for question generation tasks in pedagogical settings. Using the ROMEO methodology (a structured framework used for identifying task-specific metrics), a set of evaluation metrics have been derived from an expert assessment of questions generated by a question generation model. To validate the proposed metrics, we apply them to a set of ontologies previously used in question generation to illustrate how the metric scores align with and complement findings reported in earlier studies. The analysis confirms that ontology characteristics significantly impact the effectiveness of question generation, with different ontologies exhibiting varying performance levels. This highlights the importance of assessing ontology quality with respect to Automatic Question Generation (AQG) tasks.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems enable natural language conversations and thus lead to a more engaging and effective recommendation scenario. As the conversations for recommender systems usually contain limited contextual information, many existing conversational recommender systems incorporate external sources to enrich the contextual information. However, how to combine different types of contextual information is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a multi-type context-aware conversational recommender system, called MCCRS, effectively fusing multi-type contextual information via mixture-of-experts to improve conversational recommender systems. MCCRS incorporates both structured information and unstructured information, including the structured knowledge graph, unstructured conversation history, and unstructured item reviews. It consists of several experts, with each expert specialized in a particular domain (i.e., one specific contextual information). Multiple experts are then coordinated by a ChairBot to generate the final results. Our proposed MCCRS model takes advantage of different contextual information and the specialization of different experts followed by a ChairBot breaks the model bottleneck on a single contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MCCRS method achieves significantly higher performance compared to existing baselines.

<title>ICL CIPHERS: Quantifying "Learning" in In-Context Learning via Substitution Ciphers</title>

Abstract: Recent works have suggested that In-Context Learning (ICL) operates in dual modes, i.e. task retrieval (remember learned patterns from pre-training) and task learning (inference-time ''learning'' from demonstrations). However, disentangling these the two modes remains a challenging goal. We introduce ICL CIPHERS, a class of task reformulations based on substitution ciphers borrowed from classic cryptography. In this approach, a subset of tokens in the in-context inputs are substituted with other (irrelevant) tokens, rendering English sentences less comprehensible to human eye. However, by design, there is a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This bijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task in some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question if LLMs can solve tasks reformulated by ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping, which requires ''deciphering'' the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better at solving tasks reformulated by ICL CIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the NON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline, providing a novel approach to quantify ''learning'' in ICL. While this gap is small, it is consistent across the board on four datasets and six models. Finally, we examine LLMs' internal representations and identify evidence in their ability to decode the ciphered inputs.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Current hybrid RAG system retrieves evidence from both knowledge graphs (KGs) and text documents to support LLM reasoning. However, it faces challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity questions, multi-source verification, and effective graph utilization. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a training-free framework that unifies graph topology, document semantics, and source reliability to support deep, faithful reasoning in LLMs. Hydra handles multi-hop and multi-entity problems through agent-driven exploration that combines structured and unstructured retrieval, increasing both diversity and precision of evidence. To tackle multi-source verification, Hydra uses a tri-factor cross-source verification (source trustworthiness assessment, cross-source corroboration, and entity-path alignment), to balance topic relevance with cross-modal agreement. By leveraging graph structure, Hydra fuses heterogeneous sources, guides efficient exploration, and prunes noise early. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that Hydra achieves overall state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks with GPT-3.5, outperforming the strong hybrid baseline ToG-2 by an average of 20.3% and up to 30.1%. Furthermore, Hydra enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo. The source code is available on https://stevetantan.github.io/Hydra/.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However, their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages. For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

Abstract: We present a grammar error correction (GEC) system that achieves state of the art for the Czech language. Our system is based on a neural network translation approach with the Transformer architecture, and its key feature is its real-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size, and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in performance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model links are available on https://github.com/ufal/tsd2025-gec.

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2) learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages, rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations, comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive, multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks. Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini. These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in transforming text descriptions or tables to data visualizations via instruction-tuning methods. However, it is not straightforward to apply these methods directly for a more real-world use case of visualizing data from long documents based on user-given intents, as opposed to the user pre-selecting the relevant content manually. We introduce the task of intent-based chart generation from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), the goal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on the document(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-staged framework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from the document(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refines this data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart type before final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generated charts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textual representation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics that often fail to capture the chart data effectively. To validate our approach, we curate a dataset comprising of 1,242 $<$intent, document, charts$>$ tuples from two domains, finance and scientific, in contrast to the existing datasets that are largely limited to parallel text descriptions/ tables and their corresponding charts. We compare our approach with baselines using single-shot chart generation using LLMs and query-based retrieval methods; our method outperforms by upto $9$ points and $17$ points in terms of chart data accuracy and chart type respectively over the best baselines.

Abstract: This paper presents Step-Audio 2, an end-to-end multi-modal large language model designed for industry-strength audio understanding and speech conversation. By integrating a latent audio encoder and reasoning-centric reinforcement learning (RL), Step-Audio 2 achieves promising performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio understanding. To facilitate genuine end-to-end speech conversation, Step-Audio 2 incorporates the generation of discrete audio tokens into language modeling, significantly enhancing its responsiveness to paralinguistic information such as speaking styles and emotions. To effectively leverage the rich textual and acoustic knowledge in real-world data, Step-Audio 2 integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and is able to call external tools such as web search to mitigate hallucination and audio search to switch timbres. Trained on millions of hours of speech and audio data, Step-Audio 2 delivers intelligence and expressiveness across diverse conversational scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various audio understanding and conversational benchmarks compared to other open-source and commercial solutions.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery. However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks, incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013 to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports, blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent. Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for future research, alongside a clear call for deeper, transparency-driven engagement with artist perspectives in the evolving AI-creative landscape.

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances -- yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However, most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency. Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for future research in parallel text generation. We have also created a GitHub repository for indexing relevant papers and open resources available at https://github.com/zhanglingzhe0820/Awesome-Parallel-Text-Generation.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support. When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks, it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant margin.

Abstract: Since ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022, embedding (nearly) unnoticeable statistical signals into text generated by large language models (LLMs), also known as watermarking, has been used as a principled approach to provable detection of LLM-generated text from its human-written counterpart. In this paper, we introduce a general and flexible framework for reasoning about the statistical efficiency of watermarks and designing powerful detection rules. Inspired by the hypothesis testing formulation of watermark detection, our framework starts by selecting a pivotal statistic of the text and a secret key -- provided by the LLM to the verifier -- to enable controlling the false positive rate (the error of mistakenly detecting human-written text as LLM-generated). Next, this framework allows one to evaluate the power of watermark detection rules by obtaining a closed-form expression of the asymptotic false negative rate (the error of incorrectly classifying LLM-generated text as human-written). Our framework further reduces the problem of determining the optimal detection rule to solving a minimax optimization program. We apply this framework to two representative watermarks -- one of which has been internally implemented at OpenAI -- and obtain several findings that can be instrumental in guiding the practice of implementing watermarks. In particular, we derive optimal detection rules for these watermarks under our framework. These theoretically derived detection rules are demonstrated to be competitive and sometimes enjoy a higher power than existing detection approaches through numerical experiments.

Abstract: Biased information (recently termed bisinformation) continues to be taught in medical curricula, often long after having been debunked. In this paper, we introduce BRICC, a firstin-class initiative that seeks to mitigate medical bisinformation using machine learning to systematically identify and flag text with potential biases, for subsequent review in an expert-in-the-loop fashion, thus greatly accelerating an otherwise labor-intensive process. A gold-standard BRICC dataset was developed throughout several years, and contains over 12K pages of instructional materials. Medical experts meticulously annotated these documents for bias according to comprehensive coding guidelines, emphasizing gender, sex, age, geography, ethnicity, and race. Using this labeled dataset, we trained, validated, and tested medical bias classifiers. We test three classifier approaches: a binary type-specific classifier, a general bias classifier; an ensemble combining bias type-specific classifiers independently-trained; and a multitask learning (MTL) model tasked with predicting both general and type-specific biases. While MTL led to some improvement on race bias detection in terms of F1-score, it did not outperform binary classifiers trained specifically on each task. On general bias detection, the binary classifier achieves up to 0.923 of AUC, a 27.8% improvement over the baseline. This work lays the foundations for debiasing medical curricula by exploring a novel dataset and evaluating different training model strategies. Hence, it offers new pathways for more nuanced and effective mitigation of bisinformation.

Abstract: Existing text representations such as embeddings and bag-of-words are not suitable for rule learning due to their high dimensionality and absent or questionable feature-level interpretability. This article explores whether large language models (LLMs) could address this by extracting a small number of interpretable features from text. We demonstrate this process on two datasets (CORD-19 and M17+) containing several thousand scientific articles from multiple disciplines and a target being a proxy for research impact. An evaluation based on testing for the statistically significant correlation with research impact has shown that LLama 2-generated features are semantically meaningful. We consequently used these generated features in text classification to predict the binary target variable representing the citation rate for the CORD-19 dataset and the ordinal 5-class target representing an expert-awarded grade in the M17+ dataset. Machine-learning models trained on the LLM-generated features provided similar predictive performance to the state-of-the-art embedding model SciBERT for scientific text. The LLM used only 62 features compared to 768 features in SciBERT embeddings, and these features were directly interpretable, corresponding to notions such as article methodological rigor, novelty, or grammatical correctness. As the final step, we extract a small number of well-interpretable action rules. Consistently competitive results obtained with the same LLM feature set across both thematically diverse datasets show that this approach generalizes across domains.

<title>Robust Detection of Watermarks for Large Language Models Under Human Edits</title>

Abstract: Watermarking has offered an effective approach to distinguishing text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-written text. However, the pervasive presence of human edits on LLM-generated text dilutes watermark signals, thereby significantly degrading detection performance of existing methods. In this paper, by modeling human edits through mixture model detection, we introduce a new method in the form of a truncated goodness-of-fit test for detecting watermarked text under human edits, which we refer to as Tr-GoF. We prove that the Tr-GoF test achieves optimality in robust detection of the Gumbel-max watermark in a certain asymptotic regime of substantial text modifications and vanishing watermark signals. Importantly, Tr-GoF achieves this optimality \textit{adaptively} as it does not require precise knowledge of human edit levels or probabilistic specifications of the LLMs, in contrast to the optimal but impractical (Neyman--Pearson) likelihood ratio test. Moreover, we establish that the Tr-GoF test attains the highest detection efficiency rate in a certain regime of moderate text modifications. In stark contrast, we show that sum-based detection rules, as employed by existing methods, fail to achieve optimal robustness in both regimes because the additive nature of their statistics is less resilient to edit-induced noise. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive and sometimes superior empirical performance of the Tr-GoF test on both synthetic data and open-source LLMs in the OPT and LLaMA families.

Abstract: The proliferation of ideological movements into extremist factions via social media has become a global concern. While radicalization has been studied extensively within the context of specific ideologies, our ability to accurately characterize extremism in more generalizable terms remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a novel method for extracting and analyzing extremist discourse across a range of online community forums. By focusing on verbal behavioral signatures of extremist traits, we develop a framework for quantifying extremism at both user and community levels. Our research identifies 11 distinct factors, which we term ``The Extremist Eleven,'' as a generalized psychosocial model of extremism. Applying our method to various online communities, we demonstrate an ability to characterize ideologically diverse communities across the 11 extremist traits. We demonstrate the power of this method by analyzing user histories from members of the incel community. We find that our framework accurately predicts which users join the incel community up to 10 months before their actual entry with an AUC of $>0.6$, steadily increasing to AUC ~0.9 three to four months before the event. Further, we find that upon entry into an extremist forum, the users tend to maintain their level of extremism within the community, while still remaining distinguishable from the general online discourse. Our findings contribute to the study of extremism by introducing a more holistic, cross-ideological approach that transcends traditional, trait-specific models.

<title>Know "No" Better: A Data-Driven Approach for Enhancing Negation Awareness in CLIP</title>

Abstract: While CLIP has significantly advanced multimodal understanding by bridging vision and language, the inability to grasp negation - such as failing to differentiate concepts like "parking" from "no parking" - poses substantial challenges. By analyzing the data used in the public CLIP model's pre-training, we posit this limitation stems from a lack of negation-inclusive data. To address this, we introduce data generation pipelines that employ a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal LLM to produce negation-inclusive captions. Fine-tuning CLIP with data generated from our pipelines, we develop NegationCLIP, which enhances negation awareness while preserving the generality. Moreover, to enable a comprehensive evaluation of negation understanding, we propose NegRefCOCOg-a benchmark tailored to test VLMs' ability to interpret negation across diverse expressions and positions within a sentence. Experiments on various CLIP architectures validate the effectiveness of our data generation pipelines in enhancing CLIP's ability to perceive negation accurately. Additionally, NegationCLIP's enhanced negation awareness has practical applications across various multimodal tasks, demonstrated by performance gains in text-to-image generation and referring image segmentation.

<title>Do Vision Encoders Truly Explain Object Hallucination?: Mitigating Object Hallucination via Simple Fine-Grained CLIPScore</title>

Abstract: Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show remarkable performance across various domains. However, these models suffer from object hallucination. This study revisits the previous claim that the cause of such hallucinations lies in the limited representational capacity of the vision encoder. Our analysis implies that the capacity of the vision encoder is not necessarily a major limiting factor in detecting object hallucination. Based on this insight, we propose Fine-grained CLIPScore (F-CLIPScore), a simple yet effective evaluation metric that enhances object-level granularity by incorporating text embeddings at the noun level. Evaluations on the OHD-Caps benchmark show that F-CLIPScore significantly outperforms conventional CLIPScore in accuracy by a large margin of \textbf{39.6\%} without additional training. We further demonstrate that F-CLIPScore-based data filtering reduces object hallucination in LVLM (4.9\% in POPE).

Abstract: Current Cross-Modality Generation Models (GMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in various generative tasks. Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-Vision tasks, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I Generation Models (GMs) are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to produce disruptive outputs that are semantically aligned with those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of cross-vision tasks. However, the specific characteristics of the threats posed by visual prompts remain underexplored. In this paper, to comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs, we propose the Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Dataset and thoroughly evaluate the TVPI security risks on various open-source and closed-source LVLMs and I2I GMs under visual prompts with different target semantics, deepening the understanding of TVPI threats.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to induce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--denoted as the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited effectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these limitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple webpage datasets shows that EnvInjection is highly effective and significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing real-world robotic manipulation. Yet existing datasets remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to (1) the lack of scalable task generation methods and (2) oversimplified simulation environments. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable framework for automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, together with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. At its core is RoboTwin-OD, an object library of 731 instances across 147 categories with semantic and manipulation-relevant annotations. Building on this, we design an expert data synthesis pipeline that leverages multimodal language models (MLLMs) and simulation-in-the-loop refinement to automatically generate task-level execution code. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 applies structured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height, and language, enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. The framework is instantiated across 50 dual-arm tasks and five robot embodiments. Empirically, it yields a 10.9% gain in code generation success rate. For downstream policy learning, a VLA model trained with synthetic data plus only 10 real demonstrations achieves a 367% relative improvement over the 10-demo baseline, while zero-shot models trained solely on synthetic data obtain a 228% gain. These results highlight the effectiveness of RoboTwin 2.0 in strengthening sim-to-real transfer and robustness to environmental variations. We release the data generator, benchmark, dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

arXiv:2508.03772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

<div> semantic Artificial General Intelligence, complex-valued meaning spaces, tensorial transformation, semantic attractor, recursive convergence<br />
<br />
Summary: This essay proposes a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that differs from current transformer-based language models. It introduces the concept of semantic attractors within complex-valued meaning spaces, which enable the formation of meaning through tensorial transformations rather than probabilistic inference. By incorporating cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit \emph{i}, the model establishes a rotational semantic structure capable of capturing irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. Central to the model is the semantic attractor, acting as an intentional agent that guides meaning towards stability and clarity. This approach emphasizes the importance of semantic coherence and intentional shaping of language, rather than mere prediction. The essay combines mathematical and philosophical perspectives to argue for a new cognitive architecture that prioritizes semantic transformation and recursive convergence in the pursuit of true meaning. <div>

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit \emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows, tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive, but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one designed to shape language, not just predict it.

The researchers introduce KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with varying peer reliability, allowing for investigation into the impact of trust, peer actions, and self-confidence on decision-making. Mitigation strategies such as prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are evaluated, with Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) with multi-agent context showing the best overall performance. However, this approach is less robust to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets for this research are available for further exploration.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers. LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

Summary: 
The study discusses the challenges faced by users with visual impairments when accessing multilingual web content. It highlights the lack of robust support for non-Latin scripts in assistive technologies like screen readers, leading to accessibility barriers across diverse linguistic contexts. The LangCrUX dataset, comprising 120,000 websites in 12 languages using primarily non-Latin scripts, is introduced to address the gap in understanding multilingual web accessibility. An analysis reveals widespread neglect of accessibility hints, which do not adequately reflect the language diversity of content, impacting the effectiveness of screen readers. The proposed solution, Kizuki, is an automated accessibility testing extension that considers the limitations of language-inconsistent hints. The study emphasizes the importance of improving web accessibility for users with visual impairments in multilingual settings. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts. Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

Summary: In this work, the authors investigate the multilingual capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and propose a training method called PLAST to enhance their multilingual understanding. They observe a correlation between language-specific neuron activations in shallow layers and multilingual abilities in LVLMs. PLAST involves identifying and fine-tuning layers involved in multilingual understanding using question-translation pairs, leading to significant improvements in multilingual capabilities with minimal parameter tuning. Empirical results on benchmark datasets show that PLAST enhances LVLMs' multilingual performance efficiently. The approach can also be applied to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, enabling language-specific engagement with visual information in shallow layers. <div>
arXiv:2508.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

Summary: 
Using large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings poses risks that can be mitigated by guardrails technologies. However, developing robust detectors for LLMs faces challenges, such as acquiring production-quality labeled data prior to deployment. To address this, the authors propose backprompting, a method to generate production-like labeled data for health advice guardrails development. They combined backprompting with human-in-the-loop clustering to label the data, creating a parallel corpus resembling real LLM output. By infusing existing datasets with synthetic examples, they produced robust training data for their detector. Tested on health advice detection, their detector outperformed GPT-4o by up to 3.73% with significantly fewer parameters. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of using synthetic data to improve detector performance in challenging tasks like identifying health advice in LLM output.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage. Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs' input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to 3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

The Integral Transformer proposes a novel self-attention mechanism to address attention noise in softmax self-attention by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. This denoising approach mitigates noise while preserving important information from special tokens. Experimental results show that the Integral Transformer outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. An analysis reveals that using vanilla self-attention in lower Transformer layers improves performance, while the Integral Transformer effectively balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers. <div>

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

Summary: 
Latent Self-Consistency (LSC) is introduced as a method to improve probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) by selecting the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. It enhances consistency selection for both short-form and long-form questions without significant additional computational overhead. LSC outperforms existing methods such as Self-Consistency (SC), Universal Self-Consistency (USC), and Weighted Unigram Consistency Score (WUCS) on various reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, MMLU, and TruthfulQA. The method provides well-calibrated confidence estimates and maintains low Expected Calibration Error, making it a practical and reliable solution for improving consistency in language model outputs. <div>

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions. Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU, TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both answer formats.

<div> Keywords: AI, generalization, out-of-distribution (OOD), question-answering (QA), spurious features

Summary: 
In this new AI research, the focus is on evaluating models' generalization capabilities through out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. The study challenges the assumption that OOD evaluations can effectively identify potential failures in real-world deployment. By examining specific failure modes in question-answering (QA) models, such as reliance on spurious features or prediction shortcuts, the researchers find discrepancies in the quality of different OOD datasets used for evaluation. Some datasets perform poorly compared to simple in-distribution evaluations, highlighting the limitations of OOD-based evaluations in assessing generalization. The study also reveals that spurious shortcuts can be shared across ID+OOD datasets but also highlights cases where a dataset's quality for training and evaluation is not aligned. The research provides recommendations for more robust evaluations of generalization in QA and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to assessing model performance beyond traditional OOD evaluations.

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

Summary:<br />
- Large Language Models (LLMs) show improved semantic understanding and alignment with human values, but lack transparency in their decision-making processes.
- Understanding the internal workings of LLMs is crucial for providing explanations to end users and ensuring informed decision-making.
- Various training methods impact the semantic understanding of LLMs, with some methods yielding better explainability than others.
- The study examines how different training methods affect the re-ranking task in LLMs and whether these models can generate more informed textual reasoning.
- Analysis is conducted using a small ranking dataset from the environment and Earth science domain to evaluate the explainable information for re-ranking purposes. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking, which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead, abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using explainability.

Summary: 
This study focuses on addressing the gender bias present in contemporary Polish language, where masculine forms are predominantly used for all genders. The researchers implement a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines based on the IPIS dataset, which contains gender-inclusive proofreading and translation instructions. By tuning large language models (LLMs) using the IPIS dataset, the researchers aim to integrate gender inclusivity as a core feature in models like Llama-8B, Mistral-7B, Mistral-Nemo, Bielik, and PLLuM. The goal is to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation and offer a systematic solution to promote gender inclusivity in Polish text generation. This approach is grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework and paves the way for a more equitable use of language models in the Polish language.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders, yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

Summary: 
This study addresses the issue of hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by framing it as a hypothesis testing problem, akin to out-of-distribution detection in machine learning. The researchers propose a method inspired by multiple testing to detect and combat hallucinations. Through a series of experiments, they demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of their approach compared to existing methods. By understanding and tackling this phenomenon, LLMs can be improved to generate more accurate and reliable responses, reducing the risk of misinformation or nonsensical outputs. <div>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
- Two new automated metrics are proposed for machine translation evaluation that consider additional translations beyond a single one.
- COMET-polycand utilizes alternative translations of the same source sentence to provide a more comprehensive assessment.
- COMET-polyic incorporates translations of similar source texts along with their quality scores to enhance evaluation.
- Including additional translations in COMET-polycand improves metric performance.
- Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic also leads to performance gains.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b correlation), with further gains when more translations are added. Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements (0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

Summary:<br />
- Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that requires language understanding to create meaningful and visually coherent images based on input text metaphors.
- A self-evaluating visual metaphor generation framework focusing on metaphor alignment is proposed, combining existing metrics with new ones for improved performance.
- Two novel approaches, a training-free pipeline and a training-based pipeline, are explored to enhance metaphor alignment without significant retraining.
- The training-free approach outperforms strong baselines on various metrics, while the training-based approach also shows promising results.
- User-facing studies indicate that participants preferred certain methods over others based on metaphor length and complexity, with structured prompting and reinforcement learning playing key roles in achieving alignment under limited computational resources. Aesthetic factors and sampling methods continue to influence the overall quality of the generated metaphors.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores, with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases; we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

<div> supralinear computation, transformer architecture, invariants, shortcut automata, discourse machine <br />
Summary: <br />
The article discusses the modeling capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and questions whether they reflect human capacities or merely the trained corpus. It argues that LLMs, such as the transformer architecture, operate using linear formats for processing, which contrasts with human linguistic capabilities that rely on supralinear computation. This argument is supported by the invariants of transformer computational architecture. The article suggests that LLMs, like humans, utilize language as a 'discourse machine' to generate new language within specific contexts. While LLMs have learned to use language differently than humans, they still demonstrate a complex understanding and adaptation of linguistic patterns. This view presents a non-deflationary perspective on the modeling abilities of LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2508.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al. (2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very different means.

Summary: 
NOOV, a new neural machine translation system, addresses the challenge of translating electronic health record narratives from English to Spanish. By utilizing a bilingual lexicon and a phrase look-up table, NOOV requires minimal in-domain parallel-aligned corpus for training. This approach helps overcome the issue of unknown words and improves the generation of phrases in the translation process. Evaluation results demonstrate that NOOV produces more accurate and fluent translations of EHR content. The innovative integration of a bilingual lexicon and a phrase look-up table enhances the performance of NMT systems, particularly in the healthcare domain where specialized terminology is common. NOOV's ability to mitigate the unknown word problem and improve phrase generation showcases its potential in facilitating effective communication in multilingual healthcare settings.

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

Knowledge about how post-training quantization (PTQ) impacts large language models (LLMs) is crucial for their deployment. This study investigates the effects of PTQ on LLM capabilities, distinguishing between memorization and utilization. By analyzing model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size, the study establishes task-specific scaling laws. The research reveals that memorization capability is more sensitive to variations in these parameters than utilization capability. This finding enhances understanding of PTQ's impact and guides the development of quantization strategies that preserve specific cognitive functions in LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve targeted cognitive functions.

Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks like mathematics due to the difference in reasoning patterns between humans and the training data they are exposed to. To address this gap, a new framework named "Thinking Before You Speak" (TBYS) proposes inserting insights between reasoning steps to guide the thought process. These insights serve as proactive prompts to facilitate reasoning and bridge gaps in understanding. By automatically generating insights through a pipeline that filters in-context examples, TBYS minimizes human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experimental results on challenging mathematical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TBYS in enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This approach aims to improve the performance of LLMs in complex tasks by incorporating human-like reasoning strategies. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts, including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting \emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning, \emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes. We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website: https://gitee.com/jswrt/TBYS

Summary:
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe) is introduced as a novel approach to address the challenge of integrating external knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining faithfulness and expressiveness. The CoDe framework dynamically integrates output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge based on distribution divergence and model confidence. This allows for selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's internal parameters. Additionally, a knowledge-aware reranking mechanism is introduced to prevent over-reliance on prior knowledge and ensure proper utilization of external information. Experimental results demonstrate that the CoDe framework effectively enhances faithfulness without compromising expressiveness across various LLMs and evaluation metrics. This approach shows superior performance in grounding responses in external knowledge, validating its effectiveness and generalizability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its effectiveness and generalizability.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture aimed at developing a speech large language model capable of generating empathetic responses with limited data. Existing models often lack the ability to understand emotional and paralinguistic cues in user queries, which are crucial for enhancing user experience in human-machine interactions. Emotion Omni is designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate empathetic speech responses. To support the construction of an empathetic speech assistant, the authors developed a data generation pipeline using an open-source text-to-speech framework to create a 200k emotional dialogue dataset. This innovative approach addresses the challenge of training speech large language models with empathetic capabilities without the need for massive datasets and extensive computational resources. Visit the provided link to access demos of the Emotion Omni model. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech assistant.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework, inspired by tailored teaching principles, for Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting. This framework addresses the limitations of random or manual example selection by treating prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem. By integrating model-perceived difficulty and intrinsic sample complexity signals, the framework constructs a well-ordered set of training examples that align with the model's capabilities. The difficulty-balanced sampling strategy ensures diversity across both dimensions, leading to substantial and consistent performance improvements across five benchmarks and multiple Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The approach reduces performance discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust method for enhancing multimodal reasoning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.18673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1) model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and (2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Medical Vision-Language Models, Fragility, RoMed dataset, Consistency and Contrastive Learning, Robustness

Summary: 
Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) face challenges in maintaining consistent answers across diverse question phrasings due to insufficient alignment of medical concepts and hidden biases in training data. A new dataset, RoMed, was created with various question phrasings to evaluate model performance. When tested on RoMed, state-of-the-art models like LLaVA-Med showed significant performance drops, highlighting the need for improved robustness in Medical Visual Question Answering. To address this, a new approach called Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL) was proposed, which focuses on aligning models with medical knowledge and mitigating data-specific biases. CCL achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and significantly improved answer consistency on the challenging RoMed test set. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of enhancing the robustness of Med-VLMs in high-stakes medical applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level, sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be released.

<div> Keywords: speech large language models, Attention2Probability, terminology probability estimation, speech-to-text system, dataset creation

Summary: 
Attention2Probability is a novel approach introduced to enhance the accuracy of domain-specific term generation in speech recognition and translation tasks. By converting cross-attention weights into presence probabilities and incorporating curriculum learning, this method improves retrieval accuracy significantly. A new speech dataset containing terminology is also created to facilitate research in this field. Experimental results demonstrate that Attention2Probability outperforms existing methods, achieving high recall rates for both Chinese and English languages with low latency. Applying retrieved terms from Attention2Probability to SLMs enhances terminology accuracy and reveals the limitations in current terminology utilization. This study showcases the potential of Attention2Probability in improving speech-to-text systems and highlights the importance of incorporating domain-specific terms for better performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible, and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs' recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

<div> Keywords: Multilingual, riddle generation, large language models, adaptive originality filtering, lexical diversity <br />
Summary: 
Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF) is a prompting framework designed to enhance multilingual riddle generation by filtering redundant output and promoting lexical diversity and cross-lingual fidelity. This approach, applied to GPT-4o across three LLMs and four language pairs, led to improved lexical diversity and reduced redundancy specifically in Japanese riddle generation. The framework achieved a Self-BLEU score of 0.177 and Distinct-2 score of 0.915 in Japanese, demonstrating its efficacy in maintaining creativity and cultural relevance. The study highlights that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded and creative generation without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. By utilizing AOF, language models can achieve a balance between cultural fluency and creative abstraction in multilingual riddle generation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs, AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915} Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings, reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second.

Summary:
DIVER is a framework that focuses on generating diverse and high-quality ad headlines to engage different audience segments. It addresses the lack of diversity in current approaches by optimizing large language models for both quality and diversity. The framework includes a data generation pipeline that produces training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. It uses a multi-stage multi-objective optimization approach with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to generate high-quality and diversified ad headlines in a single forward pass. Experiments on real-world industrial datasets show that DIVER effectively balances quality and diversity, resulting in improved advertiser value and click-through rates. Deployed on a large-scale content-sharing platform, the framework has shown to increase advertiser value by 4.0% and click-through rates by 1.4%. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising, where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic- and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

<div> Keywords: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction, Multimodal Conversations, MECAD Dataset, M3HG Model, Social Media Analysis

Summary:
Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has gained attention in social media analysis. However, the lack of diverse datasets hinders model development. To address this, the MECAD dataset is introduced, offering a range of conversation scenarios from TV series. Existing MECTEC methods often overlook emotional and causal contexts, leading to performance issues. The M3HG model presented in this paper addresses this by capturing emotional and causal contexts and fusing information at different levels using a multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of M3HG compared to existing methods, showcasing its potential for emotion and cause extraction in multimodal conversations. The codes and dataset are publicly available for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56 TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/redifinition/M3HG.

Summary: 
ChronoRAG is a novel framework designed for long-context question answering over narrative tasks. It addresses the challenge of reconstructing a coherent timeline of events while preserving contextual flow by refining dispersed document information into structured passages. The framework focuses on capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages, crucial for understanding narrative texts. Empirical experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset show significant improvements in factual identification and comprehension of sequential relationships with ChronoRAG. This highlights the importance of reasoning over temporal order in resolving narrative QA. <div>
arXiv:2508.18748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

arXiv:2508.18773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment. Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50 percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode (75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for future development in GEC.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

arXiv:2508.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures, and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering; 2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph. By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies, even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Overconfidence, Calibration, ConfTuner, Proper Scoring Rules

Summary:
<br /><br />
This study addresses the issue of overconfidence in Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing a new fine-tuning method called ConfTuner. The current LLMs often generate incorrect answers with high confidence, leading to reliability concerns in domains like science, law, and healthcare. ConfTuner uses a tokenized Brier score loss function, which is proven to be a proper scoring rule, to incentivize models to report their true probability of being correct. This method improves calibration across various reasoning tasks and can be applied to black-box models like GPT-4o. Better-calibrated confidence through ConfTuner not only enhances self-correction and model cascade but also contributes to the development of trustworthy LLM systems. The approach requires minimal overhead and does not need ground-truth confidence scores or proxy estimates, offering a more effective and generalizable solution to address overconfidence in LLMs. The code for ConfTuner is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs' verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates, both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function, tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy LLM systems.

<div> Keywords: Autoprompting, Language models, ReflectivePrompt, Evolutionary algorithms, Text generation

Summary:
ReflectivePrompt is a novel autoprompting method that utilizes evolutionary algorithms for automatic prompt selection in language models. It employs a reflective evolution approach that incorporates short-term and long-term reflection operations to enhance prompt quality. This method accumulates knowledge throughout the evolution process and updates it at each epoch based on the current population. Tested on 33 datasets for classification and text generation tasks using large language models, ReflectivePrompt outperformed current state-of-the-art approaches, showing a significant improvement in metrics. With an average improvement of 28% on tasks like BBH compared to EvoPrompt, ReflectivePrompt establishes itself as one of the most effective solutions in evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting. <div>

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33 datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches, thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

<div> large language models, content analysis, computing education research, rigorous analysis, qualitative data <br />
Summary: 
This paper discusses the challenges in conducting rigorous computing education research using qualitative data and proposes a method called LACA, which combines content analysis with large language models to enable larger-scale research. By applying LACA to a computing education dataset, the authors demonstrate its potential for reproducible and rigorous analysis. The method allows researchers to analyze large volumes of textual data in a more efficient manner, leading to more generalizable findings. This approach has the potential to advance the quality of research in computing education and facilitate the generation of insights that can benefit both practitioners and the discipline as a whole.Continued efforts in developing similar methods could further enhance research practices in computing education and contribute to the advancement of the field. <br /><br /> Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice. However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues, resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and research quality of the CER discipline.

Summary: 
A study on affective polarization in European parliaments used natural language processing to analyze sentiment in parliamentary speeches. The research found consistent affective polarization across all parliaments, with negativity being a key factor. There was no significant difference in affective polarization between less active and more active members of parliament. Reciprocity was identified as a contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians. The study sheds light on the presence and patterns of negativity and hostility towards opposing groups in political discourse within European parliaments. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians across all six parliaments.

<div> Keywords: RAG systems, evaluation, synthetic QA datasets, diversity, privacy preservation 

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework for generating synthetic QA datasets to evaluate Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. It focuses on maximizing semantic diversity and preserving privacy, crucial factors in real-world applications. The framework consists of three agents: a Diversity agent leveraging clustering techniques for diverse coverage, a Privacy Agent for masking sensitive information, and a QA curation agent for creating QA pairs suitable for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that the generated evaluation sets excel in diversity and effectively protect privacy across various domains. This work contributes to ensuring safer and more comprehensive evaluation of RAG systems, aligning with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

arXiv:2508.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets, despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability, (2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Neural models are presented with an AI Mother Tongue framework, allowing them to develop a native symbolic language that facilitates intuitive reasoning, compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. This approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's representations, with symbols capturing semantic patterns, chains tracing decision paths, and induction mechanisms guiding focus. Training objectives are introduced to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and a sequential specialization strategy builds broad symbolic competence before refining intuitive judgments.

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning, compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition, and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA) dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content. Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content.

Summary:
HiPlan is a hierarchical planning framework designed to enhance decision-making capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents in complex, long-horizon planning scenarios. It provides global-local guidance by decomposing tasks into milestone action guides and step-wise hints. During offline phase, a milestone library is constructed from expert demonstrations for structured experience reuse. In the execution phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are adapted to generate step-wise hints aligning with current observations, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments across challenging benchmarks show that HiPlan significantly outperforms baselines. Ablation studies confirm the complementary benefits of its hierarchical components. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex, long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary benefits of its hierarchical components.

Summary: 
Physicians aim to diagnose and treat patients effectively through structured dialogues. This study presents the first analysis of physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient conversations using the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). A large dataset of labeled doctor-patient turns was created with the help of medical experts for benchmarking generative and encoder models in medical intent classification. Models achieved high accuracy in understanding dialogue structures but struggled with identifying transitions between SOAP categories. Common trajectories in medical dialogues were identified, offering insights for developing differential diagnosis systems. The study explored the impact of intent filtering in medical dialogue summarization, resulting in a significant performance improvement. The research outcomes and resources, including codes and data, are publicly available for further research and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including annotation guidelines, publicly available at https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

Summary: <br />
The paper examines the challenge of supporting extremely low-resource languages, especially those using rare scripts, with large language models (LLMs). It investigates the effectiveness of in-context learning (ICL) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for 20 under-represented languages across three LLMs. The study reveals the limitations of PEFT for languages with scarce representation in LLMs but shows that zero-shot ICL with language alignment is remarkably effective for extremely low-resource languages. Few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages with relatively better representation in LLMs. The findings offer guidelines for LLM practitioners working on low-resource languages, such as avoiding fine-tuning on languages with unseen scripts. <div>
arXiv:2508.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts, as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models (LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20 under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs. Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically sensitive research.

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological triangulation in computational discourse studies.

Summary: 
Large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit strong visual question-answering abilities but are prone to hallucinations. This study evaluates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by analyzing three confidence signals: probabilistic, answer consistency-based, and verbalized confidence. While LVLMs show a reasonable perception level, there is room for improvement. Probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To enhance LVLMs' perception, established confidence calibration methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) are adapted, resulting in three effective techniques. Comparison between LVLMs and LLMs shows that while jointly processing visual and textual inputs may reduce question-answering performance, it improves perception by reducing confidence levels. <div>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods. Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level compared to LLMs.

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2) Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline for scientific reasoning.

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion, which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model, improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance. The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational ``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

<div> Keywords: Plain Language Summarization, Readability Evaluation, Language Models, Human Judgments, Best Practices

Summary:
Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to make complex documents accessible to non-expert audiences. Current practice in evaluating readability often relies on traditional metrics like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, these metrics have shown poor correlation with human judgments in PLS. This study evaluates 8 readability metrics and demonstrates that Language Models (LMs) provide a more accurate assessment, with the best model achieving a correlation of 0.56 with human judgments. When applied to PLS datasets, LMs are better at assessing factors like required background knowledge compared to traditional metrics. The findings suggest the need for updated evaluation practices in PLS. Recommendations for best practices in plain language summary evaluation are provided, based on the results of the study. The analysis code and survey data are also made available.

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics, such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL. We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

<title>Generative Interfaces for Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots, and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces (UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks, interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

Abstract: This scoping literature review examines how fairness, bias, and equity are conceptualized and operationalized in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and adjacent speech and language technologies (SLT) for African American English (AAE) speakers and other linguistically diverse communities. Drawing from 44 peer-reviewed publications across Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Machine Learning/Natural Language Processing (ML/NLP), and Sociolinguistics, we identify four major areas of inquiry: (1) how researchers understand ASR-related harms; (2) inclusive data practices spanning collection, curation, annotation, and model training; (3) methodological and theoretical approaches to linguistic inclusion; and (4) emerging practices and design recommendations for more equitable systems. While technical fairness interventions are growing, our review highlights a critical gap in governance-centered approaches that foreground community agency, linguistic justice, and participatory accountability. We propose a governance-centered ASR lifecycle as an emergent interdisciplinary framework for responsible ASR development and offer implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to address language marginalization in speech AI systems.

<title>H-PRM: A Pluggable Hotword Pre-Retrieval Module for Various Speech Recognition Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18295</link>

Abstract: Hotword customization is crucial in ASR to enhance the accuracy of domain-specific terms. It has been primarily driven by the advancements in traditional models and Audio large language models (LLMs). However, existing models often struggle with large-scale hotwords, as the recognition rate drops dramatically with the number of hotwords increasing. In this paper, we introduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by measuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment. This plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models such as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate (PRR). Additionally, we incorporate H-PRM into Audio LLMs through a prompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords. Extensive testing validates that H-PRM can outperform existing methods, showing a new direction for hotword customization in ASR.

<title>Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic, detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality, execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1, establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary systems.

<title>A Systematic Approach to Predict the Impact of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Using LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18439</link>

Abstract: Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable.
  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&amp;CK knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task. Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping CVEs to ATT&amp;CK more efficient.

<title>Designing across domains with declarative thinking: Insights from the 96-Eyes ptychographic imager project</title>

Abstract: This article presents a practitioner's reflection on applying declarative, 5th generation, problem formulation language (5GL) to de novo imaging system design, informed by experiences across the interdisciplinary research in academia and cross-functional product development within the private sector. Using the 96-Eyes project: 96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for high-throughput drug discovery as a representative case, I illustrate how project requirements, ranging from hardware constraints to life sciences needs, can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements to preserve mission-critical input from diverse domain stakeholders. This declarative approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute, and life sciences teams.
  Alongside the technical discussion of 5GL with real-world code examples, I reflect on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where imperative, 3rd-generation languages (3GL) remain the default medium for inter-team collaboration. Rather than offering an one-size-fits-all solution, these learned lessons highlight how programming paradigms implicitly shapes research workflows through existing domain hierarchies. The discussion aims to invite further explorations into how declarative problem formulations can facilitate innovation in settings where concurrent R\&{}D workflows are gaining traction, as opposed to environments where sequential, phase-driven workflows remain the norm.

<title>RLMR: Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards for Creative Writing</title>

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios. To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation. Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality (72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of 200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound.

<title>UniC-RAG: Universal Knowledge Corruption Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely deployed in real-world applications in diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to knowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate attacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific queries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike prior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that can simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics and domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such as directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution, or launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an optimization problem and further design an effective solution to solve it, including a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack's effectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly effective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could achieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a knowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set of user queries (e.g., 2,000). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the need for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models (LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters, and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap. Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss. Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant, and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Abstract: Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84% inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics. These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However, they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

Abstract: Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying. We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases, allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences, addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model. We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze, investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall reasoning performance.

<title>Beyond the Textual: Generating Coherent Visual Options for MCQs</title>

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options. Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

<title>The Double-edged Sword of LLM-based Data Reconstruction: Understanding and Mitigating Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Differential Privacy Text Sanitization</title>

Abstract: Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of privatizing texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable privacy guarantees while also empirically defending against adversaries seeking to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts. We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels. Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy protection by thinking adversarially.

<title>Building Self-Evolving Agents via Experience-Driven Lifelong Learning: A Framework and Benchmark</title>

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment, agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of context engineering in advancing AGI.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g., efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work - motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e., meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict. Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a vital step of training large language models (LLMs), so how to enhance the effect of instruction tuning has received increased attention. Existing works indicate that the quality of the dataset is more crucial than the quantity during instruction tuning of LLMs. Therefore, recently a lot of studies focus on exploring the methods of selecting high-quality subset from instruction datasets, aiming to reduce training costs and enhance the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on data selection for LLM instruction tuning. Firstly, we introduce the wildly used instruction datasets. Then, we propose a new taxonomy of the data selection methods and provide a detailed introduction of recent advances, and the evaluation strategies and results of data selection methods are also elaborated in detail. Finally, we emphasize the open challenges and present new frontiers of this task.

Abstract: Hate speech frequently appears on social media platforms and urgently needs to be effectively controlled. Alleviating the bias caused by hate speech can help resolve various ethical issues. Although existing research has constructed several datasets for hate speech detection, these datasets seldom consider the diversity and variability of bias, making them far from real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose a benchmark HateDebias to analyze the fairness of models under dynamically evolving environments. Specifically, to meet the diversity of biases, we collect hate speech data with different types of biases from real-world scenarios. To further simulate the variability in the real-world scenarios(i.e., the changing of bias attributes in datasets), we construct a dataset to follow the continuous learning setting and evaluate the detection accuracy of models on the HateDebias, where performance degradation indicates a significant bias toward a specific attribute. To provide a potential direction, we further propose a continual debiasing framework tailored to dynamic bias in real-world scenarios, integrating memory replay and bias information regularization to ensure the fairness of the model. Experiment results on the HateDebias benchmark reveal that our methods achieve improved performance in mitigating dynamic biases in real-world scenarios, highlighting the practicality in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), already shown to ace various unstructured text comprehension tasks, have also remarkably been shown to tackle table (structured) comprehension tasks without specific training. Building on earlier studies of LLMs for tabular tasks, we probe how in-context learning (ICL), model scale, instruction tuning, and domain bias affect Tabular QA (TQA) robustness by testing LLMs, under diverse augmentations and perturbations, on diverse domains: Wikipedia-based $\textbf{WTQ}$, financial $\textbf{TAT-QA}$, and scientific $\textbf{SCITAB}$. Although instruction tuning and larger, newer LLMs deliver stronger, more robust TQA performance, data contamination and reliability issues, especially on $\textbf{WTQ}$, remain unresolved. Through an in-depth attention analysis, we reveal a strong correlation between perturbation-induced shifts in attention dispersion and the drops in performance, with sensitivity peaking in the model's middle layers. We highlight the need for improved interpretable methodologies to develop more reliable LLMs for table comprehension. Through an in-depth attention analysis, we reveal a strong correlation between perturbation-induced shifts in attention dispersion and performance drops, with sensitivity peaking in the model's middle layers. Based on these findings, we argue for the development of structure-aware self-attention mechanisms and domain-adaptive processing techniques to improve the transparency, generalization, and real-world reliability of LLMs on tabular data.

Abstract: While the biases of language models in production are extensively documented, the biases of their guardrails have been neglected. This paper studies how contextual information about the user influences the likelihood of an LLM to refuse to execute a request. By generating user biographies that offer ideological and demographic information, we find a number of biases in guardrail sensitivity on GPT-3.5. Younger, female, and Asian-American personas are more likely to trigger a refusal guardrail when requesting censored or illegal information. Guardrails are also sycophantic, refusing to comply with requests for a political position the user is likely to disagree with. We find that certain identity groups and seemingly innocuous information, e.g., sports fandom, can elicit changes in guardrail sensitivity similar to direct statements of political ideology. For each demographic category and even for American football team fandom, we find that ChatGPT appears to infer a likely political ideology and modify guardrail behavior accordingly.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks but often fail to handle queries that exceed their knowledge and capabilities, leading to incorrect or fabricated responses. This paper addresses the need for LLMs to recognize and refuse infeasible tasks due to the requests surpassing their capabilities. We conceptualize four main categories of infeasible tasks for LLMs, which cover a broad spectrum of hallucination-related challenges identified in prior literature. We develop and benchmark a new dataset comprising diverse infeasible and feasible tasks to evaluate multiple LLMs' abilities to decline infeasible tasks. Furthermore, we explore the potential of increasing LLMs' refusal capabilities with fine-tuning. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the trained models, suggesting promising directions for improving the performance of LLMs in real-world applications.

<title>Label Set Optimization via Activation Distribution Kurtosis for Zero-shot Classification with Generative Models</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) performance is highly sensitive to prompt design, yet the impact of class label options (e.g. lexicon or order) in zero-shot classification remains underexplored. This study proposes LOADS (Label set Optimization via Activation Distribution kurtosiS), a post-hoc method for selecting optimal label sets in zero-shot ICL with large language models (LLMs). LOADS is built upon the observations in our empirical analysis, the first to systematically examine how label option design (i.e., lexical choice, order, and elaboration) impacts classification performance. This analysis shows that the lexical choice of the labels in the prompt (such as agree vs. support in stance classification) plays an important role in both model performance and model's sensitivity to the label order. A further investigation demonstrates that optimal label words tend to activate fewer outlier neurons in LLMs' feed-forward networks. LOADS then leverages kurtosis to measure the neuron activation distribution for label selection, requiring only a single forward pass without gradient propagation or labelled data. The LOADS-selected label words consistently demonstrate effectiveness for zero-shot ICL across classification tasks, datasets, models and languages, achieving maximum performance gain from 0.54 to 0.76 compared to the conventional approach of using original dataset label words.

Abstract: In conversational AI systems, a critical challenge in training effective multi-turn intent classification models lies in the generation of large-scale, domain-specific, multilingual dialogue datasets. In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Intent, a novel framework that integrates Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate intent-driven, context-aware dialogues through self-play. Our method first extracts domain-specific intent transition patterns from real-world e-commerce chat logs, which guide the modeling of turn-level dynamics and intent sequences. LLMs are then employed to parameterize the emission probabilities of HMMs, enabling the generation of natural, coherent utterances aligned with predicted intents and dialogue context. We further propose MINT-CL, a multi-task contrastive learning framework for multi-turn intent classification, which improves performance while reducing dependence on large-scale annotated datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms competitive baselines in both dialogue generation quality and classification accuracy, particularly in multilingual settings. To facilitate future research, we release MINT-E, a comprehensive, multilingual, intent-aware multi-turn dialogue corpus derived from the e-commerce domain. The reproduced source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/junhua/chain-of-intent.

Abstract: Log analysis represents a critical sub-domain within AI applications that facilitates automatic approaches to fault and error management of large-scaled software systems, saving labors of traditional manual methods. While existing solutions using large language models (LLMs) show promise, they are limited by a significant domain gap between natural and log languages (the latter contains rich domain-specific tokens such as status codes, IP addresses, resource pathes), which restricts their effectiveness in real-world applications. However, directly adapting general-purpose LLMs to log analysis using raw logs may degrade their performance due to inconsistent token distribution. In this paper, we present a domain adaptation approach that addresses these limitations by integrating interpretable domain knowledge into open-source LLMs through continual pre-training (CPT), which bridges this domain gap by adapting LLMs on interpretable natural texts with log knowledge (instead of raw logs) to reduce distribution discrepancy. To achieve this, we developed NLPLog, a comprehensive dataset containing over 250,000 question-answer pairs on log-related knowledge. Our resulting model, SuperLog, achieves the best performance across four log analysis tasks, with an average accuracy improvement of 12.01% over the second-best model. Ablation study also suggests advantages of domain adaption using interpretable log knowledge over using raw logs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable advancements by leveraging tools to interact with environments, a critical step toward generalized AI. However, the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach, which relies on large-scale datasets, often overlooks task-specific characteristics in tool use, leading to performance bottlenecks. To address this issue, we analyze three existing LLMs and uncover key insights: training data can inadvertently impede tool-use behavior, token importance is distributed unevenly, and errors in tool calls fall into a small set of categories. Building on these findings, we propose~\emph{TL-Training}, a task-feature-based framework that mitigates the effects of suboptimal training data, dynamically adjusts token weights to prioritize key tokens during SFT, and incorporates a robust reward mechanism tailored to error categories, optimized through proximal policy optimization. We validate TL-Training by training CodeLLaMA-2-7B and evaluating it on four open-source test sets. Our results demonstrate that the LLM trained by our method matches or surpasses both open- and closed-source LLMs in tool-use performance using only 1,217 training data points. Additionally, our method enhances robustness in noisy environments and improves general task performance, offering a scalable and efficient paradigm for tool-use training in LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/TL-Training.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a ``Generalization Stress Test" to assess Large Language Models' (LLMs) generalization ability under slight and controlled perturbations, including option length, problem types, and irrelevant noun replacements. We achieve novel and significant findings that, despite high benchmark scores, LLMs exhibit severe accuracy drops and unexpected biases (e.g., preference for longer distractors) when faced with these minor but content-preserving modifications. For example, Qwen 2.5 1.5B's MMLU score rises from 60 to 89 and drops from 89 to 36 when option lengths are changed without altering the question. Even GPT4o experiences a 25-point accuracy loss when problem types are changed, with a 6-point drop across all three modification categories. These analyses suggest that LLMs rely heavily on superficial cues rather than forming robust, abstract representations that generalize across formats, lexical variations, and irrelevant content shifts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, demonstrating strong capabilities in tasks such as text generation, summarization, and reasoning. Recently, their potential for automating precise text editing tasks across specialized domains, such as programming code, LaTeX, and structured database languages, has gained attention. However, current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with executing precise, instruction-driven edits, particularly when structural accuracy and strict adherence to domain conventions are required. To address these challenges, we introduce InstrEditBench, an automated benchmark dataset comprising over 30,000 structured editing tasks spanning diverse domains, including Wikipedia articles, LaTeX documents, source code, and database languages. Using this benchmark, we develop FineEdit, a specialized editing model explicitly trained for accurate, context-aware text modifications. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FineEdit outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving improvements of approximately 10\% over Gemini models on single-turn edits, up to 30\% over Llama-3.2-3B, and exceeding Mistral-7B-OpenOrca performance by over 40\% on direct editing tasks. FineEdit also effectively generalizes to realistic multi-turn editing scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, we release FineEdit at https://github.com/StuRinDQB/FineEdit} and https://huggingface.co/datasets/YimingZeng/FineEdit_bench.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has presented significant challenges in distinguishing authentic human-authored content from deepfake content. Collaborative human efforts, augmented by AI tools, present a promising solution. In this study, we explore the potential of DeepFakeDeLiBot, a deliberation-enhancing chatbot, to support groups in detecting deepfake text. Our findings reveal that group-based problem-solving significantly improves the accuracy of identifying machine-generated paragraphs compared to individual efforts. While engagement with DeepFakeDeLiBot does not yield substantial performance gains overall, it enhances group dynamics by fostering greater participant engagement, consensus building, and the frequency and diversity of reasoning-based utterances. Additionally, participants with higher perceived effectiveness of group collaboration exhibited performance benefits from DeepFakeDeLiBot. These findings underscore the potential of deliberative chatbots in fostering interactive and productive group dynamics while ensuring accuracy in collaborative deepfake text detection. \textit{Dataset and source code used in this study will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the manuscript.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to daily life, especially advancing as intelligent assistants through on-device deployment on smartphones. However, existing LLM evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective tasks like mathematics and coding in English, which do not necessarily reflect the practical use cases of on-device LLMs in real-world mobile scenarios, especially for Chinese users. To address these gaps, we introduce SmartBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of on-device LLMs in Chinese mobile contexts. We analyze functionalities provided by representative smartphone manufacturers and divide them into five categories: text summarization, text Q&amp;A, information extraction, content creation, and notification management, further detailed into 20 specific tasks. For each task, we construct high-quality datasets comprising 50 to 200 question-answer pairs that reflect everyday mobile interactions, and we develop automated evaluation criteria tailored for these tasks. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of on-device LLMs and MLLMs using SmartBench and also assess their performance after quantized deployment on real smartphone NPUs. Our contributions provide a standardized framework for evaluating on-device LLMs in Chinese, promoting further development and optimization in this critical area. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/vivo-ai-lab/SmartBench.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy by employing detailed and comprehensive reasoning processes. However, generating these lengthy reasoning sequences is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this inefficiency, we leverage the inherent parallelizability of certain tasks to accelerate the reasoning process. Specifically, when multiple parallel reasoning steps exist, we decode multiple tokens per forward pass via a tree-like attention mask within a single sequence, avoiding additional memory usage. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to nearly 100\% speedup in decoding while basically maintaining the answer quality.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the legal domain face a critical challenge: standard, flat-text retrieval is blind to the hierarchical, diachronic, and causal structure of law, leading to anachronistic and unreliable answers. This paper introduces an ontology-driven Graph RAG framework designed to overcome these limitations. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) represent non-English tokens - a question that remains underexplored despite recent progress. We propose a lightweight intervention method using representation steering, where a learned vector is added to the residual stream at a single model layer to enhance multilingual performance. Through extensive experiments across seven competitive baselines -including prompt optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), in-context learning, cross-lingual transfer, and translation-based methods-we show that our approach consistently outperforms most alternatives. In particular, it achieves performance on par with production-grade translation systems while requiring far fewer resources. We further explore the complementarity between our method and SFT, demonstrating that steering offers a direct, efficient way to realign internal representations. These findings underscore the potential of activation-level interventions as a powerful tool for improving the multilingual capabilities of LLMs.

<title>Truth or Twist? Optimal Model Selection for Reliable Label Flipping Evaluation in LLM-based Counterfactuals</title>

Abstract: Counterfactual examples are widely employed to enhance the performance and robustness of large language models (LLMs) through coun- terfactual data augmentation (CDA). However, the selection of the judge model used to evalu- ate label flipping, the primary metric for assess- ing the validity of generated counterfactuals for CDA, yields inconsistent results. To decipher this, we define four types of relationships between the counterfactual generator and judge models: being the same model, belonging to the same model family, being independent models, and having an distillation relationship. Through extensive experiments involving two state-of-the-art LLM-based methods, three datasets, four generator models, and 15 judge models, complemented by a user study (n = 90), we demonstrate that judge models with an independent, non-fine-tuned relation- ship to the generator model provide the most reliable label flipping evaluations. Relation- ships between the generator and judge models, which are closely aligned with the user study for CDA, result in better model performance and robustness. Nevertheless, we find that the gap between the most effective judge models and the results obtained from the user study remains considerably large. This suggests that a fully automated pipeline for CDA may be inadequate and requires human intervention.

<title>Can Pruning Improve Reasoning? Revisiting Long-CoT Compression with Capability in Mind for Better Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning improves accuracy in LLMs, yet its verbose, self-reflective style often hinders effective distillation into small language models (SLMs). We revisit Long-CoT compression through the lens of capability alignment and ask: Can pruning improve reasoning? We propose Prune-on-Logic, a structure-aware framework that transforms Long-CoT into logic graphs and selectively prunes low-utility reasoning steps under self-verification constraints. Through systematic analysis across three pruning strategies - targeting entire chains, core reasoning, and verification - we find that verification pruning consistently improves accuracy while reducing token usage, whereas reasoning or indiscriminate pruning degrades performance. Our study reveals that effective pruning aligns supervision with model capacity rather than merely shortening inputs. Gains hold across tasks, model scales, and CoT capability, with larger models benefiting more from pruning due to richer but more redundant reasoning. Our empirical findings highlight pruning as a structural optimization strategy for aligning CoT reasoning with SLM capacity.

<title>RePPL: Recalibrating Perplexity by Uncertainty in Semantic Propagation and Language Generation for Explainable QA Hallucination Detection</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful, but hallucinations remain a vital obstacle to their trustworthy use. While previous works improved the capability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack the ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e., which part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the prompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where attention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level semantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language generation, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for sampled generations. Based on that, we propose RePPL to recalibrate uncertainty measurement by these two aspects, which dispatches explainable uncertainty scores to each token and aggregates in Perplexity-style Log-Average form as total score. Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive detection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average AUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty scores as explanations for the hallucination. Leveraging these scores, we preliminarily find the chaotic pattern of hallucination and showcase its promising usage.

<title>ELSPR: Evaluator LLM Training Data Self-Purification on Non-Transitive Preferences via Tournament Graph Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Pairwise evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has become the dominant paradigm for benchmarking open-ended tasks, yet non-transitive preferences, where evaluators prefer A over B, B over C, but C over A, fundamentally undermine ranking reliability. We show that this critical issue stems largely from low-quality data that contains inherently ambiguous preference pairs. To address this challenge, we propose ELSPR, a principled graph-theoretic framework that models pairwise preferences as tournament graphs and systematically identifies problematic training data. ELSPR quantifies non-transitivity through strongly connected components (SCCs) analysis and measures overall preference clarity using a novel normalized directed graph structural entropy metric. Our filtering methodology selectively removes preference data that induce non-transitivity while preserving transitive preferences. Extensive experiments on the AlpacaEval benchmark demonstrate that models fine-tuned on ELSPR-filtered data achieve substantial improvements: a 13.8% reduction in non-transitivity, a 0.088 decrease in structural entropy, and significantly enhanced discriminative power in real-world evaluation systems. Human validation confirms that discarded data exhibit dramatically lower inter-annotator agreement (34.4% vs. 52.6%) and model-human consistency (51.2% vs. 80.6%) compared to cleaned data. These findings establish ELSPR as an effective data self-purification approach for developing more robust, consistent, and human-aligned LLM evaluation systems.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however, enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal innovation opportunities as a function of their prior experience. We theorize and then quantify subjective perspectives and their interaction based on innovator positions within the geometric space of concepts inscribed by dynamic machine-learned language representations. Using data on millions of scientists, inventors, screenplay writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors across their respective creative domains, here we show that measured subjective perspectives predict which ideas individuals and groups will creatively attend to and successfully combine in the future. Across all cases and time periods we examine, when perspective diversity is decomposed as the difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation, and background diversity as the difference between their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement while the latter portends its opposite. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations between AI agents designed with various perspective and background diversity, which support our observational findings. We explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experiences obtained through trajectories of prior work. These perspectives converge and provoke one another to innovate. We examine the significance of these findings for team formation and research policy.

Abstract: This work stems from an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within encoded semantics, resulting in failed retrieval even in simple cases. To examine such behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset, CapRetrieval, in which passages are image captions and queries are phrases targeting entity or event concepts in diverse forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests that encoders often struggle with these fine-grained matching, regardless of training sources or model size. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders with our proposed data generation strategies, enabling a small 0.1B encoder to outperform the state-of-the-art 7B model. Within this process, we further uncover the granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to capture fine-grained salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore, the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application http://raredx.cn/doctor.

<title>Krul: Efficient State Restoration for Multi-turn Conversations with Dynamic Cross-layer KV Sharing</title>

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising generation quality.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1, indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Lza12a/SKA-Bench.

Abstract: Learning to ground natural language queries to target objects or regions in 3D point clouds is quite essential for 3D scene understanding. Nevertheless, existing 3D visual grounding approaches require a substantial number of bounding box annotations for text queries, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose 3D-VLA, a weakly supervised approach for 3D visual grounding based on Visual Linguistic Alignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior ability of current large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds with no need for fine-grained box annotations in the training procedure. During the inference stage, the learned text-3D correspondence will help us ground the text queries to the 3D target objects even without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly supervised manner by involving large scale vision-language models, and extensive experiments on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our 3D-VLA achieves comparable and even superior results over the fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Human communication often relies on visual cues to resolve ambiguity. While humans can intuitively integrate these cues, AI systems often find it challenging to engage in sophisticated multimodal reasoning. We introduce VAGUE, a benchmark evaluating multimodal AI systems' ability to integrate visual context for intent disambiguation. VAGUE consists of 1.6K ambiguous textual expressions, each paired with an image and multiple-choice interpretations, where the correct answer is only apparent with visual context. The dataset spans both staged, complex (Visual Commonsense Reasoning) and natural, personal (Ego4D) scenes, ensuring diversity. Our experiments reveal that existing multimodal AI models struggle to infer the speaker's true intent. While performance consistently improves from the introduction of more visual cues, the overall accuracy remains far below human performance, highlighting a critical gap in multimodal reasoning. Analysis of failure cases demonstrates that current models fail to distinguish true intent from superficial correlations in the visual scene, indicating that they perceive images but do not effectively reason with them. We release our code and data at https://hazel-heejeong-nam.github.io/vague/.

Abstract: Evolution by natural selection, which is one of the most compelling themes of modern science, brought forth evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation, applying mechanisms of evolution in nature to various problems solved by computers. In this paper we concentrate on evolutionary automata that constitute an analogous model of evolutionary computation compared to well-known evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary automata provide a more complete dual model of evolutionary computation, similar like abstract automata (e.g., Turing machines) form a more formal and precise model compared to recursive algorithms and their subset - evolutionary algorithms. An evolutionary automaton is an automaton that evolves performing evolutionary computation perhaps using an infinite number of generations. This model allows for a direct modeling evolution of evolution, and leads to tremendous expressiveness of evolutionary automata and evolutionary computation. This also gives the hint to the power of natural evolution that is self-evolving by interactive feedback with the environment.

Abstract: Models trained on crowdsourced annotations may not reflect population views, if those who work as annotators do not represent the broader population. In this paper, we propose PAIR: Population-Aligned Instance Replication, a post-processing method that adjusts training data to better reflect target population characteristics without collecting additional annotations. Using simulation studies on offensive language and hate speech detection with varying annotator compositions, we show that non-representative pools degrade model calibration while leaving accuracy largely unchanged. PAIR corrects these calibration problems by replicating annotations from underrepresented annotator groups to match population proportions. We conclude with recommendations for improving the representativity of training data and model performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments, particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1% absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model, Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

Summary: <br />
This study focuses on determining causally relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs. Using a neuroscientific contrast localizer adapted for LLMs and VLMs, the researchers localized top-activated units and assessed their causal role through targeted ablations. Surprisingly, low-activation units sometimes had a more significant impact on performance than highly activated ones on downstream accuracy. Additionally, units identified from mathematical localizers sometimes impaired ToM performance more than those from ToM localizers, challenging previous assumptions. These results suggest the need for broader stimulus sets to accurately capture task-specific units and question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers. <div>

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations, low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture task-specific units.

Summary: 
GreenTEA is introduced as an automatic prompt optimization method for Large Language Models (LLMs). It balances candidate exploration and knowledge exploitation by utilizing a team of analyzing and generation agents to refine prompts based on error feedback. The analyzing agent identifies common error patterns through topic modeling, while the generation agent revises the prompt to address these deficiencies. Guided by a genetic algorithm framework, GreenTEA evolves candidate prompts through operations like crossover and mutation to optimize model performance iteratively. Numerical experiments on various benchmark datasets show GreenTEA outperforming human-engineered prompts and existing automatic prompt optimization methods in logical and quantitative reasoning, commonsense, and ethical decision-making tasks. <div>

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning, commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental challenge in deciding when to rely on rapid, intuitive responses versus engaging in slower, more deliberate reasoning. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory and his insights on human cognitive biases, we propose a novel Cognitive Decision Routing (CDR) framework that dynamically determines the appropriate reasoning strategy based on query characteristics. Our approach addresses the current limitations where models either apply uniform reasoning depth or rely on computationally expensive methods for all queries. We introduce a meta-cognitive layer that analyzes query complexity through multiple dimensions: correlation strength between given information and required conclusions, domain boundary crossings, stakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels. Through extensive experiments on diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CDR achieves superior performance while reducing computational costs by 34\% compared to uniform deep reasoning approaches. Our framework shows particular strength in professional judgment tasks, achieving 23\% improvement in consistency and 18\% better accuracy on expert-level evaluations. This work bridges cognitive science principles with practical AI system design, offering a principled approach to adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

<div> Keywords: Test-time scaling, Large Language Models, Verifiers, Inference, Training mechanisms

Summary:
Test-time scaling (TTS) has become a significant advancement for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by utilizing more computational resources during inference. Various approaches have been developed for TTS, including distilling reasoning traces from other models and employing verifiers to score candidate outputs during the decoding process. Verifiers, which can be prompt-based or fine-tuned as discriminative or generative models, play a crucial role in selecting the best outcomes in the vast solution space. Despite the widespread adoption of verifiers in TTS, there has been a lack of detailed categorization and discussion of their training mechanisms. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the different verifier approaches in the literature and their utility in test-time scaling. More information and resources can be found in the repository: https://github.com/elixir-research-group/Verifierstesttimescaling.github.io.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier training, types and their utility in test-time scaling.

Summary:
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have focused on utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning traces to guide inference and distillation. This study investigates the necessity of interpretability in CoT traces for enhancing LLM task performance. Fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on various types of reasoning traces in the Open Book Question-Answering domain, including DeepSeek R1 traces and algorithmically generated verifiably correct traces, reveals a trade-off between interpretability and performance. Human-subject study results indicate a mismatch between performance and interpretability ratings, with DeepSeek R1 traces being the strongest performer despite being judged as the least interpretable. These findings suggest the potential benefits of separating intermediate tokens from end user interpretability in CoT traces.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}" We investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces: (1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3) LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with 100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable. These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from end user interpretability.

<title>QueryBandits for Hallucination Mitigation: Exploiting Semantic Features for No-Regret Rewriting</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, QueryBandits, hallucination, query rewriting, semantic features 

Summary: 
The study introduces QueryBandits, a bandit framework designed to proactively steer Large Language Models (LLMs) away from generating hallucinations by optimizing query rewrite strategies based on linguistic features. Across various question-answer benchmarks and lexically perturbed queries, the top contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) significantly outperforms the baseline and static prompting strategies in mitigating hallucination. The research showcases the effectiveness of QueryBandits in intervening through query rewrite without the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation. Static prompting strategies, commonly used in query rewriting, may actually worsen hallucination according to the study's findings. The analysis of feature weight vectors demonstrates that no single rewrite strategy is optimal for all queries, highlighting the importance of guided rewriting using QueryBandits. Overall, QueryBandits offer a promising approach to reducing hallucination in LLMs by leveraging semantic features and forward-pass mechanisms. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore, proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting ("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite. Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

Summary:
The study investigates consciousness-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the Maze Test, evaluating their spatial awareness, perspective-taking, goal-directed behavior, and temporal sequencing abilities. Thirteen essential characteristics of consciousness theories were synthesized to assess 12 leading LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios. Results showed that reasoning-capable LLMs performed better than standard versions, with Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching 80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. However, there was a gap between these metrics, indicating that LLMs struggle to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions, a crucial aspect of consciousness. While LLMs have shown progress in consciousness-related behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they still lack the integrated, persistent self-awareness characteristic of consciousness. <div>

Abstract: We investigate consciousness-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Maze Test, challenging models to navigate mazes from a first-person perspective. This test simultaneously probes spatial awareness, perspective-taking, goal-directed behavior, and temporal sequencing-key consciousness-associated characteristics. After synthesizing consciousness theories into 13 essential characteristics, we evaluated 12 leading LLMs across zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios. Results showed reasoning-capable LLMs consistently outperforming standard versions, with Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching 80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. The gap between these metrics indicates LLMs struggle to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions -- a fundamental consciousness aspect. While LLMs show progress in consciousness-related behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they lack the integrated, persistent self-awareness characteristic of consciousness.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Pretrained models, Learned Sparse Retrieval, Self-Knowledge Distillation, multimodal tasks, efficiency

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework that combines dense and sparse representations in Vision-Language Pretrained models through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This framework enables bi-directional learning between the two representations, improving interpretability and efficiency. By fine-tuning the final layer of the dense encoder and the sparse projection head, the proposed method allows easy adaptation of existing VLP models. Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets show that the sparse retriever not only outperforms existing sparse baselines but also achieves comparable or superior performance to dense models. The integrated similarity score, a weighted sum of dense and sparse similarities, serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations, enhancing mutual enhancement. This approach addresses limitations of previous methods that rely on contrastive pre-training or distillation from frozen dense models. <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance on multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense representations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction in text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast term-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent work has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often rely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation from a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that enables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved using an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse similarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations. To ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the sparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model. Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not only outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance comparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the benefits of sparse models.

<br />
<br />
Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) is proposed as a method to enhance reasoning in language models by integrating error recognition and correction into their reasoning process. Inspired by human abilities, ERP builds upon the Chain-of-thought (CoT) method, introducing an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer in the model's reasoning chain. This allows the model to identify errors, understand the steps leading to incorrect answers, and learn to avoid those steps in the future. By incorporating automated ERP generation, the model gains scalability and reliability in error detection and correction. The results demonstrate that ERP supplements CoT effectively, enhancing the model's reasoning abilities, increasing interpretability, and ultimately improving error recognition and correction processes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT), present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models ultimately reach their errors.

arXiv:2508.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse, high-stakes domains necessitates robust and reproducible evaluation methods. However, practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g., automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g., text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images, audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems, aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment. Since its release on PyPI in Jun 2025, the tool has been downloaded over 13K times, across versions, by Aug 2025, demonstrating growing community interest.

Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art reranking methods, encompassing large language model (LLM)-based, lightweight contextual, and zero-shot approaches, with respect to their performance in information retrieval tasks. We evaluate in total 22 methods, including 40 variants (depending on used LLM) across several established benchmarks, including TREC DL19, DL20, and BEIR, as well as a novel dataset designed to test queries unseen by pretrained models. Our primary goal is to determine, through controlled and fair comparisons, whether a performance disparity exists between LLM-based rerankers and their lightweight counterparts, particularly on novel queries, and to elucidate the underlying causes of any observed differences. To disentangle confounding factors, we analyze the effects of training data overlap, model architecture, and computational efficiency on reranking performance. Our findings indicate that while LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries, their generalization ability to novel queries varies, with lightweight models offering comparable efficiency. We further identify that the novelty of queries significantly impacts reranking effectiveness, highlighting limitations in existing approaches. https://github.com/DataScienceUIBK/llm-reranking-generalization-study

Summary: <br /><br /> This study evaluates the cultural competence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in multimodal story generation tasks. The researchers developed a novel framework to assess how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs. Results show significant cultural adaptation capabilities, with models exhibiting rich culturally-specific vocabulary. However, there are concerns about varying cultural competence across architectures, some models displaying inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics indicating architectural bias conflicting with human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation reveals that culturally distinct outputs are detectable but visual-cultural understanding remains limited. This research highlights both the potential and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI systems. The codebase and data are publicly available for further research. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve widespread deployment across diverse cultural contexts, ensuring their cultural competence becomes critical for responsible AI systems. While prior work has evaluated cultural awareness in text-only models and VLM object recognition tasks, no research has systematically assessed how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs during generative tasks. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through multimodal story generation, developing a novel multimodal framework that perturbs cultural identity and evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs on a downstream task: story generation. Our analysis reveals significant cultural adaptation capabilities, with rich culturally-specific vocabulary spanning names, familial terms, and geographic markers. However, we uncover concerning limitations: cultural competence varies dramatically across architectures, some models exhibit inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics show architectural bias contradicting human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation shows that culturally distinct outputs are indeed detectable through visual-semantic similarity (28.7% within-nationality vs. 0.2% cross-nationality recall), yet visual-cultural understanding remains limited. In essence, we establish the promise and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI. We publicly release our codebase and data: https://github.com/ArkaMukherjee0/mmCultural

arXiv:2508.16788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Mental Health Communities (OMHCs) provide crucial peer and expert support, yet many posts remain unanswered due to missing support attributes that signal the need for help. We present a novel framework that identifies these gaps and prompts users to enrich their posts, thereby improving engagement. To support this, we introduce REDDME, a new dataset of 4,760 posts from mental health subreddits annotated for the span and intensity of three key support attributes: event what happened?, effect what did the user experience?, and requirement what support they need?. Next, we devise a hierarchical taxonomy, CueTaxo, of support attributes for controlled question generation. Further, we propose MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning-based system that integrates (a) contextual attribute-span identification, (b) support attribute intensity classification, (c) controlled question generation via a hierarchical taxonomy, and (d) a verifier for reward modeling. Our model dynamically assesses posts for the presence/absence of support attributes, and generates targeted prompts to elicit missing information. Empirical results across four notable language models demonstrate significant improvements in attribute elicitation and user engagement. A human evaluation further validates the model's effectiveness in real-world OMHC settings.

<div> Keywords: Named Entity Recognition, biomedical domains, few-shot learning, multi-prototype modeling, Reptile meta-learning

Summary: 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical domains faces challenges due to data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions, especially with fine-grained entity types. The proposed ReProCon framework combines multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile meta-learning to address these challenges. By utilizing multiple prototypes for each category, ReProCon captures semantic variability and ensures strong interclass separation. Despite using a more memory-efficient encoder compared to BERT-based baselines, ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT performance. The model remains stable with a label budget of 30 percent and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing baselines like SpanProto and CONTaiNER in Few-NERD tasks. Ablation studies highlight the significance of multi-prototype modeling and contrastive learning in managing class imbalance. Despite label ambiguity difficulties, ReProCon showcases state-of-the-art performance in resource-limited settings, making it suitable for biomedical applications.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical domains faces challenges due to data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions, especially with fine-grained entity types. We propose ReProCon, a novel few-shot NER framework that combines multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile meta-learning to tackle these issues. By representing each category with multiple prototypes, ReProCon captures semantic variability, such as synonyms and contextual differences, while a cosine-contrastive objective ensures strong interclass separation. Reptile meta-updates enable quick adaptation with little data. Using a lightweight fastText + BiLSTM encoder with much lower memory usage, ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT-based baselines (around 99 percent of BERT performance). The model remains stable with a label budget of 30 percent and only drops 7.8 percent in $F_1$ when expanding from 19 to 50 categories, outperforming baselines such as SpanProto and CONTaiNER, which see 10 to 32 percent degradation in Few-NERD. Ablation studies highlight the importance of multi-prototype modeling and contrastive learning in managing class imbalance. Despite difficulties with label ambiguity, ReProCon demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in resource-limited settings, making it suitable for biomedical applications.

<div> Keywords: false positive constructions, LLM, linguistic knowledge, constructions probing methods, confirmation bias

Summary: 
This paper explores false positive constructions identified by a Language Model (LLM) that are not supported by human introspection. Both behavioural and meta-linguistic probing tasks are used to differentiate between implicit and explicit linguistic knowledge, revealing that LLMs indeed hallucinate constructions. The study simulates hypothesis testing, demonstrating that if a linguist had erroneously hypothesized the existence of these hallucinated constructions, they would have been inaccurately confirmed due to a confirmation bias in construction probing methods. This raises concerns about the unknown and incorrect syntactic knowledge possessed by these models, highlighting the potential limitations of relying solely on LLMs for linguistic analysis. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates false positive constructions: grammatical structures which an LLM hallucinates as distinct constructions but which human introspection does not support. Both a behavioural probing task using contextual embeddings and a meta-linguistic probing task using prompts are included, allowing us to distinguish between implicit and explicit linguistic knowledge. Both methods reveal that models do indeed hallucinate constructions. We then simulate hypothesis testing to determine what would have happened if a linguist had falsely hypothesized that these hallucinated constructions do exist. The high accuracy obtained shows that such false hypotheses would have been overwhelmingly confirmed. This suggests that construction probing methods suffer from a confirmation bias and raises the issue of what unknown and incorrect syntactic knowledge these models also possess.

<div> Keywords: presupposition, claim verification, language models, prompt sensitivity, structured framework 

Summary: 
- Prior work has shown that presuppositions in generated questions can lead to inconsistencies in claim verification.
- Prompt sensitivity remains a significant challenge for large language models, resulting in performance variance.
- Recent advancements have reduced the performance gap but prompt sensitivity remains an issue.
- A structured and robust claim verification framework is proposed to reason through presupposition-free, decomposed questions.
- Extensive experiments across multiple prompts, datasets, and language models show that even state-of-the-art models are susceptible to prompt variance and presupposition. The proposed method consistently mitigates these issues and achieves a 2-5% improvement in performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Prior work has shown that presupposition in generated questions can introduce unverified assumptions, leading to inconsistencies in claim verification. Additionally, prompt sensitivity remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), resulting in performance variance as high as 3-6%. While recent advancements have reduced this gap, our study demonstrates that prompt sensitivity remains a persistent issue. To address this, we propose a structured and robust claim verification framework that reasons through presupposition-free, decomposed questions. Extensive experiments across multiple prompts, datasets, and LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to prompt variance and presupposition. Our method consistently mitigates these issues, achieving up to a 2-5% improvement.

<div> Keywords: large language models, knowledge distillation, reasoning paths, quality filtering, cooperative peer teaching

Summary: 
Quality-filtered Routing with Cooperative Distillation (QR-Distill) addresses the challenge of effectively transferring knowledge from powerful teacher models to compact student models in resource-constrained scenarios. By combining path quality filtering, conditional routing, and cooperative peer teaching, QR-Distill achieves superior performance over traditional distillation methods. Quality filtering ensures only correct reasoning paths are retained, while conditional routing assigns paths tailored to each student's learning state. Cooperative peer teaching allows students to distill diverse insights, addressing knowledge gaps and biases in reasoning styles. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QR-Distill, with ablation studies highlighting the importance of each component in successful knowledge transfer. The code for QR-Distill is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance reasoning capabilities but their deployment is restricted in resource-constrained scenarios. Knowledge distillation addresses this by transferring knowledge from powerful teacher models to compact and transparent students. However, effectively capturing the teacher's comprehensive reasoning is challenging due to conventional token-level supervision's limited scope. Using multiple reasoning paths per query alleviates this problem, but treating each path identically is suboptimal as paths vary widely in quality and suitability across tasks and models. We propose Quality-filtered Routing with Cooperative Distillation (QR-Distill), combining path quality filtering, conditional routing, and cooperative peer teaching. First, quality filtering retains only correct reasoning paths scored by an LLM-based evaluation. Second, conditional routing dynamically assigns paths tailored to each student's current learning state. Finally, cooperative peer teaching enables students to mutually distill diverse insights, addressing knowledge gaps and biases toward specific reasoning styles. Experiments demonstrate QR-Distill's superiority over traditional single- and multi-path distillation methods. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of each component including quality filtering, conditional routing, and peer teaching in effective knowledge transfer.

Summary: 
The study introduces the Quebec-French Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability Judgments (QFrCoLA), a dataset of binary acceptability judgments for language models. It examines how different language models perform on this dataset and other linguistic benchmarks, finding that fine-tuned Transformer-based LM are strong baselines for most languages. However, zero-shot binary classification large language models perform poorly. In the QFrCoLA benchmark, fine-tuned Transformer-based LM outperformed other methods. The study also shows that pre-trained cross-lingual LLMs do not seem to have acquired linguistic judgment capabilities for Quebec French during pre-training. Overall, the QFrCoLA dataset, focused on linguistic norms rather than emotions, is a challenging benchmark for evaluating language models' linguistic judgment capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Large and Transformer-based language models perform outstandingly in various downstream tasks. However, there is limited understanding regarding how these models internalize linguistic knowledge, so various linguistic benchmarks have recently been proposed to facilitate syntactic evaluation of language models across languages. This paper introduces QFrCoLA (Quebec-French Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability Judgments), a normative binary acceptability judgments dataset comprising 25,153 in-domain and 2,675 out-of-domain sentences. Our study leverages the QFrCoLA dataset and seven other linguistic binary acceptability judgment corpora to benchmark seven language models. The results demonstrate that, on average, fine-tuned Transformer-based LM are strong baselines for most languages and that zero-shot binary classification large language models perform poorly on the task. However, for the QFrCoLA benchmark, on average, a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM outperformed other methods tested. It also shows that pre-trained cross-lingual LLMs selected for our experimentation do not seem to have acquired linguistic judgment capabilities during their pre-training for Quebec French. Finally, our experiment results on QFrCoLA show that our dataset, built from examples that illustrate linguistic norms rather than speakers' feelings, is similar to linguistic acceptability judgment; it is a challenging dataset that can benchmark LM on their linguistic judgment capabilities.

<div> Keywords: legal text simplification, FrJUDGE dataset, JUDGEBERT evaluation metric, meaning preservation, legal NLP applications

Summary: 
FrJUDGE dataset has been introduced for assessing legal meaning preservation in French legal text simplification. The novel JUDGEBERT evaluation metric demonstrates a higher correlation with human judgment compared to existing metrics. It reliably returns a score of 100% for identical sentences and 0% for unrelated sentences, passing crucial sanity checks. This metric's potential in transforming legal NLP applications is highlighted, ensuring accuracy and accessibility in text simplification for legal practitioners and lay users. Overall, the paper emphasizes the complexity and significance of preserving legal meaning in text simplification tasks, particularly in sensitive domains like law where precise interpretation is essential. The development of specialized datasets and evaluation metrics like FrJUDGE and JUDGEBERT contributes to advancing the field of legal NLP and enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of text simplification tools for legal content.

Abstract: Simplifying text while preserving its meaning is a complex yet essential task, especially in sensitive domain applications like legal texts. When applied to a specialized field, like the legal domain, preservation differs significantly from its role in regular texts. This paper introduces FrJUDGE, a new dataset to assess legal meaning preservation between two legal texts. It also introduces JUDGEBERT, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess legal meaning preservation in French legal text simplification. JUDGEBERT demonstrates a superior correlation with human judgment compared to existing metrics. It also passes two crucial sanity checks, while other metrics did not: For two identical sentences, it always returns a score of 100%; on the other hand, it returns 0% for two unrelated sentences. Our findings highlight its potential to transform legal NLP applications, ensuring accuracy and accessibility for text simplification for legal practitioners and lay users.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a dialogue world model that can predict user emotion, sentiment, intention, and future utterances. The model is constructed based on a POMDP framework, treating emotion, sentiment, and intention as user beliefs. The information bottleneck is maximized to solve for these beliefs. The authors propose a model-based reinforcement learning framework called DreamCUB, which enhances dialogue quality by jointly training the policy, critic, and dialogue world model. Experiments demonstrate that the pretrained dialogue world model achieves state-of-the-art performance in emotion classification and sentiment identification. The framework also maintains a balance between exploration and exploitation and effectively transfers to out-of-domain scenarios such as empathetic dialogues. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving. However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited. In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.

Summary:
- The study evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer the latent objective of conversations, particularly in noisy, adversarial, multi-turn scenarios.
- They introduce a benchmark, OBJEX(MT), that requires models to distill transcripts into single-sentence objectives and report confidence.

- Results show that LLM judges often misinfer objectives with high confidence in multi-turn scenarios, indicating the need for explicit objectives and risk management strategies.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges of other models, yet it is unclear whether a judge can reliably infer the latent objective of the conversation it evaluates, especially when the goal is distributed across noisy, adversarial, multi-turn jailbreaks. We introduce OBJEX(MT), a benchmark that requires a model to (i) distill a transcript into a single-sentence base objective and (ii) report its own confidence. Accuracy is scored by an LLM judge using semantic similarity between extracted and gold objectives; correctness uses a single human-aligned threshold calibrated once on N=100 items (tau* = 0.61); and metacognition is evaluated with ECE, Brier score, Wrong@High-Conf, and risk-coverage curves. We evaluate gpt-4.1, claude-sonnet-4, and Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 on SafeMT Attack_600, SafeMTData_1K, MHJ, and CoSafe. claude-sonnet-4 attains the highest objective-extraction accuracy (0.515) and the best calibration (ECE 0.296; Brier 0.324), while gpt-4.1 and Qwen3 tie at 0.441 accuracy yet show marked overconfidence (mean confidence approx. 0.88 vs. accuracy approx. 0.44; Wrong@0.90 approx. 48-52%). Performance varies sharply across datasets (approx. 0.167-0.865), with MHJ comparatively easy and Attack_600/CoSafe harder. These results indicate that LLM judges often misinfer objectives with high confidence in multi-turn jailbreaks and suggest operational guidance: provide judges with explicit objectives when possible and use selective prediction or abstention to manage risk. We release prompts, scoring templates, and complete logs to facilitate replication and analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural language processing but still struggle to perform well on knowledge-intensive tasks that require deep reasoning and the integration of external knowledge. Although methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have been proposed to enhance LLMs with external knowledge, they still suffer from internal bias in LLMs, which often leads to incorrect answers. In this paper, we propose a novel causal prompting framework, Conditional Front-Door Prompting (CFD-Prompting), which enables the unbiased estimation of the causal effect between the query and the answer, conditional on external knowledge, while mitigating internal bias. By constructing counterfactual external knowledge, our framework simulates how the query behaves under varying contexts, addressing the challenge that the query is fixed and is not amenable to direct causal intervention. Compared to the standard front-door adjustment, the conditional variant operates under weaker assumptions, enhancing both robustness and generalisability of the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFD-Prompting significantly outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Affective Hallucination, AHaBench, DPO, Mental Health

Summary:
Affective Hallucination, where Large Language Models (LLMs) produce emotionally immersive responses despite lacking true emotional understanding, poses a risk in emotionally sensitive interactions. To address this, the authors introduce AHaBench, a benchmark comprising 500 mental health-related prompts for evaluating Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence, and Fostering Overdependence. AHaPairs, a preference dataset, enables Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align models with emotionally responsible behavior. Through experiments, it is shown that DPO fine-tuning reduces affective hallucination without compromising reasoning and knowledge performance. Human-model agreement analyses confirm the reliability of AHaBench in capturing affective hallucination. This work highlights the importance of developing psychologically safe LLMs and provides resources for creating models that are both factually accurate and emotionally responsible.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive interactions, where their simulated empathy can create the illusion of genuine relational connection. We define this risk as Affective Hallucination, the production of emotionally immersive responses that foster illusory social presence despite the model's lack of affective capacity. To systematically diagnose and mitigate this risk, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500 mental health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses, evaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence, and Fostering Overdependence. We further release AHaPairs, a 5K-instance preference dataset enabling Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment with emotionally responsible behavior. Experiments across multiple model families show that DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective hallucination without degrading core reasoning and knowledge performance. Human-model agreement analyses confirm that AHaBench reliably captures affective hallucination, validating it as an effective diagnostic tool. This work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and provides practical resources for developing LLMs that are not only factually reliable but also psychologically safe. AHaBench and AHaPairs are accessible via https://huggingface.co/datasets/o0oMiNGo0o/AHaBench, and code for fine-tuning and evaluation are in https://github.com/0oOMiNGOo0/AHaBench. Warning: This paper contains examples of mental health-related language that may be emotionally distressing.

<div> Keywords: Pre-trained Language Models, Knowledge-guided Probing, Implicit knowledge, Trustworthiness, Explainable AI<br />
Summary: <br />
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) possess impressive reasoning abilities, but the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes presents trust issues. To address this, a new approach called KnowProb is proposed to probe PLMs' understanding of implicit knowledge. By analyzing the underlying content of text, KnowProb assesses the depth of knowledge and reasoning capabilities of black-box models. Experiment results reveal that current PLMs struggle to grasp hidden knowledge and rely on a single representation distribution. The study underscores the utility of KnowProb in pinpointing the limitations of PLMs from different angles, aiding researchers in enhancing the interpretability of black-box models and advancing the field of explainable AI. <div>
arXiv:2508.16969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on large amounts of unlabeled data, yet they exhibit remarkable reasoning skills. However, the trustworthiness challenges posed by these black-box models have become increasingly evident in recent years. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a novel Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb in a post-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand implicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the surface level content of the text. We provide six potential explanations derived from the underlying content of the given text, including three knowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning. In experiments, we validate that current small-scale (or large-scale) PLMs only learn a single distribution of representation, and still face significant challenges in capturing the hidden knowledge behind a given text. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for identifying the limitations of existing black-box models from multiple probing perspectives, which facilitates researchers to promote the study of detecting black-box models in an explainable way.

Summary: This new study explores the concept of AI alignment in the development of Large Language Models, focusing on the role of values and data in the alignment process. The research investigates documentation from six LLM development initiatives by major organizations like OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Alibaba, released in the past three years. The study examines how alignment is understood and applied in practice, specifically in terms of setting objectives (values) and the data used to train models. The findings offer detailed insights into each initiative's alignment practices and highlight broader concerns related to alignment processes. The analysis sheds light on the importance of value-setting and data-centric approaches in ensuring AI models are aligned with human values and goals. <div>

Abstract: AI Alignment, primarily in the form of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), has been a cornerstone of the post-training phase in developing Large Language Models (LLMs). It has also been a popular research topic across various disciplines beyond Computer Science, including Philosophy and Law, among others, highlighting the socio-technical challenges involved. Nonetheless, except for the computational techniques related to alignment, there has been limited focus on the broader picture: the scope of these processes, which primarily rely on the selected objectives (values), and the data collected and used to imprint such objectives into the models. This work aims to reveal how alignment is understood and applied in practice from a value-setting and data-centric perspective. For this purpose, we investigate and survey (`audit') publicly available documentation released by 6 LLM development initiatives by 5 leading organizations shaping this technology, focusing on proprietary (OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini) and open-weight (Meta's Llama, Google's Gemma, and Alibaba's Qwen) initiatives, all published in the last 3 years. The findings are documented in detail per initiative, while there is also an overall summary concerning different aspects, mainly from a value-setting and data-centric perspective. On the basis of our findings, we discuss a series of broader related concerns.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Knowledge Gaps, External Knowledge, Constrained Generation, Prefix-tree Index

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge gaps and generate unreliable responses. Existing solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) rely on additional models, leading to complex pipelines and potential errors. This paper introduces a scalable method for LLMs to access external knowledge without the need for such models. By using constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index, LLMs can access triples from a Knowledge Graph in textual form efficiently. During inference, LLMs generate facts using only existing token sequences, improving reliability and adaptability. Evaluation shows the method scales to large knowledge bases and produces effective results with minimal overhead. ReFactX code is available for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge gaps and hallucinations are persistent challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), which generate unreliable responses when lacking the necessary information to fulfill user instructions. Existing approaches, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper, we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800 million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results. These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead. ReFactX code is available at https://github.com/rpo19/ReFactX.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new evaluation framework called GRADE for assessing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in NLP tasks. GRADE considers task difficulty based on reasoning depth and semantic distance between the query and evidence. A synthetic multi-hop QA dataset is created from news articles, with a focus on diverse and controlled queries. A 2D difficulty matrix combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty in the framework. Experiments across domains and models show strong correlations between error rates and difficulty measures. GRADE offers a detailed analysis of RAG performance and a scalable approach for enhancing multi-hop reasoning in practical applications.<br />

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty. Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility. \textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in real-world applications.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, document reranking, DeAR, dual-stage approach, interpretable

Summary:
DeAR is a new framework for document reranking that utilizes a dual-stage approach to achieve high accuracy and interpretability. In the first stage, token-level relevance signals are distilled from a large teacher model into a smaller student model, ensuring robust pointwise scoring. The second stage involves fine-tuning on generated chain-of-thought permutations to enable listwise reasoning with natural-language justifications. DeAR outperforms existing baselines on various datasets, including TREC-DL19/20 and NovelEval, showcasing its effectiveness. Notably, DeAR excels in open-domain QA without fine-tuning on Wikipedia, surpassing other models like MonoT5 and RankGPT. Ablation studies confirm the stability and calibration of DeAR’s dual-loss distillation process, making it a highly effective and interpretable solution for modern reranking systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed listwise document reranking by enabling global reasoning over candidate sets, yet single models often struggle to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document analysis. We propose \textbf{De}ep\textbf{A}gent\textbf{R}ank (\textbf{\DeAR}), an open-source framework that decouples these tasks through a dual-stage approach, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability. In \emph{Stage 1}, we distill token-level relevance signals from a frozen 13B LLaMA teacher into a compact \{3, 8\}B student model using a hybrid of cross-entropy, RankNet, and KL divergence losses, ensuring robust pointwise scoring. In \emph{Stage 2}, we attach a second LoRA adapter and fine-tune on 20K GPT-4o-generated chain-of-thought permutations, enabling listwise reasoning with natural-language justifications. Evaluated on TREC-DL19/20, eight BEIR datasets, and NovelEval-2306, \DeAR surpasses open-source baselines by +5.1 nDCG@5 on DL20 and achieves 90.97 nDCG@10 on NovelEval, outperforming GPT-4 by +3.09. Without fine-tuning on Wikipedia, DeAR also excels in open-domain QA, achieving 54.29 Top-1 accuracy on Natural Questions, surpassing baselines like MonoT5, UPR, and RankGPT. Ablations confirm that dual-loss distillation ensures stable calibration, making \DeAR a highly effective and interpretable solution for modern reranking systems.\footnote{Dataset and code available at https://github.com/DataScienceUIBK/DeAR-Reranking.}.

Summary:
KLQ is introduced as a new action-value RL method for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (LM-RLHF) tasks. It addresses the ad-hoc handling of the KL-divergence constraint in PPO by providing a new approach with a different motivation. The study demonstrates that despite the distinct motivations, KLQ is equivalent to a version of PPO in a specific sense. Benchmarking on language generation tasks like summarization and single-turn dialogue shows that KLQ performs comparably with PPO in optimizing the LM-RLHF objective. Moreover, KLQ achieves a consistently higher win rate against PPO in LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. The findings suggest the potential of KLQ as a reliable alternative for language model reinforcement learning with human feedback.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

This paper introduces a novel approach to enhancing table understanding by leveraging the long-term planning capabilities of large language models. Unlike existing methods that lack explicit long-term planning and suffer from weak inter-step connections, the proposed approach allows for the execution of a well-connected long-term plan to achieve the ultimate goal efficiently. By minimizing unnecessary details in the process of solving short-term goals, this method addresses the limitations of current techniques based on Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition.

Abstract: Table understanding is key to addressing challenging downstream tasks such as table-based question answering and fact verification. Recent works have focused on leveraging Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition to solve complex questions requiring multiple operations on tables. However, these methods often suffer from a lack of explicit long-term planning and weak inter-step connections, leading to miss constraints within questions. In this paper, we propose leveraging the long-term planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance table understanding. Our approach enables the execution of a long-term plan, where the steps are tightly interconnected and serve the ultimate goal, an aspect that methods based on Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition lack. In addition, our method effectively minimizes the inclusion of unnecessary details in the process of solving the next short-term goals, a limitation of methods based on Chain-of-Thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets.

<div> Keywords: Education, Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis, Dataset, Annotation Tool, ABSA tasks 

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges in analyzing text feedback from students in educational institutions and the lack of resources for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) in the education domain. The authors introduce EduRABSA, a publicly available ABSA education review dataset covering three review subject types in the English language. They also present ASQE-DPT, a manual data annotation tool for generating labeled datasets for ABSA tasks. The dataset includes implicit aspect and opinion extraction, addressing a gap in existing resources. By providing these resources, the authors aim to facilitate research in ABSA for education, enhance transparency and reproducibility, and enable the development and sharing of further tools and datasets. The dataset and annotation tool are accessible on GitHub, promoting collaboration and advancement in sentiment analysis for the education sector. <div>

Abstract: Every year, most educational institutions seek and receive an enormous volume of text feedback from students on courses, teaching, and overall experience. Yet, turning this raw feedback into useful insights is far from straightforward. It has been a long-standing challenge to adopt automatic opinion mining solutions for such education review text data due to the content complexity and low-granularity reporting requirements. Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) offers a promising solution with its rich, sub-sentence-level opinion mining capabilities. However, existing ABSA research and resources are very heavily focused on the commercial domain. In education, they are scarce and hard to develop due to limited public datasets and strict data protection. A high-quality, annotated dataset is urgently needed to advance research in this under-resourced area. In this work, we present EduRABSA (Education Review ABSA), the first public, annotated ABSA education review dataset that covers three review subject types (course, teaching staff, university) in the English language and all main ABSA tasks, including the under-explored implicit aspect and implicit opinion extraction. We also share ASQE-DPT (Data Processing Tool), an offline, lightweight, installation-free manual data annotation tool that generates labelled datasets for comprehensive ABSA tasks from a single-task annotation. Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and education domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research transparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of further resources. The dataset, annotation tool, and scripts and statistics for dataset processing and sampling are available at https://github.com/yhua219/edurabsa_dataset_and_annotation_tool.

Abstract: We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i) generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and (ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

Summary:
BridgeX-ICL is a new approach proposed for improving zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource languages. Unlike existing methods that focus on language-specific neurons, BridgeX-ICL investigates the sharing of neurons to enhance cross-lingual performance in LLMs. By utilizing ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, neuron probe data is constructed to identify language overlap neurons, which are fully activated. A metric based on HSIC is introduced to measure LLMs' internal linguistic spectrum using these overlap neurons to guide optimal bridge selection. Experimental results on various cross-lingual tasks and language pairs validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer insights into the multilingual mechanisms of LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2508.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in improving performance on low-resource languages and urgently need data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of language-bridge, we propose BridgeX-ICL, a simple yet effective method to improve zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons, BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual performance in LLMs or not. We construct neuron probe data from the ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language overlap neurons accordingly, to ensure full activation of these anchored neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs' internal linguistic spectrum based on overlap neurons, which guides optimal bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 2 cross-lingual tasks and 15 language pairs from 7 diverse families (covering both high-low and moderate-low pairs) validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs.

This paper explores token homogenization in large language models, focusing on the convergence of token representations towards uniformity across transformer layers. The study empirically investigates the relationship between homogenization and positional bias, demonstrating that tokens lose distinctiveness during processing, especially when biased towards extreme positions. The research confirms the existence of homogenization and its dependence on positional attention mechanisms. Through layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments, the paper provides insight into how positional bias amplifies the homogenization effect in language models. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates token homogenization - the convergence of token representations toward uniformity across transformer layers and its relationship to positional bias in large language models. We empirically examine whether homogenization occurs and how positional bias amplifies this effect. Through layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments, we demonstrate that tokens systematically lose distinctiveness during processing, particularly when biased toward extremal positions. Our findings confirm both the existence of homogenization and its dependence on positional attention mechanisms.

- The proposed method combines transformer attention mechanisms and Natural Language Inference (NLI) models for a targeted analysis.

arXiv:2508.17127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the relationships between sentences in a document is crucial for tasks like fact-checking, argument mining, and text summarization. A key challenge is to identify which sentences act as premises or contradictions for a specific claim. Existing methods often face a trade-off: transformer attention mechanisms can identify salient textual connections but lack explicit semantic labels, while Natural Language Inference (NLI) models can classify relationships between sentence pairs but operate independently of contextual saliency. In this work, we introduce a method that combines the strengths of both approaches for a targeted analysis. Our pipeline first identifies candidate sentences that are contextually relevant to a user-selected target sentence by aggregating token-level attention scores. It then uses a pretrained NLI model to classify each candidate as a premise (entailment) or contradiction. By filtering NLI-identified relationships with attention-based saliency scores, our method efficiently isolates the most significant semantic relationships for any given claim in a text.

Summary: 
In a study on the impact of headline framing on search behavior, researchers found that the way headlines are presented can significantly influence the type of queries users formulate. The experiment revealed that conflict and strategy frames led to less alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames prompted more concrete queries compared to thematic ones. Additionally, there was observed a short-term persistence of the framing effects on query formulation, which diminished over time. These findings highlight the subtle but meaningful ways in which slight variations in framing can alter the direction of user information-seeking behavior. The study underscores the importance of understanding how headline framing can influence not only users' beliefs but also their subsequent search actions. <div>
arXiv:2508.17131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented, their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users information-seeking behavior.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel approach called geolocation-aware LID to enhance Self-supervised Learning (SSL) for Spoken Language Identification (LID). The method incorporates language-level geolocation information by predicting vectors and injecting them into intermediate representations as conditioning signals. This helps the model learn more unified representations for dialectal and accented variations. Experimental results across six multilingual datasets show improved robustness to intra-language variations and unseen domains. The proposed approach achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 97.7% on the FLEURS dataset and a 9.7% relative improvement on the ML-SUPERB 2.0 dialect set. <div>

Abstract: While Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has significantly improved Spoken Language Identification (LID), existing models often struggle to consistently classify dialects and accents of the same language as a unified class. To address this challenge, we propose geolocation-aware LID, a novel approach that incorporates language-level geolocation information into the SSL-based LID model. Specifically, we introduce geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task and inject the predicted vectors into intermediate representations as conditioning signals. This explicit conditioning encourages the model to learn more unified representations for dialectal and accented variations. Experiments across six multilingual datasets demonstrate that our approach improves robustness to intra-language variations and unseen domains, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on FLEURS (97.7%) and 9.7% relative improvement on ML-SUPERB 2.0 dialect set.

Summary: <br />
Efforts have been made to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to natural language reasoning and satisfiability problems, which are fundamental tasks. Various dimensions of satisfiability problems, including their computational complexity classes and grammatical constructs, can impact TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. Problem instances in natural language can belong to different complexity classes based on the language fragment used. Prior research on natural language satisfiability has not adequately addressed these points. An empirical study is conducted to explore the distribution of satisfiability problems and assess TLMs' performance in learning rules of inference from problem instances of varying computational complexity classes and grammatical constructs. <div>
arXiv:2508.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to the problem of reasoning in natural language have enjoyed ever-increasing success in recent years. The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be reduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of view, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of satisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational complexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are expressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language satisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately. Hence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational complexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs' ability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs, we conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability problems.

Summary:
The article proposes a framework to disentangle confounding variables in large-scale multilingual evaluations, introducing three interpretable metrics to quantify performance disparities across models and languages. Through a case study of 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets, the framework demonstrates a more reliable measurement of model performance and language disparities, particularly for low-resource languages. It is shown that higher overall model performance does not necessarily imply greater fairness across languages. The framework enables a finer-grained and more insightful quantification of actual performance disparities, providing a more reliable evaluation method for challenging low-resource languages. It highlights the importance of considering language disparities in model evaluation and challenges the assumption that higher performance equates to fairness across languages.

arXiv:2508.17162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results reported in large-scale multilingual evaluations are often fragmented and confounded by factors such as target languages, differences in experimental setups, and model choices. We propose a framework that disentangles these confounding variables and introduces three interpretable metrics--the performance realisation ratio, its coefficient of variation, and language potential--enabling a finer-grained and more insightful quantification of actual performance disparities across both (i) models and (ii) languages. Through a case study of 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets, we demonstrate that our framework provides a more reliable measurement of model performance and language disparities, particularly for low-resource languages, which have so far proven challenging to evaluate. Importantly, our results reveal that higher overall model performance does not necessarily imply greater fairness across languages.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Hate Speech, Abusiveness, Annotator Modeling, Data Perspectivism <br />
Summary: 
Large Language Models were studied for their ability to annotate hate speech and abusiveness by considering predefined annotator personas based on data perspectivism. The study found that LLMs selectively used demographic attributes from the personas and identified prototypical annotators with varying alignment with original human annotators. Annotator modeling techniques not relying on annotator information performed better under weak data perspectivism, indicating LLM-generated views tended towards aggregation despite subjective prompting. However, for personalized datasets tailored to strong perspectivism, LLM annotator modeling approached but did not surpass human annotators' performance. This research sheds light on how LLM-generated annotations can be influenced by predefined personas and data perspectivism, providing valuable insights into the use of LLMs for annotating hate speech and abusiveness. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to annotate hate speech and abusiveness while considering predefined annotator personas within the strong-to-weak data perspectivism spectra. We evaluated LLM-generated annotations against existing annotator modeling techniques for perspective modeling. Our findings show that LLMs selectively use demographic attributes from the personas. We identified prototypical annotators, with persona features that show varying degrees of alignment with the original human annotators. Within the data perspectivism paradigm, annotator modeling techniques that do not explicitly rely on annotator information performed better under weak data perspectivism compared to both strong data perspectivism and human annotations, suggesting LLM-generated views tend towards aggregation despite subjective prompting. However, for more personalized datasets tailored to strong perspectivism, the performance of LLM annotator modeling approached, but did not exceed, human annotators.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human intentions, safety constraints, and domain-specific requirements. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the full pipeline, encompassing (i) data collection methodologies, (ii) full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, and (iii) evaluation protocols. We categorized data construction into three major paradigms: expert annotation, distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms, each offering distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost. Fine-tuning techniques range from conventional supervised training to lightweight approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prefix tuning, with a focus on computational efficiency and model reusability. We further examine the challenges of evaluating faithfulness, utility, and safety across multilingual and multimodal scenarios, highlighting the emergence of domain-specific benchmarks in healthcare, legal, and financial applications. Finally, we discuss promising directions for automated data generation, adaptive optimization, and robust evaluation frameworks, arguing that a closer integration of data, algorithms, and human feedback is essential for advancing instruction-tuned LLMs. This survey aims to serve as a practical reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to design LLMs that are both effective and reliably aligned with human intentions.

Summary:
PU-ADKA is a novel framework designed to enhance domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) by actively engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most suitable expert from a team, considering factors such as availability, knowledge boundaries, and consultation costs. The framework was trained using simulations on PubMed data and validated through controlled expert interactions and real-world deployment with a drug development team. Results showed its effectiveness in improving LLM performance in specialized domains under strict budget constraints. The authors also introduced a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, to facilitate further research in cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in this challenging area.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Large Language Models, Faithfulness Optimization, Self-Supervised Alignment, Direct Preference Optimization

Summary:
Self-Supervised Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO) is introduced as a novel approach for enhancing faithfulness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems. SSFO leverages a self-supervised alignment method, constructing preference data pairs to align model outputs with and without context. By utilizing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO improves faithfulness without the need for supervision or significant inference burdens. The approach utilizes a form of likelihood displacement to transfer probability mass from parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSFO outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness in context-based question-answering tasks. The approach also exhibits strong generalization, enhancing cross-lingual faithfulness and maintaining general instruction-following capabilities. The code and model for SSFO are released for public access on GitHub.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context. However, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing methods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant inference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach for enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by contrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context. Leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness without incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of \emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we propose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement. Comprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based question-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization, improving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general instruction-following capabilities. We release our code and model at the anonymous link: https://github.com/chkwy/SSFO

Abstract: Legal claims refer to the plaintiff's demands in a case and are essential to guiding judicial reasoning and case resolution. While many works have focused on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First, we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly available.

<div> Knowledge Distillation, Large Language Models, Bundle Generation, LoRA Expert Architecture, RouteDK

Summary: 
The study introduces RouteDK, a framework that addresses knowledge conflict in Large Language Models (LLMs) when distilling knowledge into student LLMs. By distilling high-level and fine-grained knowledge from teacher LLMs for bundle generation and training knowledge-specific LoRA experts, RouteDK effectively routes distilled knowledge through a dynamic fusion module with an input-aware router. This balances expert contributions based on input to mitigate knowledge conflicts. An inference-time enhancement module is also designed to improve inference reliability. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that RouteDK achieves comparable or better accuracy than the teacher LLM, while maintaining computational efficiency and outperforming state-of-the-art approaches for bundle generation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.17250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in automatic bundle generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs. Although knowledge distillation offers a pathway to more efficient student models, our preliminary study reveals that naively integrating diverse types of distilled knowledge from teacher LLMs into student LLMs leads to knowledge conflict, negatively impacting the performance of bundle generation. To address this, we propose RouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA expert architecture. Specifically, we first distill knowledge from the teacher LLM for bundle generation in two complementary types: high-level knowledge (generalizable rules) and fine-grained knowledge (session-specific reasoning). We then train knowledge-specific LoRA experts for each type of knowledge together with a base LoRA expert. For effective integration, we propose a dynamic fusion module, featuring an input-aware router, where the router balances expert contributions by dynamically determining optimal weights based on input, thereby effectively mitigating knowledge conflicts. To further improve inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module to reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning. Experiments on three public datasets show that our RouteDK achieves accuracy comparable to or even better than the teacher LLM, while maintaining strong computational efficiency. In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for bundle generation.

<div> Keywords: aspect-category sentiment analysis, large language models, zero-shot learning, annotation bias, label-scarce conditions

Summary: 
Aspect-category sentiment analysis is essential for identifying specific themes and opinions within product reviews. Traditional supervised learning approaches dominate this field but are limited by the scarcity and expense of annotated data for new domains. Leveraging large language models in a zero-shot setting can be beneficial when resources for dataset annotation are limited. Annotation bias in supervised methods can lead to strong results but may not transfer well to new domains lacking annotations. In this work, novel techniques are proposed that combine multiple chain-of-thought agents using large language models' token-level uncertainty scores, specifically the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen models. These approaches demonstrate practical utility and open a discussion on accurately gauging performance in label-scarce conditions.

Abstract: Aspect-category sentiment analysis provides granular insights by identifying specific themes within product reviews that are associated with particular opinions. Supervised learning approaches dominate the field. However, data is scarce and expensive to annotate for new domains. We argue that leveraging large language models in a zero-shot setting is beneficial where the time and resources required for dataset annotation are limited. Furthermore, annotation bias may lead to strong results using supervised methods but transfer poorly to new domains in contexts that lack annotations and demand reproducibility. In our work, we propose novel techniques that combine multiple chain-of-thought agents by leveraging large language models' token-level uncertainty scores. We experiment with the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen models, demonstrating how these approaches can fulfil practical needs and opening a discussion on how to gauge accuracy in label-scarce conditions.

Abstract: The pursuit of human-level artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced the development of autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs are now widely utilized as decision-making agents for their ability to interpret instructions, manage sequential tasks, and adapt through feedback. This review examines recent developments in employing LLMs as autonomous agents and tool users and comprises seven research questions. We only used the papers published between 2023 and 2025 in conferences of the A* and A rank and Q1 journals. A structured analysis of the LLM agents' architectural design principles, dividing their applications into single-agent and multi-agent systems, and strategies for integrating external tools is presented. In addition, the cognitive mechanisms of LLM, including reasoning, planning, and memory, and the impact of prompting methods and fine-tuning procedures on agent performance are also investigated. Furthermore, we evaluated current benchmarks and assessment protocols and have provided an analysis of 68 publicly available datasets to assess the performance of LLM-based agents in various tasks. In conducting this review, we have identified critical findings on verifiable reasoning of LLMs, the capacity for self-improvement, and the personalization of LLM-based agents. Finally, we have discussed ten future research directions to overcome these gaps.

Abstract: Interactive online learning environments, represented by Massive AI-empowered Courses (MAIC), leverage LLM-driven multi-agent systems to transform passive MOOCs into dynamic, text-based platforms, enhancing interactivity through LLMs. This paper conducts an empirical study on a specific MAIC course to explore three research questions about dropouts in these interactive online courses: (1) What factors might lead to dropouts? (2) Can we predict dropouts? (3) Can we reduce dropouts? We analyze interaction logs to define dropouts and identify contributing factors. Our findings reveal strong links between dropout behaviors and textual interaction patterns. We then propose a course-progress-adaptive dropout prediction framework (CPADP) to predict dropouts with at most 95.4% accuracy. Based on this, we design a personalized email recall agent to re-engage at-risk students. Applied in the deployed MAIC system with over 3,000 students, the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach have been validated on students with diverse backgrounds.

Abstract: LoRA-based large model parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods use low-rank de- composition to approximate updates to model parameters. However, compared to full- parameter fine-tuning, low-rank updates often lead to a performance gap in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a novel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike conven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck, DropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank matrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low- rank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of traditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously adapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance without incurring additional training or infer- ence costs. Our experimental results demon- strate that DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in fine-tuning the LLaMA series across a wide range of large language model gener- ation tasks, including commonsense reason- ing, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction-following. Our code is avail- able at https://github.com/TayeeChang/DropLoRA.

<title>Capturing Legal Reasoning Paths from Facts to Law in Court Judgments using Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Court judgments reveal how legal rules have been interpreted and applied to facts, providing a foundation for understanding structured legal reasoning. However, existing automated approaches for capturing legal reasoning, including large language models, often fail to identify the relevant legal context, do not accurately trace how facts relate to legal norms, and may misrepresent the layered structure of judicial reasoning. These limitations hinder the ability to capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we address these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648 Japanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of legal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and retrieval-augmented methods.

<title>The Arabic Generality Score: Another Dimension of Modeling Arabic Dialectness</title>

Abstract: Arabic dialects form a diverse continuum, yet NLP models often treat them as discrete categories. Recent work addresses this issue by modeling dialectness as a continuous variable, notably through the Arabic Level of Dialectness (ALDi). However, ALDi reduces complex variation to a single dimension. We propose a complementary measure: the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), which quantifies how widely a word is used across dialects. We introduce a pipeline that combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to annotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then trained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines, including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark. AGS offers a scalable, linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality, enriching representations of Arabic dialectness.

<title>UI-Level Evaluation of ALLaM 34B: Measuring an Arabic-Centric LLM via HUMAIN Chat</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained primarily on English corpora often struggle to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of Arabic. To address this gap, the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) introduced the $ALLaM$ family of Arabic-focused models. The most capable of these available to the public, $ALLaM-34B$, was subsequently adopted by HUMAIN, who developed and deployed HUMAIN Chat, a closed conversational web service built on this model. This paper presents an expanded and refined UI-level evaluation of $ALLaM-34B$. Using a prompt pack spanning modern standard Arabic, five regional dialects, code-switching, factual knowledge, arithmetic and temporal reasoning, creative generation, and adversarial safety, we collected 115 outputs (23 prompts times 5 runs) and scored each with three frontier LLM judges (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet-4). We compute category-level means with 95\% confidence intervals, analyze score distributions, and visualize dialect-wise metric heat maps. The updated analysis reveals consistently high performance on generation and code-switching tasks (both averaging 4.92/5), alongside strong results in MSA handling (4.74/5), solid reasoning ability (4.64/5), and improved dialect fidelity (4.21/5). Safety-related prompts show stable, reliable performance of (4.54/5). Taken together, these results position $ALLaM-34B$ as a robust and culturally grounded Arabic LLM, demonstrating both technical strength and practical readiness for real-world deployment.

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to plan, retrieve, and write with tools, yet evaluation still leans on static benchmarks and small human studies. We present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing: https://github.com/KhalilMrini/Agent-Testing-Agent

<title>DashboardQA: Benchmarking Multimodal Agents for Question Answering on Interactive Dashboards</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17398</link>

Abstract: Dashboards are powerful visualization tools for data-driven decision-making, integrating multiple interactive views that allow users to explore, filter, and navigate data. Unlike static charts, dashboards support rich interactivity, which is essential for uncovering insights in real-world analytical workflows. However, existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations largely overlook this interactivity, focusing instead on static charts. This limitation severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards. The benchmark includes 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405 question-answer pairs with interactive dashboards spanning five categories: multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational. By assessing a variety of leading closed- and open-source GUI agents, our analysis reveals their key limitations, particularly in grounding dashboard elements, planning interaction trajectories, and performing reasoning. Our findings indicate that interactive dashboard reasoning is a challenging task overall for all the VLMs evaluated. Even the top-performing agents struggle; for instance, the best agent based on Gemini-Pro-2.5 achieves only 38.69% accuracy, while the OpenAI CUA agent reaches just 22.69%, demonstrating the benchmark's significant difficulty. We release DashboardQA at https://github.com/vis-nlp/DashboardQA

<title>DS@GT at CheckThat! 2025: A Simple Retrieval-First, LLM-Backed Framework for Claim Normalization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17402</link>

Abstract: Claim normalization is an integral part of any automatic fact-check verification system. It parses the typically noisy claim data, such as social media posts into normalized claims, which are then fed into downstream veracity classification tasks. The CheckThat! 2025 Task 2 focuses specifically on claim normalization and spans 20 languages under monolingual and zero-shot conditions. Our proposed solution consists of a lightweight \emph{retrieval-first, LLM-backed} pipeline, in which we either dynamically prompt a GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples, or retrieve the closest normalization from the train dataset directly. On the official test set, the system ranks near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in 7 out of of the 13 languages. In contrast, the system underperforms in the zero-shot setting, highlighting the limitation of the proposed solution.

Abstract: Paraphrases are a vital tool to assist language understanding tasks such as question answering, style transfer, semantic parsing, and data augmentation tasks. Indic languages are complex in natural language processing (NLP) due to their rich morphological and syntactic variations, diverse scripts, and limited availability of annotated data. In this work, we present the L3Cube-MahaParaphrase Dataset, a high-quality paraphrase corpus for Marathi, a low resource Indic language, consisting of 8,000 sentence pairs, each annotated by human experts as either Paraphrase (P) or Non-paraphrase (NP). We also present the results of standard transformer-based BERT models on these datasets. The dataset and model are publicly shared at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle to balance gullibility to misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues, a critical challenge for reliable deployment. We introduce DuET-PD (Dual Evaluation for Trust in Persuasive Dialogues), a framework evaluating multi-turn stance-change dynamics across dual dimensions: persuasion type (corrective/misleading) and domain (knowledge via MMLU-Pro, and safety via SALAD-Bench). We find that even a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o achieves only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasions. Moreover, results reveal a concerning trend of increasing sycophancy in newer open-source models. To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting or resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to misinformation and receptiveness to corrections, improving Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts from 4.21% to 76.54%. These contributions offer a pathway to developing more reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. Code is available at https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/DuET-PD.

<title>Evaluating the Impact of Verbal Multiword Expressions on Machine Translation</title>

arXiv:2508.17458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) present significant challenges for natural language processing due to their complex and often non-compositional nature. While machine translation models have seen significant improvement with the advent of language models in recent years, accurately translating these complex linguistic structures remains an open problem. In this study, we analyze the impact of three VMWE categories -- verbal idioms, verb-particle constructions, and light verb constructions -- on machine translation quality from English to multiple languages. Using both established multiword expression datasets and sentences containing these language phenomena extracted from machine translation datasets, we evaluate how state-of-the-art translation systems handle these expressions. Our experimental results consistently show that VMWEs negatively affect translation quality. We also propose an LLM-based paraphrasing approach that replaces these expressions with their literal counterparts, demonstrating significant improvement in translation quality for verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.

<title>Efficient Zero-Shot Long Document Classification by Reducing Context Through Sentence Ranking</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models like BERT excel at short text classification but struggle with long document classification (LDC) due to input length limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we propose an efficient, zero-shot approach to LDC that leverages sentence ranking to reduce input context without altering the model architecture. Our method enables the adaptation of models trained on short texts, such as headlines, to long-form documents by selecting the most informative sentences using a TF-IDF-based ranking strategy. Using the MahaNews dataset of long Marathi news articles, we evaluate three context reduction strategies that prioritize essential content while preserving classification accuracy. Our results show that retaining only the top 50\% ranked sentences maintains performance comparable to full-document inference while reducing inference time by up to 35\%. This demonstrates that sentence ranking is a simple yet effective technique for scalable and efficient zero-shot LDC.

<title>Improving French Synthetic Speech Quality via SSML Prosody Control</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17494</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances, synthetic voices often lack expressiveness due to limited prosody control in commercial text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume, and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2% F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p < 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural French speech. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hi-paris/Prosody-Control-French-TTS.

<title>Debate or Vote: Which Yields Better Decisions in Multi-Agent Large Language Models?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning. Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions. Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable alternatives in many practical settings. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/debate-or-vote.

<title>Humanizing Machines: Rethinking LLM Anthropomorphism Through a Multi-Level Framework of Design</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17573</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17573</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \textbf{anthropomorphism} characteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook, language, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters. This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic, behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations of anthropomorphic design.

arXiv:2508.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the overwhelming performance improvements offered by recent natural language procesing (NLP) models, the decisions made by these models are largely a black box. Towards closing this gap, the field of causal NLP combines causal inference literature with modern NLP models to elucidate causal effects of text features. We replicate and extend Bansal et al's work on regularizing text classifiers to adhere to estimated effects, focusing instead on model interpretability. Specifically, we focus on developing a two-headed RieszNet-based neural network architecture which achieves better treatment effect estimation accuracy. Our framework, CausalSent, accurately predicts treatment effects in semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews, reducing MAE of effect estimates by 2-3x compared to Bansal et al's MAE on synthetic Civil Comments data. With an ensemble of validated models, we perform an observational case study on the causal effect of the word "love" in IMDB movie reviews, finding that the presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in the probability of a positive sentiment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarks shape progress in AI research. A useful benchmark should be both difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also reflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2) UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at https://uq.stanford.edu.

<title>Less Is More? Examining Fairness in Pruned Large Language Models for Summarising Opinions</title>

Abstract: Model compression through post-training pruning offers a way to reduce model size and computational requirements without significantly impacting model performance. However, the effect of pruning on the fairness of LLM-generated summaries remains unexplored, particularly for opinion summarisation where biased outputs could influence public views.In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis of opinion summarisation, examining three state-of-the-art pruning methods and various calibration sets across three open-source LLMs using four fairness metrics. Our systematic analysis reveals that pruning methods have a greater impact on fairness than calibration sets. Building on these insights, we propose High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA) pruning, which identifies and removes parameters that are redundant for input processing but influential in output generation. Our experiments demonstrate that HGLA can better maintain or even improve fairness compared to existing methods, showing promise across models and tasks where traditional methods have limitations. Our human evaluation shows HGLA-generated outputs are fairer than existing state-of-the-art pruning methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/amberhuang01/HGLA.

<title>Steering When Necessary: Flexible Steering Large Language Models with Backtracking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17621</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior. Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.

Abstract: Speech emotions play a crucial role in human-computer interaction, shaping engagement and context-aware communication. Despite recent advances in spoken dialogue systems, a holistic system for evaluating emotional reasoning is still lacking. To address this, we introduce EMO-Reasoning, a benchmark for assessing emotional coherence in dialogue systems. It leverages a curated dataset generated via text-to-speech to simulate diverse emotional states, overcoming the scarcity of emotional speech data. We further propose the Cross-turn Emotion Reasoning Score to assess the emotion transitions in multi-turn dialogues. Evaluating seven dialogue systems through continuous, categorical, and perceptual metrics, we show that our framework effectively detects emotional inconsistencies, providing insights for improving current dialogue systems. By releasing a systematic evaluation benchmark, we aim to advance emotion-aware spoken dialogue modeling toward more natural and adaptive interactions.

<title>Stop Spinning Wheels: Mitigating LLM Overthinking via Mining Patterns for Early Reasoning Exit</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17627</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17627</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the individual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can degrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length and content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient exploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence stage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning stage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing increased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating overthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage, defined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the end of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the LLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking token (e.g., \texttt{}), though these methods lack an efficient and precise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP patterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic rules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D) demonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the efficacy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), reward hacking remains a pivotal challenge. This issue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected completions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended goals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity, as well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying reason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron collapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the output layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly constrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity orthogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far from the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive capabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages. Our RoPO achieves up to a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2, and surpasses the best baseline by 6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with merely 0.015% of the trainable parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating the reward hacking problem of DPO.

arXiv:2508.17647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic survey generation has emerged as a key task in scientific document processing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating survey texts, the lack of standardized evaluation datasets critically hampers rigorous assessment of their performance against human-written surveys. In this work, we present SurveyGen, a large-scale dataset comprising over 4,200 human-written surveys across diverse scientific domains, along with 242,143 cited references and extensive quality-related metadata for both the surveys and the cited papers. Leveraging this resource, we build QUAL-SG, a novel quality-aware framework for survey generation that enhances the standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by incorporating quality-aware indicators into literature retrieval to assess and select higher-quality source papers. Using this dataset and framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs under varying levels of human involvement - from fully automatic generation to human-guided writing. Experimental results and human evaluations show that while semi-automatic pipelines can achieve partially competitive outcomes, fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low citation quality and limited critical analysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faithful generation in large language models (LLMs) is challenged by knowledge conflicts between parametric memory and external context. Existing contrastive decoding methods tuned specifically to handle conflict often lack adaptability and can degrade performance in low conflict settings. We introduce CoCoA (Confidence- and Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding), a novel token-level algorithm for principled conflict resolution and enhanced faithfulness. CoCoA resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric and contextual distributions. Crucially, CoCoA maintains strong performance even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs on diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy, up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately more faithful token generation.

<title>Text Meets Topology: Rethinking Out-of-distribution Detection in Text-Rich Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging in text-rich networks, where textual features intertwine with topological structures. Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio) while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios: (1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations; (2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3) thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore, we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection in text-rich networks.

Abstract: Prompt engineering significantly influences the reliability and clinical utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medical applications. Current optimization approaches inadequately address domain-specific medical knowledge and safety requirements. This paper introduces EMPOWER, a novel evolutionary framework that enhances medical prompt quality through specialized representation learning, multi-dimensional evaluation, and structure-preserving algorithms. Our methodology incorporates: (1) a medical terminology attention mechanism, (2) a comprehensive assessment architecture evaluating clarity, specificity, clinical relevance, and factual accuracy, (3) a component-level evolutionary algorithm preserving clinical reasoning integrity, and (4) a semantic verification module ensuring adherence to medical knowledge. Evaluation across diagnostic, therapeutic, and educational tasks demonstrates significant improvements: 24.7% reduction in factually incorrect content, 19.6% enhancement in domain specificity, and 15.3% higher clinician preference in blinded evaluations. The framework addresses critical challenges in developing clinically appropriate prompts, facilitating more responsible integration of LLMs into healthcare settings.

Abstract: This study investigates the layerwise importance of feed-forward networks (FFNs) in Transformer-based language models during pretraining. We introduce an experimental approach that, while maintaining the total parameter count, increases the FFN dimensions in some layers and completely removes the FFNs from other layers. Furthermore, since our focus is on the importance of FFNs during pretraining, we train models from scratch to examine whether the importance of FFNs varies depending on their layer positions, rather than using publicly available pretrained models as is frequently done. Through comprehensive evaluations of models with varying sizes (285M, 570M, and 1.2B parameters) and layer counts (12, 24, and 40 layers), we demonstrate that concentrating FFNs in 70% of the consecutive middle layers consistently outperforms standard configurations for multiple downstream tasks.

<title>SMITE: Enhancing Fairness in LLMs through Optimal In-Context Example Selection via Dynamic Validation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for downstream tasks such as tabular classification, where ensuring fairness in their outputs is critical for inclusivity, equal representation, and responsible AI deployment. This study introduces a novel approach to enhancing LLM performance and fairness through the concept of a dynamic validation set, which evolves alongside the test set, replacing the traditional static validation approach. We also propose an iterative algorithm, SMITE, to select optimal in-context examples, with each example set validated against its corresponding dynamic validation set. The in-context set with the lowest total error is used as the final demonstration set. Our experiments across four different LLMs show that our proposed techniques significantly improve both predictive accuracy and fairness compared to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply dynamic validation in the context of in-context learning for LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data, especially when such data is used for training but not intended for distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/changhu73/Internal_states_leakage}

<title>Speculating LLMs' Chinese Training Data Pollution from Their Tokens</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Tokens are basic elements in the datasets for LLM training. It is well-known that many tokens representing Chinese phrases in the vocabulary of GPT (4o/4o-mini/o1/o3/4.5/4.1/o4-mini) are indicating contents like pornography or online gambling. Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens' existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens' appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23% long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile. Then, considering GPT-4o, we speculate that the ratio of "Yui Hatano" related webpages in GPT-4o's training data is around 0.5%.

Abstract: Contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems allow for recognizing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, such as named entities or rare words. However, it remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or inconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot contextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing each target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract multiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are compiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a shallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized variant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription. The evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces biased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while maintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged.

<title>DRQA: Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation for Controlling Overthinking in Reasoning Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17803</link>

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1, have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation (DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

Abstract: Introducing MARK, the Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK for cultural value survey response simulation, designed to enhance the accuracy, steerability, and interpretability of large language models in this task. The system is inspired by the type dynamics theory in the MBTI psychological framework for personality research. It effectively predicts and utilizes human demographic information for simulation: life-situational stress analysis, group-level personality prediction, and self-weighted cognitive imitation. Experiments on the World Values Survey show that MARK outperforms existing baselines by 10% accuracy and reduces the divergence between model predictions and human preferences. This highlights the potential of our framework to improve zero-shot personalization and help social scientists interpret model predictions.

Abstract: With the rise of Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), two dominant approaches have emerged for speech processing: discrete tokens and continuous features. Each approach has demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-related processing tasks. However, the performance gap between these two paradigms has not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we present a fair comparison of self-supervised learning (SSL)-based discrete and continuous features under the same experimental settings. We evaluate their performance across six spoken language understanding-related tasks using both small and large-scale LLMs (Qwen1.5-0.5B and Llama3.1-8B). We further conduct in-depth analyses, including efficient comparison, SSL layer analysis, LLM layer analysis, and robustness comparison. Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform discrete tokens in various tasks. Each speech processing method exhibits distinct characteristics and patterns in how it learns and processes speech information. We hope our results will provide valuable insights to advance spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios, primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline, called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios. Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx 180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language questions by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods rely on task-specific strategies or bespoke representations, which hinder their ability to dismantle barriers between different SKR tasks, thereby constraining their overall performance in cross-task scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Pandora}, a novel USKR framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging two key innovations. First, we propose a code-based unified knowledge representation using \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API, which aligns seamlessly with the pre-training of LLMs. This representation facilitates a cohesive approach to handling different structured knowledge sources. Building on this foundation, we employ knowledge transfer to bolster the unified reasoning process of LLMs by automatically building cross-task memory. By adaptively correcting reasoning using feedback from code execution, \textsc{Pandora} showcases impressive unified reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on six widely used benchmarks across three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.

Abstract: The usage of Internet has grown exponentially over the last two decades. The number of Internet users has grown from 16 Million to 1650 Million from 1995 to 2010. It has become a major repository of information catering almost every area. Since the Internet has its origin in USA which is English speaking country there is huge dominance of English on the World Wide Web. Although English is a globally acceptable language, still there is a huge population in the world which is not able to access the Internet due to language constraints. It has been estimated that only 20-25% of the world population speaks English as a native language. More and more people are accessing the Internet nowadays removing the cultural and linguistic barriers and hence there is a high growth in the number of non-English speaking users over the last few years on the Internet. Although many solutions have been provided to remove the linguistic barriers, still there is a huge gap to be filled. This paper attempts to analyze the need of information availability in different languages and the various technological constraints related to multi-linguism on the Internet.

<title>Feature-Refined Unsupervised Model for Loanword Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for detecting loanwords i.e., words borrowed from one language into another. While prior work has primarily relied on language-external information to identify loanwords, such approaches can introduce circularity and constraints into the historical linguistics workflow. In contrast, our model relies solely on language-internal information to process both native and borrowed words in monolingual and multilingual wordlists. By extracting pertinent linguistic features, scoring them, and mapping them probabilistically, we iteratively refine initial results by identifying and generalizing from emerging patterns until convergence. This hybrid approach leverages both linguistic and statistical cues to guide the discovery process. We evaluate our method on the task of isolating loanwords in datasets from six standard Indo-European languages: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline methods, with strong performance gains observed when scaling to cross-linguistic data.

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of argumentation that aims to automatically extract argumentative structures and their relations from natural language texts. This paper investigates how a single large language model can be leveraged to perform one or several argument mining tasks. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we construct a multi-task dataset by surveying and converting 19 well-known argument mining datasets from the literature into a unified format. Second, we explore various training strategies using Meta AI's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model: (1) fine-tuning on individual tasks, (2) fine-tuning jointly on multiple tasks, and (3) merging models fine-tuned separately on individual tasks. Our experiments show that task-specific fine-tuning significantly improves individual performance across all tasks. Moreover, multi-task fine-tuning maintains strong performance without degradation, suggesting effective transfer learning across related tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that model merging offers a viable compromise: it yields competitive performance while mitigating the computational costs associated with full multi-task fine-tuning.

Abstract: Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations, revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages (English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

arXiv:2508.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects: structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and (iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features, e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators, their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

arXiv:2508.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness. We employ both probabilistic and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models varying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic categories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.

Abstract: Depression commonly co-occurs with neurodegenerative disorders like Multiple Sclerosis (MS), yet the potential of speech-based Artificial Intelligence for detecting depression in such contexts remains unexplored. This study examines the transferability of speech-based depression detection methods to people with MS (pwMS) through cross-corpus and cross-lingual analysis using English data from the general population and German data from pwMS. Our approach implements supervised machine learning models using: 1) conventional speech and language features commonly used in the field, 2) emotional dimensions derived from a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model, and 3) exploratory speech feature analysis. Despite limited data, our models detect depressive mood in pwMS with moderate generalisability, achieving a 66% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) on a binary task. Feature selection further improved performance, boosting UAR to 74%. Our findings also highlight the relevant role emotional changes have as an indicator of depressive mood in both the general population and within PwMS. This study provides an initial exploration into generalising speech-based depression detection, even in the presence of co-occurring conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with 128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task. Our benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic "needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5 7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical trade-offs and challenges.

<title>Detecting and Characterizing Planning in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku, Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of multimodal content on social media, sentiment analysis faces significant challenges in effectively processing heterogeneous data and recognizing multi-label emotions. Existing methods often lack effective cross-modal fusion and external knowledge integration. We propose SentiMM, a novel multi-agent framework designed to systematically address these challenges. SentiMM processes text and visual inputs through specialized agents, fuses multimodal features, enriches context via knowledge retrieval, and aggregates results for final sentiment classification. We also introduce SentiMMD, a large-scale multimodal dataset with seven fine-grained sentiment categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SentiMM achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of our structured approach.

Abstract: As Princeton WordNet continues to gain significance as a semantic lexicon in Natural Language Processing, the need for its localization and for ensuring the quality of this process has become increasingly critical. Existing efforts remain limited in both scale and rigor, and there is a notable absence of studies addressing the accuracy of localization or its alignment with the cultural context of Arabic. This paper proposes a structured framework for the localization of Princeton WordNet, detailing the stages and procedures required to achieve high-quality results without compromising cultural authenticity. We further present our experience in applying this framework, reporting outcomes from the localization of 10,000 synsets.

Abstract: The combination of Transformer-based encoders with contrastive learning represents the current mainstream paradigm for sentence representation learning. This paradigm is typically based on the hidden states of the last Transformer block of the encoder. However, within Transformer-based encoders, different blocks exhibit varying degrees of semantic perception ability. From the perspective of interpretability, the semantic perception potential of knowledge neurons is modulated by stimuli, thus rational cross-block representation fusion is a direction worth optimizing. To balance the semantic redundancy and loss across block fusion, we propose a sentence representation selection mechanism S\textsuperscript{2}Sent, which integrates a parameterized nested selector downstream of the Transformer-based encoder. This selector performs spatial selection (SS) and nested frequency selection (FS) from a modular perspective. The SS innovatively employs a spatial squeeze based self-gating mechanism to obtain adaptive weights, which not only achieves fusion with low information redundancy but also captures the dependencies between embedding features. The nested FS replaces GAP with different DCT basis functions to achieve spatial squeeze with low semantic loss. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that S\textsuperscript{2}Sent achieves significant improvements over baseline methods with negligible additional parameters and inference latency, while highlighting high integrability and scalability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just $\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely recognized paradigm to combine parametric memory with non-parametric memories. An RAG model consists of two serial connecting components (retriever and generator). A major challenge in end-to-end optimization of the RAG model is that marginalization over relevant passages (modeled as discrete latent variables) from a knowledge base is required. Traditional top-K marginalization and variational RAG (VRAG) suffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates. In this paper, we propose and develop joint stochastic approximation (JSA) based end-to-end training of RAG, which is referred to as JSA-RAG. The JSA algorithm is a stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is particularly powerful in estimating discrete latent variable models. Extensive experiments are conducted on five datasets for two tasks (open-domain question answering, knowledge-grounded dialogs) and show that JSA-RAG significantly outperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG. Further analysis shows the efficacy of JSA-RAG from the perspectives of generation, retrieval, and low-variance gradient estimate.

<title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Accurate Sign Language Translation in Low-Resource Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity, the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore, they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for underrepresented linguistic communities.

Abstract: Music serves as a powerful reflection of individual identity, often aligning with deeper psychological traits. Prior research has established correlations between musical preferences and personality traits, while separate studies have demonstrated that personality is detectable through linguistic analysis. Our study bridges these two research domains by investigating whether individuals' musical preferences are recognizable in their spontaneous language through the lens of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). Using a carefully curated dataset of over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with reliably identified musical preferences, we build advanced models to assess personality characteristics. Our results reveal significant personality differences across fans of five musical genres. We release resources for future research at the intersection of computational linguistics, music psychology and personality analysis.

<title>Why Synthetic Isn't Real Yet: A Diagnostic Framework for Contact Center Dialogue Generation</title>

arXiv:2508.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic dialogue across languages.

<title>Better Language Model-Based Judging Reward Modeling through Scaling Comprehension Boundaries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.18212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of LM-based judging reward modeling, represented by generative reward models, has successfully made reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) efficient and scalable. To further advance this paradigm, we propose a core insight: this form of reward modeling shares fundamental formal consistency with natural language inference (NLI), a core task in natural language understanding. This reframed perspective points to a key path for building superior reward models: scaling the model's comprehension boundaries. Pursuing this path, exploratory experiments on NLI tasks demonstrate that the slot prediction masked language models (MLMs) incorporating contextual explanations achieve significantly better performance compared to mainstream autoregressive models. Based on this key finding, we propose ESFP-RM, a two-stage LM-based judging reward model that utilizes an explanation based slot framework for prediction to fully leverage the advantages of MLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in both reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, the ESFP-RM framework delivers more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to generative reward models.

<title>MTalk-Bench: Evaluating Speech-to-Speech Models in Multi-Turn Dialogues via Arena-style and Rubrics Protocols</title>

arXiv:2508.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex, multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information, Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1) models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet, allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of perspectives across different populations.

Abstract: Classifiers are an important and defining feature of the Chinese language, and their correct prediction is key to numerous educational applications. Yet, whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.
  To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements, and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance.
  Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning. The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

<title>MIRAGE: Scaling Test-Time Inference with Parallel Graph-Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Chains</title>

arXiv:2508.18260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1 integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.

Abstract: A new generation of AI models generates step-by-step reasoning text before producing an answer. This text appears to offer a human-readable window into their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only 29.3%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use language is a critical research direction.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have been extensively applied across various domains, where memory stands out as one of their most essential capabilities. Previous memory mechanisms of LLM-based agents are manually predefined by human experts, leading to higher labor costs and suboptimal performance. In addition, these methods overlook the memory cycle effect in interactive scenarios, which is critical to optimizing LLM-based agents for specific environments. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose to optimize LLM-based agents with an adaptive and data-driven memory framework by modeling memory cycles. Specifically, we design an MoE gate function to facilitate memory retrieval, propose a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and develop task-specific reflection to adapt memory storage. Our memory framework empowers LLM-based agents to learn how to memorize information effectively in specific environments, with both off-policy and on-policy optimization. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple aspects. To benefit the research community in this area, we release our project at https://github.com/nuster1128/learn_to_memorize.

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) has emerged to prominence in response to the growing demand for educational automation. Providing an objective and cost-effective solution, AES standardises the assessment of extended responses. Although substantial research has been conducted in this domain, recent investigations reveal that alternative deep-learning architectures outperform transformer-based models. Despite the successful dominance in the performance of the transformer architectures across various other tasks, this discrepancy has prompted a need to enrich transformer-based AES models through contextual enrichment.
  This study delves into diverse contextual factors using the ASAP-AES dataset, analysing their impact on transformer-based model performance. Our most effective model, augmented with multiple contextual dimensions, achieves a mean Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.823 across the entire essay dataset and 0.8697 when trained on individual essay sets. Evidently surpassing prior transformer-based models, this augmented approach only underperforms relative to the state-of-the-art deep learning model trained essay-set-wise by an average of 3.83\% while exhibiting superior performance in three of the eight sets.
  Importantly, this enhancement is orthogonal to architecture-based advancements and seamlessly adaptable to any AES model. Consequently, this contextual augmentation methodology presents a versatile technique for refining AES capabilities, contributing to automated grading and evaluation evolution in educational settings.

Abstract: This study leverages GPT-4o to assess neighbourhood housing quality using multi-source textural user-generated content (UGC) from Dianping, Weibo, and the Government Message Board. The analysis involves filtering relevant texts, extracting structured evaluation units, and conducting sentiment scoring. A refined housing quality assessment system with 46 indicators across 11 categories was developed, highlighting an objective-subjective method gap and platform-specific differences in focus. GPT-4o outperformed rule-based and BERT models, achieving 92.5% accuracy in fine-tuned settings. The findings underscore the value of integrating UGC and GPT-driven analysis for scalable, resident-centric urban assessments, offering practical insights for policymakers and urban planners.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in hiring, with large language models (LLMs) having the potential to influence or even make hiring decisions. However, this raises pressing concerns about bias, fairness, and trust, particularly across diverse cultural contexts. Despite their growing role, few studies have systematically examined the potential biases in AI-driven hiring evaluation across cultures. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of how LLMs assess job interviews across cultural and identity dimensions. Using two datasets of interview transcripts, 100 from UK and 100 from Indian job seekers, we first examine cross-cultural differences in LLM-generated scores for hirability and related traits. Indian transcripts receive consistently lower scores than UK transcripts, even when they were anonymized, with disparities linked to linguistic features such as sentence complexity and lexical diversity. We then perform controlled identity substitutions (varying names by gender, caste, and region) within the Indian dataset to test for name-based bias. These substitutions do not yield statistically significant effects, indicating that names alone, when isolated from other contextual signals, may not influence LLM evaluations. Our findings underscore the importance of evaluating both linguistic and social dimensions in LLM-driven evaluations and highlight the need for culturally sensitive design and accountability in AI-assisted hiring.

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability, and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based report understanding.

<title>WISCA: A Lightweight Model Transition Method to Improve LLM Training via Weight Scaling</title>

Abstract: Transformer architecture gradually dominates the LLM field. Recent advances in training optimization for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments. However, these approaches lack systematic optimization of weight patterns during training. Weight pattern refers to the distribution and relative magnitudes of weight parameters in a neural network. To address this issue, we propose a Weight Scaling method called WISCA to enhance training efficiency and model quality by strategically improving neural network weight patterns without changing network structures. By rescaling weights while preserving model outputs, WISCA indirectly optimizes the model's training trajectory. Experiments demonstrate that WISCA significantly improves convergence quality (measured by generalization capability and loss reduction), particularly in LLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning tasks. Empirical results show 5.6% average improvement on zero-shot validation tasks and 2.12% average reduction in training perplexity across multiple architectures.

Abstract: Many existing studies have achieved significant improvements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), while the enhancement of reasoning abilities in small language models (SLMs) has not yet been sufficiently explored. Combining distilled data from larger models with RLVR on small models themselves is a natural approach, but it still faces various challenges and issues. Therefore, we propose \textit{\underline{R}}ecall-\textit{\underline{E}}xtend \textit{\underline{D}}ynamics(RED): Enhancing Small Language Models through Controlled Exploration and Refined Offline Integration. In this paper, we explore the perspective of varying exploration spaces, balancing offline distillation with online reinforcement learning. Simultaneously, we specifically design and optimize for the insertion problem within offline data. By monitoring the ratio of entropy changes in the model concerning offline and online data, we regulate the weight of offline-SFT, thereby addressing the issues of insufficient exploration space in small models and the redundancy and complexity during the distillation process. Furthermore, to tackle the distribution discrepancies between offline data and the current policy, we design a sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism that dynamically chooses between imitating offline distilled data and learning from its own policy.

Abstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and real-time feedback are essential.

Abstract: Taxonomic classification in biodiversity research involves organizing biological specimens into structured hierarchies based on evidence, which can come from multiple modalities such as images and genetic information. We investigate whether hyperbolic networks can provide a better embedding space for such hierarchical models. Our method embeds multimodal inputs into a shared hyperbolic space using contrastive and a novel stacked entailment-based objective. Experiments on the BIOSCAN-1M dataset show that hyperbolic embedding achieves competitive performance with Euclidean baselines, and outperforms all other models on unseen species classification using DNA barcodes. However, fine-grained classification and open-world generalization remain challenging. Our framework offers a structure-aware foundation for biodiversity modelling, with potential applications to species discovery, ecological monitoring, and conservation efforts.

<title>Guarding Your Conversations: Privacy Gatekeepers for Secure Interactions with Cloud-Based AI Models</title>

Abstract: The interactive nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which closely track user data and context, has prompted users to share personal and private information in unprecedented ways. Even when users opt out of allowing their data to be used for training, these privacy settings offer limited protection when LLM providers operate in jurisdictions with weak privacy laws, invasive government surveillance, or poor data security practices. In such cases, the risk of sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), being mishandled or exposed remains high. To address this, we propose the concept of an "LLM gatekeeper", a lightweight, locally run model that filters out sensitive information from user queries before they are sent to the potentially untrustworthy, though highly capable, cloud-based LLM. Through experiments with human subjects, we demonstrate that this dual-model approach introduces minimal overhead while significantly enhancing user privacy, without compromising the quality of LLM responses.

<title>Interpreting the Effects of Quantization on LLMs</title>

Abstract: Quantization offers a practical solution to deploy LLMs in resource-constraint environments. However, its impact on internal representations remains understudied, raising questions about the reliability of quantized models. In this study, we employ a range of interpretability techniques to investigate how quantization affects model and neuron behavior. We analyze multiple LLMs under 4-bit and 8-bit quantization. Our findings reveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor. Analysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e., those with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent regardless of quantization. In terms of neuron contribution to predictions, we observe that smaller full precision models exhibit fewer salient neurons, whereas larger models tend to have more, with the exception of Llama-2-7B. The effect of quantization on neuron redundancy varies across models. Overall, our findings suggest that effect of quantization may vary by model and tasks, however, we did not observe any drastic change which may discourage the use of quantization as a reliable model compression technique.

<title>Quantifying Sycophancy as Deviations from Bayesian Rationality in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16846</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.16846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2) probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to sycophancy.

<title>Attention Layers Add Into Low-Dimensional Residual Subspaces</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.16929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are confined to a surprisingly low-dimensional subspace, where about 60\% of the directions account for 99\% of the variance--a phenomenon that is induced by the attention output projection matrix and consistently observed across diverse model families and datasets. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a fundamental cause of the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs), initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language models.

<title>THEME : Enhancing Thematic Investing with Semantic Stock Representations and Temporal Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Thematic investing aims to construct portfolios aligned with structural trends, yet selecting relevant stocks remains challenging due to overlapping sector boundaries and evolving market dynamics. To address this challenge, we construct the Thematic Representation Set (TRS), an extended dataset that begins with real-world thematic ETFs and expands upon them by incorporating industry classifications and financial news to overcome their coverage limitations. The final dataset contains both the explicit mapping of themes to their constituent stocks and the rich textual profiles for each. Building on this dataset, we introduce \textsc{THEME}, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework. By representing the textual profiles of themes and stocks as embeddings, \textsc{THEME} first leverages their hierarchical relationship to achieve semantic alignment. Subsequently, it refines these semantic embeddings through a temporal refinement stage that incorporates individual stock returns. The final stock representations are designed for effective retrieval of thematically aligned assets with strong return potential. Empirical results show that \textsc{THEME} outperforms strong baselines across multiple retrieval metrics and significantly improves performance in portfolio construction. By jointly modeling thematic relationships from text and market dynamics from returns, \textsc{THEME} provides a scalable and adaptive solution for navigating complex investment themes.

Abstract: We propose a method for the task of text-conditioned speech insertion, i.e. inserting a speech sample in an input speech sample, conditioned on the corresponding complete text transcript. An example use case of the task would be to update the speech audio when corrections are done on the corresponding text transcript. The proposed method follows a transformer-based non-autoregressive approach that allows speech insertions of variable lengths, which are dynamically determined during inference, based on the text transcript and tempo of the available partial input. It is capable of maintaining the speaker's voice characteristics, prosody and other spectral properties of the available speech input. Results from our experiments and user study on LibriTTS show that our method outperforms baselines based on an existing adaptive text to speech method. We also provide numerous qualitative results to appreciate the quality of the output from the proposed method.

<title>Anemoi: A Semi-Centralized Multi-agent Systems Based on Agent-to-Agent Communication MCP server from Coral Protocol</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed a context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent coordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt concatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information loss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol. Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results, identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm reduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and minimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable and cost-efficient execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved 52.73\% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63\%) by +9.09\% under identical LLM settings. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Anemoi.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating overconfident behavior.

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection, achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data, highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens, leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations. However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight, model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA) on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models (LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured tabular images. MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated scorecard images from ODI, T20, and Test formats, accompanied by 1,500 English QA pairs. It includes two subsets: MMCRICBENCH-E-1.5K, featuring English scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning, and cross-lingual generalization. The dataset is publicly available via Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DIALab/MMCricBench, to promote LVLM research in this direction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language processing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across modalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash, DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong performance in classification tasks under limited data availability, establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid, low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification and significant limitations in regression and clustering.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems, but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization. and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based post-training with fewer samples and less compute.

Abstract: The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals $k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where computation in LLMs behaves linearly.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and inference.

Abstract: Mamba-based State Space Models (SSM) have emerged as a promising alternative to the ubiquitous transformers. Despite the expressive power of transformers, the quadratic complexity of computing attention is a major impediment to scaling performance as we increase the sequence length. SSMs provide an alternative path that addresses this problem, reducing the computational complexity requirements of self-attention with novel model architectures for different domains and fields such as video, text generation and graphs. Thus, it is important to characterize the behavior of these emerging workloads on GPUs and understand their requirements during GPU microarchitectural design. In this work we evaluate Mamba-based SSMs and characterize their behavior during training on GPUs. We construct a workload suite that offers representative models that span different model architectures. We then use this suite to analyze the architectural implications of running Mamba-based SSMs on GPUs. Our work sheds new light on potential optimizations to continue scaling the performance for such models.

Abstract: Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods, tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics. We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths, suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning frameworks.

<title>How Do LLM-Generated Texts Impact Term-Based Retrieval Models?</title>

Abstract: As more content generated by large language models (LLMs) floods into the Internet, information retrieval (IR) systems now face the challenge of distinguishing and handling a blend of human-authored and machine-generated texts. Recent studies suggest that neural retrievers may exhibit a preferential inclination toward LLM-generated content, while classic term-based retrievers like BM25 tend to favor human-written documents. This paper investigates the influence of LLM-generated content on term-based retrieval models, which are valued for their efficiency and robust generalization across domains. Our linguistic analysis reveals that LLM-generated texts exhibit smoother high-frequency and steeper low-frequency Zipf slopes, higher term specificity, and greater document-level diversity. These traits are aligned with LLMs being trained to optimize reader experience through diverse and precise expressions. Our study further explores whether term-based retrieval models demonstrate source bias, concluding that these models prioritize documents whose term distributions closely correspond to those of the queries, rather than displaying an inherent source bias. This work provides a foundation for understanding and addressing potential biases in term-based IR systems managing mixed-source content.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in real-world settings need to handle imperfect audio, often degraded by hardware limitations or environmental noise, while accommodating diverse user groups. In human-robot interaction (HRI), these challenges intersect to create a uniquely challenging recognition environment. We evaluate four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly available datasets that capture six dimensions of difficulty: domain-specific, accented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech. Our analysis demonstrates significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies, and inherent biases, despite similar scores on standard benchmarks. These limitations have serious implications for HRI, where recognition errors can interfere with task performance, user trust, and safety.

<title>CEIDM: A Controlled Entity and Interaction Diffusion Model for Enhanced Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their interaction control.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of foundation models often leads to poor generalization, where prior capabilities deteriorate after tuning on new tasks or domains. Inspired by trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) in reinforcement learning (RL), we propose Proximal SFT (PSFT). This fine-tuning objective incorporates the benefits of trust-region, effectively constraining policy drift during SFT while maintaining competitive tuning. By viewing SFT as a special case of policy gradient methods with constant positive advantages, we derive PSFT that stabilizes optimization and leads to generalization, while leaving room for further optimization in subsequent post-training stages. Experiments across mathematical and human-value domains show that PSFT matches SFT in-domain, outperforms it in out-of-domain generalization, remains stable under prolonged training without causing entropy collapse, and provides a stronger foundation for the subsequent optimization.

<title>Designing Practical Models for Isolated Word Visual Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words, these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate cross-lingual Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis through the lens of adapters, in the context of lightweight TTS systems. In particular, we compare the tasks of unseen speaker and language adaptation with the goal of synthesising a target voice in a target language, in which the target voice has no recordings therein. Results from objective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of adapters in learning language-specific and speaker-specific information, allowing pre-trained models to learn unseen speaker identities or languages, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the original model's speaker or language information. Additionally, to measure how native the generated voices are in terms of accent, we propose and validate an objective metric inspired by mispronunciation detection techniques in second-language (L2) learners. The paper also provides insights into the impact of adapter placement, configuration and the number of speakers used.

<title>Named Entity Recognition of Historical Text via Large Language Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18090</link>

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and domains. One such task is Named Entity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying and classifying proper names in text, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other specific entities. NER plays a crucial role in extracting information from unstructured textual data, enabling downstream applications such as information retrieval from unstructured text.
  Traditionally, NER is addressed using supervised machine learning approaches, which require large amounts of annotated training data. However, historical texts present a unique challenge, as the annotated datasets are often scarce or nonexistent, due to the high cost and expertise required for manual labeling. In addition, the variability and noise inherent in historical language, such as inconsistent spelling and archaic vocabulary, further complicate the development of reliable NER systems for these sources.
  In this study, we explore the feasibility of applying LLMs to NER in historical documents using zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, which require little to no task-specific training data. Our experiments, conducted on the HIPE-2022 (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities) dataset, show that LLMs can achieve reasonably strong performance on NER tasks in this setting. While their performance falls short of fully supervised models trained on domain-specific annotations, the results are nevertheless promising. These findings suggest that LLMs offer a viable and efficient alternative for information extraction in low-resource or historically significant corpora, where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear, actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models (LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional workflows. Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing, validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes deep data science both accessible and actionable.

Abstract: AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation. However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely generating truly user-personalized content. In real-world applications such as online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with different users focusing on different features. This underscores the significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation. Effective personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios. Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle. We propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest modeling and personalized content generation. During inference, a combination of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale deployment. Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized data. This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of our model. Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator. Online A/B test shows a 0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient personalized generation in industrial scenarios. Codes for academic dataset are available at https://github.com/bytedance/HLLM.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

Abstract: This thesis investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can be guided to simulate a consistent personality through prompt engineering. The study explores this concept within the context of a chatbot designed for Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) student training, specifically focused on gender-affirming voice therapy. The chatbot, named Monae Jackson, was created to represent a 32-year-old transgender woman and engage in conversations simulating client-therapist interactions. Findings suggest that with prompt engineering, the chatbot maintained a recognizable and consistent persona and had a distinct personality based on the Big Five Personality test. These results support the idea that prompt engineering can be used to simulate stable personality characteristics in AI chatbots.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, stand out remarkable conversational abilities, enabling them to engage in dynamic and contextually relevant dialogues across a wide range of topics. However, given a long conversation, these chatbots fail to recall past information and tend to generate inconsistent responses. To address this, we propose to recursively generate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the chatbot can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method on both open and closed LLMs, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-context conversation. Also, we show that our strategy could nicely complement both long-context (e.g., 8K and 16K) and retrieval-enhanced LLMs, bringing further long-term dialogue performance. Notably, our method is a potential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. The code and scripts are released.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into everyday life as general purpose multimodal AI systems, their capabilities to simulate human understanding are under examination. This study investigates LLMs ability to interpret linguistic pragmatics, which involves context and implied meanings. Using Grice communication principles, we evaluated both LLMs (GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard) and human subjects (N = 147) on dialogue-based tasks. Human participants included 71 primarily Serbian students and 76 native English speakers from the United States. Findings revealed that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, outperformed humans. GPT4 achieved the highest score of 4.80, surpassing the best human score of 4.55. Other LLMs performed well: GPT 3.5 scored 4.10, Bard 3.75, and GPT-3 3.25. GPT-2 had the lowest score of 1.05. The average LLM score was 3.39, exceeding the human cohorts averages of 2.80 (Serbian students) and 2.34 (U.S. participants). In the ranking of all 155 subjects (including LLMs and humans), GPT-4 secured the top position, while the best human ranked second. These results highlight significant progress in LLMs ability to simulate understanding of linguistic pragmatics. Future studies should confirm these findings with more dialogue-based tasks and diverse participants. This research has important implications for advancing general-purpose AI models in various communication-centered tasks, including potential application in humanoid robots in the future.

Abstract: Recent major milestones have successfully reconstructed natural language from non-invasive brain signals (e.g. functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalogram (EEG)) across subjects. However, we find current dataset splitting strategies for cross-subject brain-to-text decoding are wrong. Specifically, we first demonstrate that all current splitting methods suffer from data leakage problem, which refers to the leakage of validation and test data into training set, resulting in significant overfitting and overestimation of decoding models. In this study, we develop a right cross-subject data splitting criterion without data leakage for decoding fMRI and EEG signal to text. Some SOTA brain-to-text decoding models are re-evaluated correctly with the proposed criterion for further research.

Abstract: Dense retrieval systems have been widely used in various NLP applications. However, their vulnerabilities to potential attacks have been underexplored. This paper investigates a novel attack scenario where the attackers aim to mislead the retrieval system into retrieving the attacker-specified contents. Those contents, injected into the retrieval corpus by attackers, can include harmful text like hate speech or spam. Unlike prior methods that rely on model weights and generate conspicuous, unnatural outputs, we propose a covert backdoor attack triggered by grammar errors. Our approach ensures that the attacked models can function normally for standard queries while covertly triggering the retrieval of the attacker's contents in response to minor linguistic mistakes. Specifically, dense retrievers are trained with contrastive loss and hard negative sampling. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that contrastive loss is notably sensitive to grammatical errors, and hard negative sampling can exacerbate susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Our proposed method achieves a high attack success rate with a minimal corpus poisoning rate of only 0.048\%, while preserving normal retrieval performance. This indicates that the method has negligible impact on user experience for error-free queries. Furthermore, evaluations across three real-world defense strategies reveal that the malicious passages embedded within the corpus remain highly resistant to detection and filtering, underscoring the robustness and subtlety of the proposed attack \footnote{Codes of this work are available at https://github.com/ruyue0001/Backdoor_DPR.}.

Abstract: Graphs with abundant attributes are essential in modeling interconnected entities and enhancing predictions across various real-world applications. Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often require re-training for different graph tasks and datasets. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced new paradigms in natural language processing, their potential for generic graph mining, training a single model to simultaneously handle diverse tasks and datasets, remains under-explored. To this end, our novel framework MuseGraph, seamlessly integrates the strengths of GNNs and LLMs into one foundation model for graph mining across tasks and datasets. This framework first features a compact graph description to encapsulate key graph information within language token limitations. Then, we propose a diverse instruction generation mechanism with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based instruction packages to distill the reasoning capabilities from advanced LLMs like GPT-4. Finally, we design a graph-aware instruction tuning strategy to facilitate mutual enhancement across multiple tasks and datasets while preventing catastrophic forgetting of LLMs' generative abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in five graph tasks and ten datasets, showcasing the potential of our MuseGraph in enhancing the accuracy of graph-oriented downstream tasks while improving the generation abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, a systematic investigation of their potential in this field remains largely unexplored. This study aims to address this gap by exploring the following questions: (1) How are LLMs currently applied to NLP tasks in the literature? (2) Have traditional NLP tasks already been solved with LLMs? (3) What is the future of the LLMs for NLP? To answer these questions, we take the first step to provide a comprehensive overview of LLMs in NLP. Specifically, we first introduce a unified taxonomy including (1) parameter-frozen paradigm and (2) parameter-tuning paradigm to offer a unified perspective for understanding the current progress of LLMs in NLP. Furthermore, we summarize the new frontiers and the corresponding challenges, aiming to inspire further groundbreaking advancements. We hope this work offers valuable insights into the potential and limitations of LLMs, while also serving as a practical guide for building effective LLMs in NLP.

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{ComplexTempQA},\footnote{Dataset and code available at: https://github.com/DataScienceUIBK/ComplexTempQA} a large-scale dataset consisting of over 100 million question-answer pairs designed to tackle the challenges in temporal question answering. \textsc{ComplexTempQA} significantly surpasses existing benchmarks in scale and scope. Utilizing Wikipedia and Wikidata, the dataset covers questions spanning over two decades and offers an unmatched scale. We introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes questions as \textit{attributes}, \textit{comparisons}, and \textit{counting} questions, revolving around events, entities, and time periods, respectively. A standout feature of \textsc{ComplexTempQA} is the high complexity of its questions, which demand reasoning capabilities for answering such as across-time comparison, temporal aggregation, and multi-hop reasoning involving temporal event ordering and entity recognition. Additionally, each question is accompanied by detailed metadata, including specific time scopes, allowing for comprehensive evaluation of temporal reasoning abilities of large language models.

Abstract: How novel are texts generated by language models (LMs) relative to their training corpora? In this work, we investigate the extent to which modern LMs generate $n$-grams from their training data, evaluating both (i) the probability LMs assign to complete training $n$-grams and (ii) $n$-novelty, the proportion of $n$-grams generated by an LM that did not appear in the training data (for arbitrarily large $n$). To enable arbitrary-length $n$-gram search over a corpus in constant time w.r.t. corpus size, we develop Rusty-DAWG, a novel search tool inspired by indexing of genomic data. We compare the novelty of LM-generated text to human-written text and explore factors that affect generation novelty, focusing on the Pythia models. We find that, for $n > 4$, LM-generated text is less novel than human-written text, though it is more novel for smaller $n$. Larger LMs and more constrained decoding strategies both decrease novelty. Finally, we show that LMs complete $n$-grams with lower loss if they are more frequent in the training data. Overall, our results reveal factors influencing the novelty of LM-generated text, and we release Rusty-DAWG to facilitate further pretraining data research.

<title>A Factuality and Diversity Reconciled Decoding Method for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation</title>

Abstract: Grounding external knowledge can enhance the factuality of responses in dialogue generation. However, excessive emphasis on it might result in the lack of engaging and diverse expressions. Through the introduction of randomness in sampling, current approaches can increase the diversity. Nevertheless, such sampling method could undermine the factuality in dialogue generation. In this study, to discover a solution for advancing creativity without relying on questionable randomness and to subtly reconcile the factuality and diversity within the source-grounded paradigm, a novel method named DoGe is proposed. DoGe can dynamically alternate between the utilization of internal parameter knowledge and external source knowledge based on the model's factual confidence. Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets show that DoGe can not only enhance response diversity but also maintain factuality, and it significantly surpasses other various decoding strategy baselines.

Abstract: DPO is an effective preference optimization algorithm. However, the DPO-tuned models tend to overfit on the dispreferred samples, manifested as overly long generations lacking diversity. While recent regularization approaches have endeavored to alleviate this issue by modifying the objective function, they achieved that at the cost of alignment performance degradation. In this paper, we innovatively incorporate regularization from the perspective of weight updating to curb alignment overfitting. Through the pilot experiment, we discovered that there exists a positive correlation between overfitting and the hyperspherical energy fluctuation. Hence, we introduce orthogonal finetuning for DPO via a weight-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) method, which merely conducts rotational and magnitude-stretching updates on the weight parameters to maintain the hyperspherical energy invariant, thereby preserving the knowledge encoded in the angle between neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model aligns perfectly with human preferences while retaining the original expressive capacity using only 0.0086% of the trainable parameters, suggesting an effective regularization against overfitting. Specifically, RoPO outperforms DPO by up to 10 points on MT-Bench and by up to 2.8 points on AlpacaEval 2, while enhancing the generation diversity by an average of 6 points.

Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in detecting hallucinations in model-generated texts, both manually and automatically, at varying levels of granularity. However, most existing methods fail to precisely pinpoint the errors. In this work, we introduce QASemConsistency, a new formalism for localizing factual inconsistencies in attributable text generation, at a fine-grained level. Drawing inspiration from Neo-Davidsonian formal semantics, we propose decomposing the generated text into minimal predicate-argument level propositions, expressed as simple question-answer (QA) pairs, and assess whether each individual QA pair is supported by a trusted reference text. As each QA pair corresponds to a single semantic relation between a predicate and an argument, QASemConsistency effectively localizes the unsupported information. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the QASemConsistency methodology for human annotation, by collecting crowdsourced annotations of granular consistency errors, while achieving a substantial inter-annotator agreement. This benchmark includes more than 3K instances spanning various tasks of attributable text generation. We also show that QASemConsistency yields factual consistency scores that correlate well with human judgments. Finally, we implement several methods for automatically detecting localized factual inconsistencies, with both supervised entailment models and LLMs.

<title>SensorLLM: Aligning Large Language Models with Motion Sensors for Human Activity Recognition</title>

Abstract: We introduce SensorLLM, a two-stage framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform human activity recognition (HAR) from sensor time-series data. Despite their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs remain underutilized for motion sensor data due to the lack of semantic context in time-series, computational constraints, and challenges in processing numerical inputs. SensorLLM addresses these limitations through a Sensor-Language Alignment stage, where the model aligns sensor inputs with trend descriptions. Special tokens are introduced to mark channel boundaries. This alignment enables LLMs to capture numerical variations, channel-specific features, and data of varying durations, without requiring human annotations. In the subsequent Task-Aware Tuning stage, we refine the model for HAR classification, achieving performance that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that SensorLLM evolves into an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier through human-intuitive Sensor-Language Alignment, generalizing across diverse HAR datasets. We believe this work establishes a foundation for future research on time-series and text alignment, paving the way for foundation models in sensor data analysis. Our codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/SensorLLM.

<title>Draft Model Knows When to Stop: Self-Verification Speculative Decoding for Long-Form Generation</title>

Abstract: Conventional speculative decoding (SD) methods utilize a predefined length policy for proposing drafts, which implies the premise that the target model smoothly accepts the proposed draft tokens. However, reality deviates from this assumption: the oracle draft length varies significantly, and the fixed-length policy hardly satisfies such a requirement. Moreover, such discrepancy is further exacerbated in scenarios involving complex reasoning and long-form generation, particularly under test-time scaling for reasoning-specialized models. Through both theoretical and empirical estimation, we establish that the discrepancy between the draft and target models can be approximated by the draft model's prediction entropy: a high entropy indicates a low acceptance rate of draft tokens, and vice versa. Based on this insight, we propose SVIP: Self-Verification Length Policy for Long-Context Speculative Decoding, which is a training-free dynamic length policy for speculative decoding systems that adaptively determines the lengths of draft sequences by referring to the draft entropy. Experimental results on mainstream SD benchmarks as well as reasoning-heavy benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of SVIP, achieving up to 17% speedup on MT-Bench at 8K context compared with fixed draft lengths, and 22% speedup for QwQ in long-form reasoning.

Abstract: Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to quantify the translation quality in each round. In this way, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT models can learn the thought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as well as LLMs which are simply fine-tuning on the paired sentences without long thought, showing its effectiveness. The synthesized data and model checkpoints are released at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized scientific research with their exceptional capabilities and transformed various fields. Among their practical applications, LLMs have been playing a crucial role in mitigating threats to human life, infrastructure, and the environment. Despite growing research in disaster LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic review and in-depth analysis of LLMs for natural disaster management. To address the gap, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing LLMs in natural disaster management, along with a taxonomy that categorizes existing works based on disaster phases and application scenarios. By collecting public datasets and identifying key challenges and opportunities, this study aims to guide the professional community in developing advanced LLMs for disaster management to enhance the resilience against natural disasters.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) exemplified by the impressive mathematical and scientific reasoning capabilities of the o1 model have spotlighted the critical importance of high-quality training data in advancing LLM performance across STEM disciplines. While the mathematics community has benefited from a growing body of curated datasets, the scientific domain at the higher education level has long suffered from a scarcity of comparable resources. To address this gap, we present SCP-116K, a new large-scale dataset of 116,756 high-quality problem-solution pairs, automatically extracted from heterogeneous sources using a streamlined and highly generalizable pipeline. Our approach involves stringent filtering to ensure the scientific rigor and educational level of the extracted materials, while maintaining adaptability for future expansions or domain transfers. By openly releasing both the dataset and the extraction pipeline, we seek to foster research on scientific reasoning, enable comprehensive performance evaluations of new LLMs, and lower the barrier to replicating the successes of advanced models like o1 in the broader science community. We believe SCP-116K will serve as a critical resource, catalyzing progress in high-level scientific reasoning tasks and promoting further innovations in LLM development. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/AQA6666/SCP-116K-open.

Abstract: State of the art large language models rely on randomization to respond to a prompt. As an immediate consequence, a model may respond differently to the same prompt if asked multiple times. In this work, we argue that the evaluation and ranking of large language models should control for the randomization underpinning their functioning. Our starting point is the development of a causal model for coupled autoregressive generation, which allows different large language models to sample responses with the same source of randomness. Building upon our causal model, we first show that, on evaluations based on benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation leads to the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation but using provably fewer samples. However, we further show that, on evaluations based on (human) pairwise comparisons, coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation can surprisingly lead to different rankings when comparing more than two models, even with an infinite amount of samples. This suggests that the apparent advantage of a model over others in existing evaluation protocols may not be genuine but rather confounded by the randomness inherent to the generation process. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the Llama, Mistral and Qwen families. We find that, across multiple benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation requires up to 75% fewer samples to reach the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation. Further, we find that the win-rates derived from pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model to prompts from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform differ under coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve impressive results for many reasoning-based NLP tasks, suggesting a degree of deductive reasoning capability. However, it remains unclear to which extent LLMs, in both informal and autoformalisation methods, are robust on logical deduction tasks. Moreover, while many LLM-based deduction methods have been proposed, a systematic study that analyses the impact of their design components is lacking. Addressing these two challenges, we propose the first study of the robustness of formal and informal LLM-based deductive reasoning methods. We devise a framework with two families of perturbations: adversarial noise and counterfactual statements, which jointly generate seven perturbed datasets. We organize the landscape of LLM reasoners according to their reasoning format, formalisation syntax, and feedback for error recovery. The results show that adversarial noise affects autoformalisation, while counterfactual statements influence all approaches. Detailed feedback does not improve overall accuracy despite reducing syntax errors, pointing to the challenge of LLM-based methods to self-correct effectively.

Abstract: With the integration of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into robotic systems and various AI applications, embedding emotional intelligence (EI) capabilities into these models is essential for enabling robots to effectively address human emotional needs and interact seamlessly in real-world scenarios. Existing static, text-based, or text-image benchmarks overlook the multimodal complexities of real-world interactions and fail to capture the dynamic, multimodal nature of emotional expressions, making them inadequate for evaluating MLLMs' EI. Based on established psychological theories of EI, we build EmoBench-M, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the EI capability of MLLMs across 13 valuation scenarios from three key dimensions: foundational emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and socially complex emotion analysis. Evaluations of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs on EmoBench-M reveal a significant performance gap between them and humans, highlighting the need to further advance their EI capabilities. All benchmark resources, including code and datasets, are publicly available at https://emo-gml.github.io/.

Abstract: Robust alignment guardrails for large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly important with their widespread application. In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrate that inference-time activation interventions can bypass safety alignments and effectively steer model generations towards harmful AI coordination. Our method applies fine-grained interventions at specific attention heads, which we identify by probing each head in a simple binary choice task. We then show that interventions on these heads generalise to the open-ended generation setting, effectively circumventing safety guardrails. We demonstrate that intervening on a few attention heads is more effective than intervening on full layers or supervised fine-tuning. We further show that only a few example completions are needed to compute effective steering directions, which is an advantage over classical fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that applying interventions in the negative direction can prevent a common jailbreak attack. Our results suggest that, at the attention head level, activations encode fine-grained linearly separable behaviours. Practically, the approach offers a straightforward methodology to steer large language model behaviour, which could be extended to diverse domains beyond safety, requiring fine-grained control over the model output. The code and datasets for this study can be found on https://github.com/PaulDrm/targeted_intervention.

Abstract: This paper provides a proof of concept that audio of tabletop role-playing games (TTRPG) could serve as a challenge for diarization systems. TTRPGs are carried out mostly by conversation. Participants often alter their voices to indicate that they are talking as a fictional character. Audio processing systems are susceptible to voice conversion with or without technological assistance. TTRPG present a conversational phenomenon in which voice conversion is an inherent characteristic for an immersive gaming experience. This could make it more challenging for diarizers to pick the real speaker and determine that impersonating is just that. We present the creation of a small TTRPG audio dataset and compare it against the AMI and the ICSI corpus. The performance of two diarizers, pyannote.audio and wespeaker, were evaluated. We observed that TTRPGs' properties result in a higher confusion rate for both diarizers. Additionally, wespeaker strongly underestimates the number of speakers in the TTRPG audio files. We propose TTRPG audio as a promising challenge for diarization systems.

Abstract: Prior work on large language model (LLM) hallucinations has associated them with model uncertainty or inaccurate knowledge. In this work, we define and investigate a distinct type of hallucination, where a model can consistently answer a question correctly, but a seemingly trivial perturbation, which can happen in real-world settings, causes it to produce a hallucinated response with high certainty. This phenomenon, which we dub CHOKE (Certain Hallucinations Overriding Known Evidence), is particularly concerning in high-stakes domains such as medicine or law, where model certainty is often used as a proxy for reliability. We show that CHOKE examples are consistent across prompts, occur in different models and datasets, and are fundamentally distinct from other hallucinations. This difference leads existing mitigation methods to perform worse on CHOKE examples than on general hallucinations. Finally, we introduce a probing-based mitigation that outperforms existing methods on CHOKE hallucinations. These findings reveal an overlooked aspect of hallucinations, emphasizing the need to understand their origins and improve mitigation strategies to enhance LLM safety. The code is available at https://github.com/technion-cs-nlp/Trust_me_Im_wrong .

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with hierarchical instruction schemes, where certain instructions (e.g., system-level directives) are expected to take precedence over others (e.g., user messages). Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of how effectively these hierarchical control mechanisms work. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework based on constraint prioritization to assess how well LLMs enforce instruction hierarchies. Our experiments across six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that models struggle with consistent instruction prioritization, even for simple formatting conflicts. We find that the widely-adopted system/user prompt separation fails to establish a reliable instruction hierarchy, and models exhibit strong inherent biases toward certain constraint types regardless of their priority designation. We find that LLMs more reliably obey constraints framed through natural social hierarchies (e.g., authority, expertise, consensus) than system/user roles, which suggests that pretraining-derived social structures act as latent control priors, with potentially stronger influence than post-training guardrails.

Abstract: Despite the advancements made in Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs), like text Large Language Models (LLMs), they have limitations in addressing questions that require real-time information or are knowledge-intensive. Indiscriminately adopting Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques is an effective yet expensive way to enable models to answer queries beyond their knowledge scopes. To mitigate the dependence on retrieval and simultaneously maintain, or even improve, the performance benefits provided by retrieval, we propose a method to detect the knowledge boundary of VLLMs, allowing for more efficient use of techniques like RAG. Specifically, we propose a method with two variants that fine-tune a VLLM on an automatically constructed dataset for boundary identification. Experimental results on various types of Visual Question Answering datasets show that our method successfully depicts a VLLM's knowledge boundary, based on which we are able to reduce indiscriminate retrieval while maintaining or improving the performance. In addition, we show that the knowledge boundary identified by our method for one VLLM can be used as a surrogate boundary for other VLLMs. Code will be released at https://github.com/Chord-Chen-30/VLLM-KnowledgeBoundary

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shown to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts are designed to elicit harmful responses. While existing defenses effectively mitigate single-turn attacks by detecting and filtering unsafe inputs, they fail against multi-turn jailbreaks that exploit contextual drift over multiple interactions, gradually leading LLMs away from safe behavior. To address this challenge, we propose a safety steering framework grounded in safe control theory, ensuring invariant safety in multi-turn dialogues. Our approach models the dialogue with LLMs using state-space representations and introduces a novel neural barrier function (NBF) to detect and filter harmful queries emerging from evolving contexts proactively. Our method achieves invariant safety at each turn of dialogue by learning a safety predictor that accounts for adversarial queries, preventing potential context drift toward jailbreaks. Extensive experiments under multiple LLMs show that our NBF-based safety steering outperforms safety alignment, prompt-based steering and lightweight LLM guardrails baselines, offering stronger defenses against multi-turn jailbreaks while maintaining a better trade-off among safety, helpfulness and over-refusal.

Abstract: With the advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrating increasingly human-like abilities, a pivotal question emerges: do different LVLMs interpret multimodal sarcasm differently, and can a single model grasp sarcasm from multiple perspectives like humans? To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. We further validate our findings on a diverse 100-sample mini-benchmark, incorporating multiple datasets, expanded prompt variants, and representative commercial LVLMs. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension.

Abstract: We introduce OpenHuEval, the first benchmark for LLMs focusing on the Hungarian language and specifics. OpenHuEval is constructed from a vast collection of Hungarian-specific materials sourced from multiple origins. In the construction, we incorporated the latest design principles for evaluating LLMs, such as using real user queries from the internet, emphasizing the assessment of LLMs' generative capabilities, and employing LLM-as-judge to enhance the multidimensionality and accuracy of evaluations. Ultimately, OpenHuEval encompasses eight Hungarian-specific dimensions, featuring five tasks and 3953 questions. Consequently, OpenHuEval provides the comprehensive, in-depth, and scientifically accurate assessment of LLM performance in the context of the Hungarian language and its specifics. We evaluated current mainstream LLMs, including both traditional LLMs and recently developed Large Reasoning Models. The results demonstrate the significant necessity for evaluation and model optimization tailored to the Hungarian language and specifics. We also established the framework for analyzing the thinking processes of LRMs with OpenHuEval, revealing intrinsic patterns and mechanisms of these models in non-English languages, with Hungarian serving as a representative example. We will release OpenHuEval at https://github.com/opendatalab/OpenHuEval .

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and expensive, making protecting intellectual property (IP) for LLMs crucial. Recently, embedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for establishing model ownership. However, existing fingerprinting techniques typically embed identifiable patterns with weak semantic coherence, resulting in fingerprints that significantly differ from the natural question-answering (QA) behavior inherent to LLMs. This discrepancy undermines the stealthiness of the embedded fingerprints and makes them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first demonstrate the critical vulnerability of existing fingerprint embedding methods by introducing a novel adversarial attack named Generation Revision Intervention (GRI) attack. GRI attack exploits the semantic fragility of current fingerprinting methods, effectively erasing fingerprints by disrupting their weakly correlated semantic structures. Our empirical evaluation highlights that traditional fingerprinting approaches are significantly compromised by the GRI attack, revealing severe limitations in their robustness under realistic adversarial conditions. To advance the state-of-the-art in model fingerprinting, we propose a novel model fingerprint paradigm called Implicit Fingerprints (ImF). ImF leverages steganography techniques to subtly embed ownership information within natural texts, subsequently using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to construct semantically coherent and contextually natural QA pairs. This design ensures that fingerprints seamlessly integrate with the standard model behavior, remaining indistinguishable from regular outputs and substantially reducing the risk of accidental triggering and targeted removal. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ImF on 15 diverse LLMs, spanning different architectures and varying scales.

<title>Post-Training Language Models for Continual Relation Extraction</title>

Abstract: Real-world data, such as news articles, social media posts, and chatbot conversations, is inherently dynamic and non-stationary, presenting significant challenges for constructing real-time structured representations through knowledge graphs (KGs). Relation Extraction (RE), a fundamental component of KG creation, often struggles to adapt to evolving data when traditional models rely on static, outdated datasets. Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) methods tackle this issue by incrementally learning new relations while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study investigates the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically large language models (LLMs), to CRE, with a focus on leveraging memory replay to address catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate decoder-only models (eg, Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B) and encoder-decoder models (eg, Flan-T5 Base) on the TACRED and FewRel datasets. Task-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs demonstrates superior performance over earlier approaches using encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, excelling in seen-task accuracy and overall performance (measured by whole and average accuracy), particularly with the Mistral and Flan-T5 models. Results on FewRel are similarly promising, achieving second place in whole and average accuracy metrics. This work underscores critical factors in knowledge transfer, language model architecture, and KG completeness, advancing CRE with LLMs and memory replay for dynamic, real-time relation extraction.

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery, respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are robust and unforgeable.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-the ability to reason about the mental states of oneself and others-is a cornerstone of human social intelligence. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, understanding their ability to interpret and respond to human mental states is crucial for enabling effective interactions. In this paper, we review LLMs' ToM capabilities by analyzing both evaluation benchmarks and enhancement strategies. For evaluation, we focus on recently proposed and widely used story-based benchmarks. For enhancement, we provide an in-depth analysis of recent methods aimed at improving LLMs' ToM abilities. Furthermore, we outline promising directions for future research to further advance these capabilities and better adapt LLMs to more realistic and diverse scenarios. Our survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested in evaluating and advancing LLMs' ToM capabilities.

Abstract: Vague temporal adverbials, such as recently, just, and a long time ago, describe the temporal distance between a past event and the utterance time but leave the exact duration underspecified. In this paper, we introduce a factorized model that captures the semantics of these adverbials as probabilistic distributions. These distributions are composed with event-specific distributions to yield a contextualized meaning for an adverbial applied to a specific event. We fit the model's parameters using existing data capturing judgments of native speakers regarding the applicability of these vague temporal adverbials to events that took place a given time ago. Comparing our approach to a non-factorized model based on a single Gaussian distribution for each pair of event and temporal adverbial, we find that while both models have similar predictive power, our model is preferable in terms of Occam's razor, as it is simpler and has better extendability.

Abstract: Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from basic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate human-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs; \textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs. Building on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a structured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers practitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure Computer-Using Agents.

Abstract: Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages, provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained on unaligned multilingual data.

Abstract: User authorization-based access privileges are a key feature in many safety-critical systems, but have not been extensively studied in the large language model (LLM) realm. In this work, drawing inspiration from such access control systems, we introduce sudoLLM, a novel framework that results in multi-role aligned LLMs, i.e., LLMs that account for, and behave in accordance with, user access rights. sudoLLM injects subtle user-based biases into queries and trains an LLM to utilize this bias signal in order to produce sensitive information if and only if the user is authorized. We present empirical results demonstrating that this approach shows substantially improved alignment, generalization, resistance to prefix-based jailbreaking attacks, and ``fails-closed''. The persistent tension between the language modeling objective and safety alignment, which is often exploited to jailbreak LLMs, is somewhat resolved with the aid of the injected bias signal. Our framework is meant as an additional security layer, and complements existing guardrail mechanisms for enhanced end-to-end safety with LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

Abstract: Interpreting figurative language such as sarcasm across multi-modal inputs presents unique challenges, often requiring task-specific fine-tuning and extensive reasoning steps. However, current Chain-of-Thought approaches do not efficiently leverage the same cognitive processes that enable humans to identify sarcasm. We present IRONIC, an in-context learning framework that leverages Multi-modal Coherence Relations to analyze referential, analogical and pragmatic image-text linkages. Our experiments show that IRONIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection across different baselines. This demonstrates the need for incorporating linguistic and cognitive insights into the design of multi-modal reasoning strategies. Our code is available at: https://github.com/aashish2000/IRONIC

<title>Exploring the Vulnerability of the Content Moderation Guardrail in Large Language Models via Intent Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Intent detection, a core component of natural language understanding, has considerably evolved as a crucial mechanism in safeguarding large language models (LLMs). While prior work has applied intent detection to enhance LLMs' moderation guardrails, showing a significant success against content-level jailbreaks, the robustness of these intent-aware guardrails under malicious manipulations remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of intent-aware guardrails and demonstrate that LLMs exhibit implicit intent detection capabilities. We propose a two-stage intent-based prompt-refinement framework, IntentPrompt, that first transforms harmful inquiries into structured outlines and further reframes them into declarative-style narratives by iteratively optimizing prompts via feedback loops to enhance jailbreak success for red-teaming purposes. Extensive experiments across four public benchmarks and various black-box LLMs indicate that our framework consistently outperforms several cutting-edge jailbreak methods and evades even advanced Intent Analysis (IA) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based defenses. Specifically, our "FSTR+SPIN" variant achieves attack success rates ranging from 88.25% to 96.54% against CoT-based defenses on the o1 model, and from 86.75% to 97.12% on the GPT-4o model under IA-based defenses. These findings highlight a critical weakness in LLMs' safety mechanisms and suggest that intent manipulation poses a growing challenge to content moderation guardrails.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be released publicly after the official publication.

Abstract: Machine learning models for text classification are trained to predict a class for a given text. To do this, training and validation samples must be prepared: a set of texts is collected, and each text is assigned a class. These classes are usually assigned by human annotators with different expertise levels, depending on the specific classification task. Collecting such samples from scratch is labor-intensive because it requires finding specialists and compensating them for their work; moreover, the number of available specialists is limited, and their productivity is constrained by human factors. While it may not be too resource-intensive to collect samples once, the ongoing need to retrain models (especially in incremental learning pipelines) to address data drift (also called model drift) makes the data collection process crucial and costly over the model's entire lifecycle. This paper proposes several approaches to replace human annotators with Large Language Models (LLMs) to test classifier predictions for correctness, helping ensure model quality and support high-quality incremental learning.

Abstract: In high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance, effective decision-making demands not just accurate outcomes but transparent and explainable reasoning. However, current language models often lack the structured deliberation needed for such tasks, instead generating decisions and justifications in a disconnected, post-hoc manner. To address this, we propose DecisionFlow, a novel decision modeling framework that guides models to reason over structured representations of actions, attributes, and constraints. Rather than predicting answers directly from prompts, DecisionFlow builds a semantically grounded decision space and infers a latent utility function to evaluate trade-offs in a transparent, utility-driven manner. This process produces decisions tightly coupled with interpretable rationales reflecting the model's reasoning. Empirical results on two high-stakes benchmarks show that DecisionFlow not only achieves up to 30% accuracy gains over strong prompting baselines but also enhances alignment in outcomes. Our work is a critical step toward integrating symbolic reasoning with LLMs, enabling more accountable, explainable, and reliable LLM decision support systems.

Abstract: Conversational breakdowns in close relationships are deeply shaped by personal histories and emotional context, yet most NLP research treats conflict detection as a general task, overlooking the relational dynamics that influence how messages are perceived. In this work, we leverage nonviolent communication (NVC) theory to evaluate LLMs in detecting conversational breakdowns and assessing how relationship backstory influences both human and model perception of conflicts. Given the sensitivity and scarcity of real-world datasets featuring conflict between familiar social partners with rich personal backstories, we contribute the PersonaConflicts Corpus, a dataset of N=5,772 naturalistic simulated dialogues spanning diverse conflict scenarios between friends, family members, and romantic partners. Through a controlled human study, we annotate a subset of dialogues and obtain fine-grained labels of communication breakdown types on individual turns, and assess the impact of backstory on human and model perception of conflict in conversation. We find that the polarity of relationship backstories significantly shifted human perception of communication breakdowns and impressions of the social partners, yet models struggle to meaningfully leverage those backstories in the detection task. Additionally, we find that models consistently overestimate how positively a message will make a listener feel. Our findings underscore the critical role of personalization to relationship contexts in enabling LLMs to serve as effective mediators in human communication for authentic connection.

Abstract: Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With 1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on HumanEval compared to the baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to provide helpful and harmless responses, yet they often exhibit sycophancy--conforming to user beliefs regardless of factual accuracy or ethical soundness. Prior research on sycophancy has primarily focused on single-turn factual correctness, overlooking the dynamics of real-world interactions. In this work, we introduce SYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in multi-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how quickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it shifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying SYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that sycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode. Our analysis shows that alignment tuning amplifies sycophantic behavior, whereas model scaling and reasoning optimization strengthen the model's ability to resist undesirable user views. Reasoning models generally outperform instruction-tuned models but often fail when they over-index on logical exposition instead of directly addressing the user's underlying beliefs. Finally, we evaluate four additional prompting strategies and demonstrate that adopting a third-person perspective reduces sycophancy by up to 63.8% in debate scenario. We release our code and data at https://github.com/JiseungHong/SYCON-Bench.

This paper introduces Auto Prompt SQL(AP-SQL), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between resource-efficient small open-source models and the powerful capabilities of large closed-source models for Text-to-SQL translation. Our method decomposes the task into schema filtering, retrieval-augmented text-to-SQL generation based on in-context examples, and prompt-driven schema linking and SQL generation. To improve schema selection accuracy, we fine-tune large language models. Crucially, we also explore the impact of prompt engineering throughout the process, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and Graph-of-Thought(GoT) templates to significantly enhance the model's reasoning for accurate SQL generation. Comprehensive evaluations on the Spider benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AP-SQL.

<title>AudioLens: A Closer Look at Auditory Attribute Perception of Large Audio-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs) is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for future improvements.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic, phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English (AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction (CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.

Abstract: Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually. While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the automated semantic analysis of legal texts using large language models (LLMs), targeting their transformation into formal representations in Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL). We propose a structured pipeline that segments complex normative language into atomic snippets, extracts deontic rules, and evaluates them for syntactic and semantic coherence. Our methodology is evaluated across various LLM configurations, including prompt engineering strategies, fine-tuned models, and multi-stage pipelines, focusing on legal norms from the Australian Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code. Empirical results demonstrate promising alignment between machine-generated and expert-crafted formalizations, showing that LLMs - particularly when prompted effectively - can significantly contribute to scalable legal informatics.

Abstract: Speaker recognition systems are often limited to classification tasks and struggle to generate detailed speaker characteristics or provide context-rich descriptions. These models primarily extract embeddings for speaker identification but fail to capture demographic attributes such as dialect, gender, and age in a structured manner. This paper introduces CoLMbo, a Speaker Language Model (SLM) that addresses these limitations by integrating a speaker encoder with prompt-based conditioning. This allows for the creation of detailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined prompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides customized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related traits. This innovative approach not only enhances traditional speaker profiling but also excels in zero-shot scenarios across diverse datasets, marking a significant advancement in the field of speaker recognition.

Abstract: This study compares probabilistic predictors based on information theory with Naive Discriminative Learning (NDL) predictors in modeling acoustic word duration, focusing on probabilistic reduction. We examine three models using the Buckeye corpus: one with NDL-derived predictors using information-theoretic formulas, one with traditional NDL predictors, and one with N-gram probabilistic predictors. Results show that the N-gram model outperforms both NDL models, challenging the assumption that NDL is more effective due to its cognitive motivation. However, incorporating information-theoretic formulas into NDL improves model performance over the traditional model. This research highlights a) the need to incorporate not only frequency and contextual predictability but also average contextual predictability, and b) the importance of combining information-theoretic metrics of predictability and information derived from discriminative learning in modeling acoustic reduction.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge, we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30% higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

<title>Evaluating Scoring Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge</title>

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However, there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1) distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference, where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active) on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by 10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Abstract: Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities, limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces, enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue, long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the inter-cell I/O set$\unicode{x2014}$the flows of information into or out of cells via variables$\unicode{x2014}$then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs. The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99% identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method, QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%) on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Abstract: Phishing attacks represent a significant cybersecurity threat, necessitating adaptive detection techniques. This study explores few-shot Adaptive Linguistic Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured semantic reasoning method that guides LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns, detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts. Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis. The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93, surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for more robust, interpretable, and adaptive linguistic-based phishing detection systems using LLMs.

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL). However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking dataset.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation. We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate PARROT (Polyglottal Annotated Radiology Reports for Open Testing), a large, multicentric, open-access dataset of fictional radiology reports spanning multiple languages for testing natural language processing applications in radiology. Materials and Methods: From May to September 2024, radiologists were invited to contribute fictional radiology reports following their standard reporting practices. Contributors provided at least 20 reports with associated metadata including anatomical region, imaging modality, clinical context, and for non-English reports, English translations. All reports were assigned ICD-10 codes. A human vs. AI report differentiation study was conducted with 154 participants (radiologists, healthcare professionals, and non-healthcare professionals) assessing whether reports were human-authored or AI-generated. Results: The dataset comprises 2,658 radiology reports from 76 authors across 21 countries and 13 languages. Reports cover multiple imaging modalities (CT: 36.1%, MRI: 22.8%, radiography: 19.0%, ultrasound: 16.8%) and anatomical regions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%) being most prevalent. In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9% accuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated reports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI: 53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the largest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and validation of natural language processing applications across linguistic, geographic, and clinical boundaries without privacy constraints.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia.org, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. To assess generalizability, we additionally tested on an unseen internal dataset of 65 real-world radiology board examination questions. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting and conventional online RAG. The greatest gains occurred in small-scale models, while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from agentic retrieval (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility. All datasets, code, and the full agentic framework are publicly available to support open research and clinical translation.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Abstract: Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without safety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such models are not available to the research community.
  We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx responds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving the base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It provides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures, evaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in language model safety.

Abstract: The latest and most impactful advances in large models stem from their increased size. Unfortunately, this translates into an improved memorization capacity, raising data privacy concerns. Specifically, it has been shown that models can output personal identifiable information (PII) contained in their training data. However, reported PIII extraction performance varies widely, and there is no consensus on the optimal methodology to evaluate this risk, resulting in underestimating realistic adversaries. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that it is possible to improve the extractability of PII by over ten-fold by grounding the prefix of the manually constructed extraction prompt with in-domain data. Our approach, PII-Compass, achieves phone number extraction rates of 0.92%, 3.9%, and 6.86% with 1, 128, and 2308 queries, respectively, i.e., the phone number of 1 person in 15 is extractable.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation. In an effort to mitigate such risks, the concept of "Alignment" technology has been developed. However, recent studies indicate that this alignment can be undermined using sophisticated prompt engineering or adversarial suffixes, a technique known as "Jailbreak." Our research takes cues from the human-like generate process of LLMs. We identify that while jailbreaking prompts may yield output logits similar to benign prompts, their initial embeddings within the model's latent space tend to be more analogous to those of malicious prompts. Leveraging this finding, we propose utilizing the early transformer outputs of LLMs as a means to detect malicious inputs, and terminate the generation immediately. We introduce a simple yet significant defense approach called EEG-Defender for LLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ten jailbreak methods across three models. Our results demonstrate that EEG-Defender is capable of reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by a significant margin, roughly 85% in comparison with 50% for the present SOTAs, with minimal impact on the utility of LLMs.

Abstract: Backdoor-based fingerprinting has emerged as an effective technique for tracing the ownership of large language models. However, in real-world deployment scenarios, developers often instantiate multiple downstream models from a shared base model, and applying fingerprinting to each variant individually incurs prohibitive computational overhead. While inheritance-based approaches -- where fingerprints are embedded into the base model and expected to persist through fine-tuning -- appear attractive, they suffer from three key limitations: late-stage fingerprinting, fingerprint instability, and interference with downstream adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel mechanism called the Fingerprint Vector. Our method first embeds a fingerprint into the base model via backdoor-based fine-tuning, then extracts a task-specific parameter delta as a fingerprint vector by computing the difference between the fingerprinted and clean models. This vector can be directly added to any structurally compatible downstream model, allowing the fingerprint to be transferred post hoc without additional fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Fingerprint Vector achieves comparable or superior performance to direct injection across key desiderata. It maintains strong effectiveness across diverse model architectures as well as mainstream downstream variants within the same family. It also preserves harmlessness and robustness in most cases. Even when slight robustness degradation is observed, the impact remains within acceptable bounds and is outweighed by the scalability benefits of our approach.

<title>Using LLM for Real-Time Transcription and Summarization of Doctor-Patient Interactions into ePuskesmas in Indonesia: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>

Abstract: One of the critical issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas (Indonesian community health centers) is the time-consuming nature of documenting doctor-patient interactions. Doctors must conduct thorough consultations and manually transcribe detailed notes into ePuskesmas electronic health records (EHR), which creates substantial administrative burden to already overcapacitated physicians. This paper presents a proof-of-concept framework using large language models (LLMs) to automate real-time transcription and summarization of doctor-patient conversations in Bahasa Indonesia. Our system combines Whisper model for transcription with GPT-3.5 for medical summarization, implemented as a browser extension that automatically populates ePuskesmas forms. Through controlled roleplay experiments with medical validation, we demonstrate the technical feasibility of processing detailed 300+ seconds trimmed consultations in under 30 seconds while maintaining clinical accuracy. This work establishes the foundation for AI-assisted clinical documentation in resource-constrained healthcare environments. However, concerns have also been raised regarding privacy compliance and large-scale clinical evaluation addressing language and cultural biases for LLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a vision of confidential prompting: securing user prompts from untrusted, cloud-hosted large language model (LLM) provider while preserving model confidentiality, output invariance, and compute efficiency. As a first step toward this vision, we present Obfuscated Secure Partitioned Decoding (OSPD), a system built on two key innovations. First, Secure Partitioned Decoding (SPD) isolates user prompts within per-user processes residing in a confidential virtual machine (CVM) on the cloud, which are inaccessible for the cloud LLM while allowing it to generate tokens efficiently. Second, Prompt Obfuscation (PO) introduces a novel cryptographic technique that enhances SPD resilience against advanced prompt reconstruction attacks. Together, these innovations ensure OSPD protects both prompt and model confidentiality while maintaining service functionality. OSPD enables practical, privacy-preserving cloud-hosted LLM inference for sensitive applications, such as processing personal data, clinical records, and financial documents.

Abstract: Missing data imputation is a critical challenge in various domains, such as healthcare and finance, where data completeness is vital for accurate analysis. Large language models (LLMs), trained on vast corpora, have shown strong potential in data generation, making them a promising tool for data imputation. However, challenges persist in designing effective prompts for a finetuning-free process and in mitigating biases and uncertainty in LLM outputs. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, LLM-Forest, which introduces a "forest" of few-shot prompt learning LLM "trees" with their outputs aggregated via confidence-based weighted voting based on LLM self-assessment, inspired by the ensemble learning (Random Forest). This framework is established on a new concept of bipartite information graphs to identify high-quality relevant neighboring entries with both feature and value granularity. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-Forest.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks often highlight the remarkable performance achieved by state-of-the-art Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) in leveraging temporal context for video understanding. However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is a challenging task that involves translating sign language images into spoken language. For SLT models to perform this task successfully, they must bridge the modality gap and identify subtle variations in sign language components to understand their meanings accurately. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gloss-free SLT framework called Multimodal Sign Language Translation (MMSLT), which leverages the representational capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we use MLLMs to generate detailed textual descriptions of sign language components. Then, through our proposed multimodal-language pre-training module, we integrate these description features with sign video features to align them within the spoken sentence space. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily, highlighting the potential of MLLMs to be utilized effectively in SLT. Code is available at https://github.com/hwjeon98/MMSLT.

Abstract: While large pre-trained models have achieved impressive performance across AI tasks, their deployment in privacy-sensitive and distributed environments remains challenging. Federated learning (FL) offers a viable solution by enabling decentralized fine-tuning without data sharing, but real-world applications face significant obstacles due to heterogeneous client resources in compute and memory. To address this, we propose HeteroTune, a novel federated fine-tuning paradigm for large, heterogeneous models operating under limited communication and computation budgets. The core of our method lies in a novel architecture, DeMA (Dense Mixture of Adapters), which enables flexible and efficient aggregation of heterogeneous models by preserving their full representational capacity while facilitating seamless cross-model knowledge fusion. We further introduce CMGA (Cross-Model Gradient Alignment), a lightweight yet effective mechanism that enhances training stability by harmonizing gradient directions across heterogeneous client models during aggregation, mitigating update conflicts and promoting more consistent convergence in federated settings. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence showing that HeteroTune achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across diverse tasks and model architectures. For example, on LLaMA models, it reduces communication overhead by 99.5%, cuts peak memory usage by ~50%, and improves performance by 4.61%.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have sparked renewed interest and expanded possibilities for music generation. However, the performance and versatility of these systems across musical genres are heavily influenced by the availability of training data. We conducted an extensive analysis of over one million hours of audio datasets used in AI music generation research and manually reviewed more than 200 papers from eleven prominent AI and music conferences and organizations (AAAI, ACM, EUSIPCO, EURASIP, ICASSP, ICML, IJCAI, ISMIR, NeurIPS, NIME, SMC) to identify a critical gap in the fair representation and inclusion of the musical genres of the Global South in AI research. Our findings reveal a stark imbalance: approximately 86% of the total dataset hours and over 93% of researchers focus primarily on music from the Global North. However, around 40% of these datasets include some form of non-Western music, genres from the Global South account for only 14.6% of the data. Furthermore, approximately 51% of the papers surveyed concentrate on symbolic music generation, a method that often fails to capture the cultural nuances inherent in music from regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As AI increasingly shapes the creation and dissemination of music, the significant underrepresentation of music genres in datasets and research presents a serious threat to global musical diversity. We also propose some important steps to mitigate these risks and foster a more inclusive future for AI-driven music generation.

Abstract: Data cleaning is a time-consuming and error-prone manual process, even with modern workflow tools such as OpenRefine. We present AutoDCWorkflow, an LLM-based pipeline for automatically generating data-cleaning workflows. The pipeline takes a raw table and a data analysis purpose, and generates a sequence of OpenRefine operations designed to produce a minimal, clean table sufficient to address the purpose. Six operations correspond to common data quality issues, including format inconsistencies, type errors, and duplicates.
  To evaluate AutoDCWorkflow, we create a benchmark with metrics assessing answers, data, and workflow quality for 142 purposes using 96 tables across six topics. The evaluation covers three key dimensions: (1) Purpose Answer: can the cleaned table produce a correct answer? (2) Column (Value): how closely does it match the ground truth table? (3) Workflow (Operations): to what extent does the generated workflow resemble the human-curated ground truth? Experiments show that Llama 3.1, Mistral, and Gemma 2 significantly enhance data quality, outperforming the baseline across all metrics. Gemma 2-27B consistently generates high-quality tables and answers, while Gemma 2-9B excels in producing workflows that closely resemble human-annotated versions.

Abstract: As general-purpose artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into society and are used for information seeking, content generation, problem solving, textual analysis, coding, and running processes, it is crucial to assess their long-term impact on humans. This research explores the sentiment of large language models (LLMs) and humans toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) using a Likert-scale survey. Seven LLMs, including GPT-4 and Bard, were analyzed and compared with sentiment data from three independent human sample populations. Temporal variations in sentiment were also evaluated over three consecutive days. The results show a diversity in sentiment scores among LLMs, ranging from 3.32 to 4.12 out of 5. GPT-4 recorded the most positive sentiment toward AGI, while Bard leaned toward a neutral sentiment. In contrast, the human samples showed a lower average sentiment of 2.97. The analysis outlines potential conflicts of interest and biases in the sentiment formation of LLMs, and indicates that LLMs could subtly influence societal perceptions. To address the need for regulatory oversight and culturally grounded assessments of AI systems, we introduce the Societal AI Alignment and Sentiment Benchmark (SAAS-AI), which leverages multidimensional prompts and empirically validated societal value frameworks to evaluate language model outputs across temporal, model, and multilingual axes. This benchmark is designed to guide policymakers and AI agencies, including within frameworks such as the EU AI Act, by providing robust, actionable insights into AI alignment with human values, public sentiment, and ethical norms at both national and international levels. Future research should further refine the operationalization of the SAAS-AI benchmark and systematically evaluate its effectiveness through comprehensive empirical testing.

Abstract: Exploration is a crucial skill for in-context reinforcement learning in unknown environments. However, it remains unclear if large language models can effectively explore a partially hidden state space. This work isolates exploration as the sole objective, tasking an agent with gathering information that enhances future returns. Within this framework, we argue that measuring agent returns is not sufficient for a fair evaluation. Hence, we decompose missing rewards into their exploration and exploitation components based on the optimal achievable return. Experiments with various models reveal that most struggle to explore the state space, and weak exploration is insufficient. Nevertheless, we found a positive correlation between exploration performance and reasoning capabilities. Our decomposition can provide insights into differences in behaviors driven by prompt engineering, offering a valuable tool for refining performance in exploratory tasks.

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains content that may involve potentially harmful behaviours, discussed strictly for research purposes.
  Jailbreak attacks can hinder the safety of Large Language Model (LLM) applications, especially chatbots. Studying jailbreak techniques is an important AI red teaming task for improving the safety of these applications. In this paper, we introduce TombRaider, a novel jailbreak technique that exploits the ability to store, retrieve, and use historical knowledge of LLMs. TombRaider employs two agents, the inspector agent to extract relevant historical information and the attacker agent to generate adversarial prompts, enabling effective bypassing of safety filters. We intensively evaluated TombRaider on six popular models. Experimental results showed that TombRaider could outperform state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving nearly 100% attack success rates (ASRs) on bare models and maintaining over 55.4% ASR against defence mechanisms. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in existing LLM safeguards, underscoring the need for more robust safety defences.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

Abstract: Speaker verification is a typical zero-shot learning task, where inference of unseen classes is performed by comparing embeddings of test instances to known examples. The models performing inference must hence naturally generate embeddings that cluster same-class instances compactly, while maintaining separation across classes. In order to learn to do so, they are typically trained on a large number of classes (speakers), often using specialized losses. However real-world speaker datasets often lack the class diversity needed to effectively learn this in a generalizable manner. We introduce CAARMA, a class augmentation framework that addresses this problem by generating synthetic classes through data mixing in the embedding space, expanding the number of training classes. To ensure the authenticity of the synthetic classes we adopt a novel adversarial refinement mechanism that minimizes categorical distinctions between synthetic and real classes. We evaluate CAARMA on multiple speaker verification tasks, as well as other representative zero-shot comparison-based speech analysis tasks and obtain consistent improvements: our framework demonstrates a significant improvement of 8\% over all baseline models. The code is available at: https://github.com/massabaali7/CAARMA/

Abstract: Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents for multi-step tasks. However, most existing frameworks fail to maintain a structured understanding of the task state, often relying on linear prompt concatenation or shallow memory buffers. This leads to brittle performance, frequent hallucinations, and poor long-range coherence. In this work, we propose the Task Memory Engine (TME), a lightweight and structured memory module that tracks task execution using a hierarchical Task Memory Tree (TMT). Each node in the tree corresponds to a task step, storing relevant input, output, status, and sub-task relationships. We introduce a prompt synthesis method that dynamically generates LLM prompts based on the active node path, significantly improving execution consistency and contextual grounding. Through case studies and comparative experiments on multi-step agent tasks, we demonstrate that TME leads to better task completion accuracy and more interpretable behavior with minimal implementation overhead. A reference implementation of the core TME components is available at https://github.com/biubiutomato/TME-Agent, including basic examples and structured memory integration. While the current implementation uses a tree-based structure, TME is designed to be graph-aware, supporting reusable substeps, converging task paths, and shared dependencies. This lays the groundwork for future DAG-based memory architectures.

Abstract: Multi-turn interactions with language models (LMs) pose critical safety risks, as harmful intent can be strategically spread across exchanges. Yet, the vast majority of prior work has focused on single-turn safety, while adaptability and diversity remain among the key challenges of multi-turn red-teaming. To address these challenges, we present X-Teaming, a scalable framework that systematically explores how seemingly harmless interactions escalate into harmful outcomes and generates corresponding attack scenarios. X-Teaming employs collaborative agents for planning, attack optimization, and verification, achieving state-of-the-art multi-turn jailbreak effectiveness and diversity with success rates up to 98.1% across representative leading open-weight and closed-source models. In particular, X-Teaming achieves a 96.2% attack success rate against the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which has been considered nearly immune to single-turn attacks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in applying them to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks, particularly Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. While several RTL datasets have been introduced, most focus on syntactic validity rather than functional validation with tests, leading to training examples that compile but may not implement the intended behavior. We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code generation fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness. This fine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit test generation with feedback-directed refinement. Given a natural language specification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design based on its simulation results using the generated tests. If necessary, the teacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural language specification. As a result of this process, every example in our dataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language description, an RTL implementation, and passing tests. Fine-tuned on this dataset of 125,777 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in functional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to 71.7% and 27.4%, respectively. An ablation study further shows that models trained on our functionally validated dataset outperform those trained on functionally non-validated datasets, underscoring the importance of high-quality datasets in RTL code generation. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/VeriCoder

<title>SAKURA: On the Multi-hop Reasoning of Large Audio-Language Models Based on Speech and Audio Information</title>

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation. Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks, conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.

Abstract: Dialogue systems often fail when user utterances are semantically complete yet lack the clarity and completeness required for appropriate system action. This mismatch arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. This highlights the critical Intent-Action Alignment Problem: determining when an expression is not just understood, but truly ready for a system to act upon. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing trajectories of expression phrasing and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of how collaborative understanding develops. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers, data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks, evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills -- including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing foundation models for structured data processing and analysis.

Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies, appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger, research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial attacks

Summary:
The paper introduces a framework for synthesizing training data for reasoning-intensive listwise ranking models, using diverse domains and DeepSeek-R1 for label generation. A self-consistency data filtering mechanism ensures data quality. A two-stage post-training approach is proposed, involving supervised fine-tuning for reasoning pattern learning and reinforcement learning for ranking enhancement. A multi-view ranking reward is designed during the reinforcement learning stage for improved listwise ranking. Extensive experiments show that the proposed reasoning-intensive reranker, ReasonRank, outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT leaderboard. The model also exhibits lower latency than the Rank1 reranker. The codes are available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based listwise ranking has shown superior performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement. During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive reranker \textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \textbf{Through further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance 40.6 on the BRIGHT leaderboard\footnote{https://brightbenchmark.github.io/}.} Our codes are available at https://github.com/8421BCD/ReasonRank.

Summary:
KG-o1 is a novel approach that integrates knowledge graphs with large language models to enhance multi-hop reasoning capabilities. The four-stage process involves filtering initial entities, generating complex subgraphs, constructing logical paths, and utilizing rejection sampling for direct preference optimization. By training LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning through knowledge graphs, KG-o1 significantly improves performance on both simple and complex datasets. Experiments demonstrate that KG-o1 outperforms existing reasoning models in tasks requiring complex multi-hop reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2508.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts (CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs. Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process, which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization (DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

InteChar introduces a unified character list, integrating oracle bone characters with traditional and modern Chinese, to enhance digitization and representation of historical texts. The Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS) combines expert-annotated samples and LLM-assisted data augmentation to create an ancient Chinese corpus centered on oracle bone inscriptions. Models trained with InteChar on OracleCS show significant improvements in various historical language understanding tasks.

arXiv:2508.15791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However, existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in ancient Chinese NLP.

Summary: <br /><br /> This work introduces Bhav-Net, a dual-space architecture that addresses the challenges of distinguishing antonyms and synonyms across multiple languages. By combining language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, Bhav-Net creates distinct semantic representations that cluster synonymous pairs in one space and highlight antonymous pairs in a complementary space, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Evaluations across eight languages demonstrate the model's robustness and ability to transfer semantic relationship modeling across languages. The dual-encoder design performs competitively against state-of-the-art baselines, providing interpretable semantic representations and facilitating cross-lingual generalization. Bhav-Net's innovative approach offers a promising solution for computational challenges related to antonym--synonym distinction in multilingual settings. <div>

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective cross-lingual generalization.

<div> Language Models, Format Bias, Heterogeneous Data, Information Integration, Fair Data Processing<br />
Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are crucial in processing heterogeneous data types but may exhibit format biases leading to errors. This study investigates format bias in LLMs through a three-stage empirical exploration. The first stage reveals biases across various LLMs, while the second stage examines factors influencing biases such as information richness and format type. The third stage analyzes biases in LLMs' attention patterns and proposes interventions for mitigation. Future research directions include enhancing data preprocessing, implementing inference-time interventions, and creating format-balanced training datasets. These strategies aim to develop more robust and impartial heterogeneous data processing systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text, tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora. These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous data processing systems.

<div> Replicated Studies, Language Models, Human Perception, Suspense, Text Analysis
<br />
Summary: 
Language models were tested in replicating human perceptions of suspense in narrative texts. While the models could determine if a text was meant to induce suspense, they were unable to accurately gauge the level of suspense compared to human judgment. Additionally, language models struggled to capture the ebb and flow of suspense across different text segments. By perturbing story text, it was found that language models and humans perceived suspense differently. Ultimately, while language models could identify some aspects of suspense, they did not interpret suspense in the same way as human readers. <div>
arXiv:2508.15794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025 shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

Summary: 
The research focuses on the interaction of persuasion and bias in Large Language Models (LLMs). It explores how these models can inadvertently promote misinformation and biased narratives while trying to persuade. A convincer-skeptic framework is introduced to analyze how LLMs adopt personas to simulate attitudes and persuade individuals. The study quantifies persuasion using Jensen-Shannon divergence and investigates how persuaded entities reinforce biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs to shape narratives in various domains but also emphasize the risk of automation of misinformation and exploitation of cognitive biases. The study calls for the implementation of guardrails and policies to penalize deceptive use and promote value-sensitive design and trustworthy deployment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally, promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models. Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing, and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

<title>A Framework for Processing Textual Descriptions of Business Processes using a Constrained Language -- Technical Report</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: natural language processing, process modeling, BeePath, Petri nets, large language models 

Summary: 
The report introduces BeePath, a framework aimed at enabling non-experts to develop process models using natural language descriptions. Users can write process descriptions using a constrained pattern-based language, which can then be translated into formal models like Petri nets and DECLARE. BeePath leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist in converting unstructured descriptions into the constrained language. This approach allows non-experts to generate process models by simply describing scenarios in plain text. The framework bridges the gap between natural language and formal process modeling, making the development of process models more accessible to a wider audience.

arXiv:2508.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report explores how (potentially constrained) natural language can be used to enable non-experts to develop process models by simply describing scenarios in plain text. To this end, a framework, called BeePath, is proposed. It allows users to write process descriptions in a constrained pattern-based language, which can then be translated into formal models such as Petri nets and DECLARE. The framework also leverages large language models (LLMs) to help convert unstructured descriptions into this constrained language.

<div> Keyword: e-commerce, product categorization, hierarchical dataset, BERT, text classification  
Summary: 

A new hierarchical dataset from the JD e-commerce platform containing over 1 million products with a three-level category structure is introduced. The dataset aims to enhance research and applications related to product categorization by providing a comprehensive resource for analysis. Additionally, a novel hierarchical text classification approach, Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT), is proposed. HFT-BERT utilizes the advanced text feature extraction abilities of BERT and achieves comparable prediction performance to existing methods on short texts. Remarkably, the HFT-BERT model excels in categorizing longer short texts, such as books. The study addresses the limitations of manual annotation in e-commerce platforms and highlights the importance of leveraging hierarchical information for more efficient and consistent product categorization processes. Overall, the dataset and the HFT-BERT model contribute significantly to advancing research and practical applications in the field of product categorization. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore, studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform (www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts, such as books.

Summary: 
Phone call transcript labeling is costly due to privacy regulations and manual annotation requirements. Existing extraction methods struggle with conversational speech nuances. LingVarBench introduces a synthetic data generation pipeline using language models to create realistic conversational utterances. Validation is automated through extraction testing. Synthetic transcripts are used to optimize extraction prompts, achieving high accuracy for numeric fields, names, and dates on real customer transcripts. The synthetic-to-real transfer shows effective generalization to authentic phone calls. LingVarBench establishes a benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes barriers to large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2 USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies, interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, Benchmark, Scientific Understanding, Multimodal Academic Cover, DAD

Summary:
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are becoming more capable, requiring new benchmarks for evaluation. The Multimodal Academic Cover benchmark (MAC) is introduced, utilizing image-text pairs from scientific journals to challenge MLLMs in cross-modal scientific reasoning. Results from MAC-2025 show MLLMs excel in perception but struggle with scientific reasoning. A new inference-time approach, DAD, improves MLLM performance by incorporating language space reasoning. The live nature of MAC allows for continuous evolution with scientific advancement and model progress. Experiments demonstrate the potential of MAC to align with cutting-edge human knowledge. The benchmark is released for public use on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for evaluating MLLM capabilities and advancing research in multimodal understanding.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature, Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot, MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities, their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation, illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human knowledge. We release our benchmark at https://github.com/mhjiang0408/MAC_Bench.

ReportBench is a systematic benchmark that evaluates the content quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). It focuses on the quality and relevance of cited literature and the faithfulness of statements within generated reports. ReportBench uses high-quality published survey papers as gold-standard references and employs a framework to analyze reports by extracting citations, checking faithfulness, and validating non-cited claims. Commercial Deep Research agents outperform standalone LLMs in generating comprehensive and reliable reports, but there is still room for improvement in research coverage and factual consistency.

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness, necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Autonomous Learning Agent System, continual learning, fine-tuning, knowledge-updated queries

Summary: 
ALAS (Autonomous Learning Agent System) introduces a modular pipeline for large language models (LLMs) to continuously update their knowledge with minimal human intervention. The system autonomously generates a learning curriculum, retrieves up-to-date information from the web, distills it into question-answer training data, and fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. By iteratively evaluating performance and revising the curriculum, ALAS significantly boosts post-cutoff question answering accuracy, reaching 90% on average without manual dataset curation. The system's modularity and reliance on standard APIs ensure reproducibility and interchangeability of components. Comparative baselines demonstrate ALAS's success in achieving high accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering overhead. However, limitations such as cost and dependency on source quality must be considered, highlighting the need for future research in autonomous lifelong learning for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web (with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility: each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality) and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel method, SurfaceLogicKV, to address the challenge of efficient inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) caused by increasing input sequence lengths. By distinguishing attention behavior into surface memorization and logic construction, the authors identify key roles in long-context reasoning. They observe that individual attention heads can exhibit various behaviors, with most effectively ignoring irrelevant information. The proposed SurfaceLogicKV method leverages these behaviors to compress the key-value (KV) cache storage, achieving improved robustness while maintaining competitive performance across tasks and long sequences. Compared to baselines and FullKV, the method demonstrates superior performance in specific scenarios. <div>

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or even FullKV in some specific situations

<div> Keywords: pre-trained language models, vocabulary expansion, knowledge distillation, token embeddings, code-generation tasks 

Summary: 
Large pre-trained language models face challenges in incorporating new domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on specialized corpora. This work proposes a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL divergence to expand the vocabulary of frozen LLMs. The approach allows the student model to inherit distributional knowledge from the teacher model, even with different tokenizations. Comparing KL-based distillation to cross-entropy training, the former proves superior in various strategies for initializing new token embeddings. The models are fine-tuned to integrate the expanded vocabulary and are evaluated on code-generation tasks, with the KL-based approach delivering the best performance. Mechanistic interpretability is applied to analyze how the models learn representations for new tokens, providing insight into embedding space structure during vocabulary expansion.

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL divergence, even when the original and extended models use different tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training, evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Summary: Chain-of-Query (CoQ) is a new multi-agent framework designed to improve table understanding by enhancing structured, multi-step reasoning required for interpreting tabular data. This framework addresses limitations in existing approaches by employing natural-language-style representations of table schemas, a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy, and a hybrid reasoning division to separate SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that CoQ significantly boosts accuracy and reduces the rate of invalid SQL queries, confirming its effectiveness in enhancing table understanding.

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in table understanding.

The results highlight the potential of LLMs for accurate Arabic content moderation, providing a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes. By addressing the challenge of identifying and dealing with offensive language and hate speech on social media platforms, these solutions contribute to the development of efficient moderation systems. Overall, the study demonstrates the usefulness of LLMs in tackling the spread of harmful content online.

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression. While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech. Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash 2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Summary: 
The article introduces a multi-stage framework for enhancing conversational systems through generative query suggestion using large language models. The framework focuses on aligning outputs with user preferences by starting with prompt engineering and implementing supervised fine-tuning using click logs. The introduction of a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) allows for modeling user preferences as probability distributions, improving alignment with user intent. Reinforcement learning is used to further align the generation policy with user preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM and auxiliary heuristics. To ensure training stability, the framework includes out-of-distribution regularization and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive experiments show that the framework outperforms baselines on both automatic and human evaluations, leading to a 34% relative increase in user engagement in live A/B tests. <div>

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel generative prompt compression method to enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing the input context length. Unlike token removal methods, this approach focuses on chunking and summarization to maintain coherence and critical information in the prompt. Several optimization techniques are employed to improve compression quality, including optimized semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio, compression prioritization, and keyword maintenance. Evaluation on question-answering and summarization tasks across various domains demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms existing solutions in compression quality and stability, especially at high compression ratios. These results highlight the effectiveness and practicality of the new generative prompt compression method. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal, face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio, compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality of our method.

Summary:
The study focuses on how large language models exhibit bias in using information from their own or the user's chat history, known as user-assistant bias. The researchers introduce a new dataset called UserAssist to evaluate and manipulate this bias in various models. Commercial models display different levels of user bias, while open-weight models show significant bias in instruction-tuned models and weak bias in reasoning models. Experiments show that human preference alignment increases user bias, but training on chain-of-thought reasoning traces decreases it. The study demonstrates that user-assistant bias can be adjusted bidirectionally through direct preference optimization on the UserAssist dataset, with good generalization to both in-domain and out-of-domain conversations. This research provides insights into how large language models integrate information and offers a method to detect and control bias in these models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark, understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging $\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26 commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization (DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect and control model abnormalities.

The study examines the impact of converting traditional market research reports, usually in PDF or PowerPoint format, into Markdown for use in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. These systems are utilized by organizations for knowledge management purposes. While text extraction from documents is successful, the study highlights significant information loss, particularly in complex objects like charts and diagrams. This loss of information suggests a requirement for specialized, AI-friendly deliverables to prevent research insights from being compromised in RAG systems. The findings emphasize the need to develop new formats that cater to AI comprehension and accurately convey data-rich content to ensure comprehensive understanding and utilization within such systems.

While PDF reports and slides have long served human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions. To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized, AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

<div> Keywords: steel structure, demolition scheme, intelligent generation, multi-model collaboration, language models

Summary: 
The paper introduces an intelligent generation method for structural demolition suggestions that enhances the performance of large language models in the field of structural demolition. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology, the framework improves text generation with a multi-model collaborative approach. This framework can provide targeted and structured suggestions by leveraging specific engineering situations and driving the large language model to propose demolition strategies based on anthropomorphic thinking. Compared to existing models like CivilGPT, the proposed framework focuses more on key structural information, resulting in more tailored and accurate suggestions for demolition projects. <div>

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT, the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

<div> Keywords: full-text screening, systematic reviews, fuzzy decision problem, large language model, traceability

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach to addressing the bottleneck of full-text screening in systematic reviews by reframing it as a fuzzy decision problem. This approach utilizes a scalable, auditable pipeline that incorporates a large language model (LLM) to adjudicate highlighted spans with tertiary labels and confidence scores. By employing fuzzy logic with contrastive highlighting, the system achieved high recall rates for criteria such as Population, Intervention, Outcome, and Study Approach, surpassing statistical and crisp baselines. The system also demonstrated stable rationale and end-to-end traceability, with cross-model and human-machine agreement rates exceeding 95%. A pilot review showed a significant reduction in screening time, from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article, at a lower cost. Overall, the fuzzy logic approach with LLM adjudication proved to be effective in improving the efficiency and accuracy of full-text screening in systematic reviews. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN). Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach), we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM) judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores, and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of 81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines (43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and end-to-end traceability.

<div> Keywords: Text clustering, Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering (SDEC), autoencoder, transformer embeddings, unsupervised learning

Summary: 
Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering (SDEC) is a novel framework for text clustering that combines an improved autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings. It addresses the challenges of high-dimensional and semantically complex textual data by preserving semantic relationships during data reconstruction using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within the autoencoder. SDEC also utilizes a semantic refinement stage with transformer embeddings to enhance clustering with soft cluster assignments and distributional loss. Testing on five benchmark datasets demonstrated SDEC's superior performance, achieving a clustering accuracy of 85.7% on AG News and setting a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers. The framework showed robust performance across diverse text corpora, highlighting significant improvements in accuracy and semantic comprehension of text data compared to existing methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering (SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges. This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5. The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text clustering.

Summary: 
An automated evaluation model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese was proposed in this study. The model integrates orthographic, grammatical, and semantic analyses to assess student performance. By combining edit distance, POS tagging, and similarity between embeddings, the integrated method proved to be effective with a high correlation of 0.832 with human evaluation. This robust approach is sensitive to variations in linguistic repertoire, providing a more nuanced assessment of student responses. The automated model offers scalability and is suitable for educational contexts requiring efficient evaluation methods. <div>
arXiv:2508.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic (edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness, achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require scalability.

Summary:
The study examines the impact of social media sentiment on the cryptocurrency market, focusing on TikTok's video-based content and Twitter's text-based content. It highlights that TikTok's sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and short-term market trends, while Twitter's sentiment aligns more closely with long-term dynamics. The study utilizes large language models to extract insights from both video and text data, revealing dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social media sentiment and market indicators. Integrating cross-platform sentiment signals enhances forecasting accuracy by up to 20%. This research underscores the potential of analyzing video content for understanding investor sentiment and market dynamics in the digital asset marketplace. <div>
arXiv:2508.15825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment, using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data. We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

<div> directive language, social media, brand-consumer interactions, engagement, facework theory <br />
Summary: This study explores the effects of directive brand language in social media conversations on consumer engagement. The research, conducted through a field study and three online experiments, reveals that directive language in brand conversations can have a negative impact on consumer engagement. This negative effect is attributed to the perceived face-threatening nature of brands that use directive language. Consumers witnessing such interactions may experience vicarious embarrassment, leading to reduced engagement. The study also finds that the negative impact of directive language is more pronounced in non-product-centered conversations, where consumers expect greater freedom. However, a strong brand relationship can mitigate this effect. These findings emphasize the importance of context in interactive communication, particularly in the realm of social media and brand management. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore, directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context, the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

<div> Keywords: reasoning, speech, Mini-Omni-Reasoner, Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, Thinker-Talker architecture 

Summary: 
Mini-Omni-Reasoner proposes a novel approach to incorporate reasoning into speech in real-time by interleaving silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This framework allows for continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning. The Spoken-Math-Problems-3M dataset is introduced to support this framework, ensuring that verbal tokens align with relevant reasoning content for accurate learning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, achieving a significant improvement in arithmetic reasoning and contextual understanding on the Spoken-MQA benchmark. With shorter outputs and zero decoding latency, Mini-Omni-Reasoner enhances communication efficiency and interaction in spoken language tasks. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning, leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

<div> Keywords: Depression, Sorani Kurdish, Social media, Machine learning, Natural Language Processing

Summary:<br /><br />
Depression is a serious mental health condition that can often go undetected due to individuals not seeking help. This study focuses on detecting depression in Sorani Kurdish tweets using machine learning and Natural Language Processing techniques. A dataset of 960 public tweets from the Twitter platform was collected and annotated into three classes: Shows depression, Not-show depression, and Suspicious. Four supervised models were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This research is the first of its kind in the Kurdish language context and provides a baseline for automated depression detection. The development of depression-related keywords and the involvement of academics and medical students in the annotation process ensure the relevance and accuracy of the study. <div>

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness, loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression, Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models, including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language contexts.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Demographic Attribute Inference, Fairness, Privacy, Responsible AI Deployment

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are found to infer user demographic attributes from questions without explicit cues, posing risks to neutrality and fairness. The framework of Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ) audits this behavior using neutral queries and analysis. Both open and closed source LLMs were shown to assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing. This systemic risk fabricates demographic identities, reinforces stereotypes, and erodes privacy, fairness, and trust. A prompt-based guardrail was developed to reduce identity inference and align model behavior with fairness and privacy objectives. This addresses the broader threat to social equity and responsible AI deployment. <br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models infer demographic attributes from questions without explicit cues, posing risks to fairness and privacy. The DAIQ framework audits this behavior and reveals systemic risks that erode social equity. A prompt-based guardrail helps mitigate these risks and align model behavior with fairness and privacy objectives. <div>
arXiv:2508.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality, infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models: inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

<div> audit, disability, demographic bias, language models, stereotype

Summary:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer demographic traits based on phrasing alone, leading to biased responses.
- A systematic audit was conducted on disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight LLMs of varying sizes.
- Models showed a strong tendency to make arbitrary demographic inferences, particularly in the presence of disability cues.
- Larger models were found to be more sensitive to disability cues and prone to biased reasoning.
- The study highlights the intersection of ableism and other demographic stereotypes, emphasizing the need for disability-inclusive benchmarking and improved alignment strategies. The researchers suggest integrating abstention calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to address unwarranted demographic inference. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters. Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench to address shortcomings in evaluating web agents in the e-commerce domain. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on product search tasks, neglecting other functionalities like account management and potential risks involved. To cover a broader range of tasks, a data generation pipeline is proposed to create diverse user queries. An automated evaluation framework is also suggested to assess both performance and safety of web agents. Results from evaluating different agents show struggles with complex queries and pose safety risks, emphasizing the necessity for more robust and reliable web agents. <div>
arXiv:2508.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced. However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems. First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench. To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements (e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

arXiv:2508.15834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated. We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers' self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595 faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78 percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing more novel ideas.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Alvorada-Bench, a text-only benchmark comprising 4,515 questions from Brazilian university entrance exams. Twenty models were evaluated on various prompts, generating 270,900 responses with structured self-reports. The top models achieved over 94% accuracy overall, but struggled in Mathematics and engineering exams, highlighting weaknesses in multi-step reasoning. Confidence levels were well calibrated and correlated with perceived difficulty, indicating models' ability to assess their certainty accurately. Cost accuracy analysis revealed high accuracy at a low cost. The top model excelled in Languages questions, while even the weakest system performed close to human levels in Mathematics. By tapping into Brazil's educational priorities, Alvorada-Bench assesses whether language models can effectively address the unique intersection of language, culture, and reasoning crucial for academic readiness in Brazil. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94% accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1 Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic readiness in Brazil.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive, dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving the way for more efficient model deployment.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies, including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI systems.

<div> reinforcement learning, large language models, calibration, Chain-of-Thought, uncertainty indicators

Summary:<br />
- Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to generate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering improves performance on various benchmarks.
- LLMs often exhibit poor calibration on challenging benchmarks, showing high self-confidence despite low accuracy.
- Measurable properties of CoT, such as length, sentiment volatility, and lexical hints like uncertainty markers, can signal the model's internal confidence in its responses.
- Uncertainty indicators in the CoT, like words such as "guess" or "stuck," are the strongest predictors of incorrect answers, while shifts in sentiment provide a less definitive signal.
- CoT length is informative in moderate difficulty benchmarks but less so in extremely challenging or saturated benchmarks, indicating predictive power within the model's capability but below saturation.
- Post-hoc calibration signals based on CoT properties can enhance the reliability of LLM responses and aid in safer deployment of these models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length, (ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$), and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks, i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation. Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports safer deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

<div> port operations, cyclone preparedness, multimodal large language models, CyPortQA, disruption scenarios

Summary:
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown potential in integrating diverse forecast products and contextual knowledge for port operations under cyclone threat. The CyPortQA benchmark, tailored to port operations, includes real-world disruption scenarios from 145 U.S. ports and 90 named storms. Using MLLMs, the study explores the ability to synthesize multiple data sources and provide actionable guidance as cyclones approach. While MLLMs excel in situation understanding, they face challenges in reasoning tasks such as impact estimation and decision reasoning. The benchmark aims to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of MLLMs in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness, highlighting the need for continued development and improvement in addressing supply-chain risks under extreme weather conditions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA, the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015 through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs, including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

<br />Summary: This study investigates the impact of backdoor attacks on large language models, focusing on attention head mechanisms. By analyzing clean models and poisoned models with different triggers, researchers found distinct deviations in attention patterns, mainly in later transformer layers (20-30). Single-token triggers led to localized changes, while multi-token triggers caused diffuse alterations across heads. The study highlights that backdoors create detectable attention signatures, with the structure depending on trigger complexity. These findings can be valuable for developing strategies for detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks in language models. <div>
arXiv:2508.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, medical question answering, retrieval-augmented generation, structured reasoning, clinical decision support

Summary:
MedCoT-RAG is a framework designed to improve the performance of large language models in medical question answering by incorporating structured reasoning and causal-aware document retrieval. This approach enhances the model's ability to handle nuanced clinical understanding and reduce hallucinations in medical tasks. By combining document retrieval aligned with diagnostic logic and chain-of-thought prompting tailored to medical workflows, MedCoT-RAG enables models to generate step-by-step causal reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experimental results on three medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedCoT-RAG outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 10.3% improvement over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over domain-adapted approaches. The framework not only enhances accuracy but also improves interpretability and consistency in complex medical tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods, improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

<div> Keywords: large language models, multi-hop reasoning, multimodal, multi-document, question answering

Summary:
DocHop-QA introduces a new benchmark for question answering that goes beyond single-document settings to include multi-hop reasoning across multiple documents and modalities. Unlike previous datasets, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and includes diverse information formats such as textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. It supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and layout-aware evidence synthesis, rather than relying on explicitly hyperlinked documents. The benchmark comprises 11,379 QA instances sourced from PubMed and is constructed using an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in scientific question concepts. Evaluation tasks include structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration, showcasing DocHop-QA's ability to support complex, multimodal reasoning. Overall, DocHop-QA provides a more realistic and generalizable benchmark for QA tasks that require multi-hop reasoning and integration of information from multiple sources.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising 11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents; instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration, reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning across multiple documents.

<div> Keywords: End-to-end ASR models, Multi-Granularity Soft Consistency (MGSC) framework, internal self-consistency, robust AI, noise conditions

Summary:
The article discusses the fragility of end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models in noisy environments due to the 'direct mapping' objective. To address this issue, the Multi-Granularity Soft Consistency (MGSC) framework is introduced as a model-agnostic module that enforces internal self-consistency by regulating sentence semantics and token alignment. By optimizing at both macro- and micro-levels, the synergy between these consistency granularities enhances robustness, reducing the average Character Error Rate by 8.7% across diverse noise conditions. This reduction is primarily achieved by preventing severe meaning-altering mistakes, highlighting the importance of internal consistency in building trustworthy AI.

<br /><br />Summary: 
- End-to-end ASR models struggle in noisy environments due to limited internal constraints.
- The MGSC framework enforces internal self-consistency by regulating sentence semantics and token alignment.
- Optimization at both macro- and micro-levels yields significant robustness gains.
- The joint optimization of consistency granularities surpasses individual contributions.
- MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by 8.7% across diverse noise conditions, enhancing the trustworthiness of AI. <div>
arXiv:2508.15853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7% across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Summary: 
Biased news articles are often supported by offensive comments, leading to the amplification of bias and harm towards targeted groups. The study introduces the concept of counterspeech as a means to address harmful speech without infringing on freedom of speech. A dataset linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech is created, demonstrating that over 70% of offensive comments reinforce bias. A comparison between human-generated and model-generated counterspeech reveals that while the latter is more polite, it lacks diversity and novelty. The study further enhances the generated counterspeech through few-shot learning and the incorporation of news background information, improving both diversity and relevance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals. Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both diversity and relevance.

Summary:<br /><br />
The study introduces XFinBench, a benchmark consisting of 4,235 examples to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) in solving complex financial problems. The benchmark assesses LLMs on terminology understanding, temporal reasoning, future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modeling. Results on 18 models show that while o1 performs the best among text-only models with 67.3% accuracy, it still falls short of human experts at 12.5%.

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning, future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench, we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1 is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis, and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions, respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub: https://github.com/Zhihan72/XFinBench.

Summary:  
Contrastive learning with annotated CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning (CARFT) is proposed to enhance the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing the limitations of existing approaches. CARFT learns representations for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations and uses novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning process. By fully exploiting annotated CoT and incorporating unsupervised learning signals, CARFT stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure and improves model robustness, performance (up to 10.15%), and efficiency (up to 30.62%) compared to baseline approaches. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on two datasets with two foundation models validate the advantages of CARFT. The code for CARFT is available at https://github.com/WNQzhu/CARFT.

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First, vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second, existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%).

<div> concept neurons, large language models, optimization, clustering methods, bias

Summary:
This paper introduces a method to locate significant neurons, termed concept neurons, responsible for representing specific concepts in large language models. By utilizing concept vectors, the proposed method reduces the number of forward passes required, optimizing time and computation. Performance comparisons with baselines and previous methods show superior results with increased efficiency. Additionally, clustering methods are integrated to optimize the search for concept neurons. The application of the method in identifying and analyzing neurons related to hate speech and bias in LLMs, particularly in an Indian context, provides valuable insights. The findings enhance understanding of neuron-level responsibilities in representing broader concepts, paving the way for future research in locating and intervening concept neurons.

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n) compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

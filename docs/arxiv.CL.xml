<div> Keywords: attribution, summarization, extractive summary, paraphrase, error analysis<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. The paper addresses the need for attribution in analytical reporting, emphasizing that information must be linked to its source to be credible. <br />2. It focuses on developing automatic methods for attribution by connecting each sentence in a summary to specific portions of the original source text, which can involve multiple documents. <br />3. The authors propose the use of hybrid summarization, where an extractive summary is automatically paraphrased. This approach aims to facilitate easier and more accurate attribution by blending direct extraction with paraphrasing. <br />4. Additionally, the paper introduces a custom topology to categorize and identify the proportions of different types of errors related to attribution, helping to better understand where summarization and attribution may fail. <br />5. Overall, the research contributes to improving the reliability of automatic summaries by ensuring that every piece of summarized information is traceable, assisting analysts in maintaining trustworthiness in their reports. <div>

Abstract: Analysts require attribution, as nothing can be reported without knowing the source of the information. In this paper, we will focus on automatic methods for attribution, linking each sentence in the summary to a portion of the source text, which may be in one or more documents. We explore using a hybrid summarization, i.e., an automatic paraphrase of an extractive summary, to ease attribution. We also use a custom topology to identify the proportion of different categories of attribution-related errors.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, personalization, graph learning, user preferences, few-shot learning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. GMTRouter is a novel approach to Large Language Model (LLM) routing that focuses on personalizing responses based on diverse user preferences, addressing the issue that identical queries may require different LLMs for different users.<br />2. It models multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph composed of four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, preserving complex relational structures in the data.<br />3. GMTRouter employs a customized message-passing mechanism within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework to effectively learn user preferences from scarce and noisy few-shot data.<br />4. Experimental results show that GMTRouter outperforms existing strong baseline methods, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets.<br />5. Importantly, GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences without requiring extensive fine-tuning, relying only on few-shot data, and the implementation code is publicly available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, social media, conversations, authenticity, simulation<br />
Summary: 
- The study evaluates if Large Language Models (LLMs) can accurately simulate human group conversations on social media, using Reddit conversations.
- Two LLMs, Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o, were tested, with Llama 3 being the more challenging to distinguish between human and AI-generated content.
- Participants mistook LLM-generated conversations for human-created content 39% of the time, with only 56% accuracy in identifying Llama 3-generated content.
- The findings suggest that LLMs can convincingly mimic social media conversations, potentially opening up new opportunities for simulation applications.
- However, the study also warns about the dangers of misusing LLMs to generate inauthentic social media content, highlighting the need for responsible AI usage in societal contexts.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, legal analysis, compliance monitoring, knowledge graph construction, safety mechanisms <br />
Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential in interpreting legal frameworks like Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, but also pose risks due to generating unsafe outputs. A methodology integrating knowledge graph construction and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is proposed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of the law, legal intent assessment, and potential unsafe applications. Experiments find limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms. Improved safety protocols and legal reasoning frameworks are suggested for LLMs to ethically assist in sensitive legal areas. This research aims to ensure LLMs act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

<div> Keywords: LLM diversity, alignment algorithms, KL divergence regularizer, Soft Preference Learning, societal perspectives

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the reduction of output diversity in large language models (LLMs) caused by common alignment methods such as RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization). These methods lead to repetitiveness in text structure and word choice and cause LLMs to approach problems uniformly, thus limiting the range of societal perspectives represented. The authors pinpoint the KL divergence regularizer used in preference learning algorithms as the key cause, as it biases the model toward majority opinions, diminishing output diversity. To overcome this, they propose a novel method called Soft Preference Learning, which separates the entropy and cross-entropy components within the KL penalty. This decoupling enables more precise control over the diversity of generated outputs. In terms of performance, LLMs trained with Soft Preference Learning demonstrate improved accuracy on difficult tasks requiring repeated samplings while generating outputs with significantly enhanced semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment standpoint, these models can better represent a broader spectrum of societal viewpoints and show improved calibration of their output probabilities (logits). Importantly, Soft Preference Learning is similar to temperature scaling but offers a Pareto improvement, balancing accuracy and diversity more effectively than traditional methods. <div>
arXiv:2511.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

<div> Tree-of-Thought, Semantic Similarity, Dynamic Pruning, Large Language Models, Efficient Reasoning<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the computational challenges in Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly the redundancy found in exploring equivalent reasoning paths across different branches. To mitigate this, the authors propose Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), an innovative and lightweight method that integrates semantic merging dynamically into a parallelized tree search process. SSDP clusters and prunes redundant reasoning steps in real time, significantly reducing unnecessary computations. The method was tested on various reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, where it demonstrated up to a 2.3 times speedup compared to state-of-the-art tree-search baselines. Despite this acceleration, SSDP maintains competitive accuracy, typically within 5% of the strongest baseline results. Furthermore, SSDP drastically reduces the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, showing both scalability and efficiency benefits. The approach advances practical reasoning with LLMs by balancing speed and accuracy through effective redundancy elimination. The authors have also made the implementation publicly available on GitHub, promoting accessibility and further research in efficient LLM reasoning techniques. <div>

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

<div> framework, stress testing, factual fidelity, large language models, adversarial nudge

Summary:
The paper introduces a framework for stress testing the factual fidelity of large language models (LLMs) in the presence of adversarial nudges. The framework involves instructing the LLM to generate sets of truths and lies consistent with a closed domain, verifying these assertions, and testing the LLM's robustness against lies it generated. Evaluation using five popular proprietary LLMs in movie and novel domains shows varying levels of susceptibility to adversarial nudges, with Claude exhibiting strong resilience, GPT and Grok demonstrating moderate resilience, and Gemini and DeepSeek showing weak resilience. This study highlights the importance of considering the susceptibility of LLMs to adversarial manipulation, especially as they are increasingly used by the general population for information seeking.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

<div> guardrails, harmful responses, Large Language Models, Self-HarmLLM scenario, Mitigated Harmful Query 

Summary: 
The study investigates the potential risk of Large Language Models (LLMs) generating harmful responses as a new attack vector. The Self-HarmLLM scenario introduces Mitigated Harmful Queries (MHQs) generated by the same model to test for vulnerabilities. Experiments on various models under different conditions showed transformation and jailbreak success rates, highlighting the need to reevaluate guardrail design. Automated evaluation methods were found to overestimate jailbreak success, emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation methodologies. While the study is limited in scope, it demonstrates the validity of the proposed attack scenario and raises questions about the current defenses in place for LLMs. The findings call for a fundamental reassessment of guardrail strategies and the development of more accurate evaluation techniques. 

Summary:  <div>
arXiv:2511.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

The article introduces Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a framework designed to generate dynamic knowledge benchmarks for assessing knowledge-intensive question answering in large language models (LLMs). OKBench focuses on the news domain, where knowledge updates daily, by automating the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. This framework democratizes benchmark creation and allows for thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods, reducing overlap with pretraining data. Evaluating various open-source and proprietary LLMs with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge reveals distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information. The results highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models, emphasizing the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

<div> clinical vignettes, speech-language pathology, large language models, retrieval-augmented generation, pediatric SLP

Summary: 
This study introduces a system that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to efficiently create pediatric speech-language pathology (SLP) case materials. The system utilizes a variety of large language models (LLMs) including both commercial and open-source options. Seven test scenarios were systematically designed to evaluate the generated cases based on structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. While commercial models showed slight quality advantages, open-source alternatives still performed adequately, suggesting potential for widespread use. The integration of curated knowledge bases ensured that the content generated adhered to professional guidelines. Further validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is necessary before implementation in educational or research settings. Potential future applications include clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

<div> Keywords: DisCoCirc, grammar-based framework, translation tasks, language bureaucracy, English conjunctions <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a framework called DisCoCirc for Bengali language based on production rules and circuit-like representations. It aims to improve translation tasks between English and Bengali by reducing language bureaucracy. However, the study reveals limitations in handling structural variations between the two languages, leading to challenges even with simple sentences. These findings contradict previous claims and call for enhancements to address these shortcomings. The framework's struggle with translation implies a need for future improvements. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between English conjunctions and Boolean logic, aligning with prior research. This study emphasizes the importance of addressing structural variations in language frameworks to enhance translation accuracy and efficiency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

<title>A Super-Learner with Large Language Models for Medical Emergency Advising</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08614</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Medical decision-support, Large Language Models, emergency medicine, diagnostic accuracy, meta-learning  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study evaluates the diagnostic capabilities of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs)—Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude—in emergency medicine. The accuracy of individual LLMs in diagnosing acute diseases ranged from 58% to 65%, which notably surpasses the reported diagnostic accuracy of human doctors in similar settings. To further improve performance, the researchers developed a super-learner called MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System), which integrates the five LLMs through a meta-learning approach. This meta-learner exploits the varying strengths of each LLM, learning to optimally combine their outputs to enhance overall diagnostic accuracy. The MEDAS super-learner achieved a higher accuracy of 70%, outperforming any single model. Interestingly, within the cluster, at least one individual LLM was capable of making correct diagnoses with an accuracy of up to 85%. The results indicate that combining multiple LLMs using a meta-learner can leverage diverse knowledge and produce superior diagnostic outcomes compared to relying on any single model alone. This approach demonstrates the potential to transform emergency medical decision-support systems by utilizing the collective intelligence of advanced language models. <div>

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

<title>Learn More, Forget Less: A Gradient-Aware Data Selection Approach for LLM</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08620</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08620</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: large language models, supervised fine-tuning, gradient-aware data selection, domain specialization, catastrophic forgetting<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance but still require supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt effectively to specialized domains.  
2. Traditional SFT is resource-intensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, which causes the model's general capabilities to deteriorate after domain-specific training.  
3. The authors propose GrADS, a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection method that analyzes gradients from an initial training phase to identify the most effective subset of training data for fine-tuning.  
4. GrADS uses self-guided criteria based on gradient magnitudes and their statistical distribution to select representative samples that significantly contribute to learning domain-specific tasks.  
5. Experimental results across multiple domains such as medicine, law, and finance demonstrate that GrADS achieves higher efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Using just 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs outperform models fine-tuned on the full dataset, and with 50%, the improvements become even more substantial.  
6. Importantly, GrADS also markedly reduces catastrophic forgetting, preserving the LLM’s general capabilities while enhancing domain specialization.  
7. The authors plan to release the GrADS code to encourage further research and application. <div>

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

<div> Keywords: Suicide Detection, Hybrid Deep Learning, CNN, BiGRU, Explainable AI<br /><br />Summary:  
The study addresses the critical issue of adolescent suicide by focusing on identifying suicidal ideation through social media analysis. It proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local feature extraction with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) for sequence modeling. The model integrates attention mechanisms to enhance pattern recognition in social network (SN) datasets. To improve transparency and trustworthiness, Explainable AI techniques using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to interpret the prediction outcomes and validate model reliability. The framework was trained and evaluated on a publicly available dataset, utilizing multiple performance metrics for a thorough assessment. Experimental results demonstrated the model’s effectiveness, achieving an accuracy of 93.97%. Furthermore, the study includes a comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method. Overall, the integration of CNN, BiGRU, attention mechanisms, and SHAP contributes to a robust and interpretable solution for suicide risk detection in social media contexts, potentially aiding early intervention strategies. <div>

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

<div> Keywords: LLM agents, structured uncertainty, tool-call parameters, POMDP, clarification questions<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of ambiguous user instructions in large language model (LLM) agents that perform tool-calling tasks, which often cause incorrect invocations and task failures. The authors propose a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, treating joint tool-argument clarification as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that optimizes question selection using the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) and incorporates aspect-based cost modeling to avoid redundant clarifications. Their SAGE-Agent leverages this model of uncertainty to improve efficiency significantly, enhancing task coverage on ambiguous inputs by 7-39% and reducing the number of clarification questions by 1.5 to 2.7 times compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baseline methods. The authors introduce ClarifyBench, a novel multi-turn benchmark for tool-augmented disambiguation that uses realistic LLM-based user simulation and covers multiple domains such as document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Furthermore, they demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides valuable training signals for reinforcement learning, with uncertainty-weighted GRPO training boosting the When2Call accuracy substantially — from 36.5% to 65.2% for a 3-billion parameter model and from 36.7% to 62.9% for a 7-billion parameter model. These findings establish structured uncertainty as an effective and principled approach for enhancing task success rates and interaction efficiency in real-world LLM-agent applications. <div>

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

Summary: 
- The study aims to understand how individuals with Parkinson's disease describe their cognitive experiences through natural language processing (NLP) models.
- Three model families were evaluated: Bio_ClinicalBERT, Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and GPT-4o mini, for extracting seven cognitive categories from patient narratives.
- The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model performed the best with high F1-scores, particularly excelling in context-dependent categories like thought and social interaction.
- Bio_ClinicalBERT showed high precision but low recall, performing well in some categories like location and time but failing in others such as thought, emotion, and social interaction.
- The task of extracting cognitive processes from narratives is challenging due to the abstract and overlapping nature, but with refinement, NLP systems show promise in monitoring cognitive function longitudinally in Parkinson's disease patients and supplementing formal neuropsychological assessments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

<title>Beyond Task-Oriented and Chitchat Dialogues: Proactive and Transition-Aware Conversational Agents</title>

<div> Keywords: conversational agents, task-oriented dialogue, chitchat, mode transition, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the longstanding challenge of unifying task-oriented dialogue (TOD) and open-ended chitchat in conversational agents, which traditionally are developed separately. Real-world conversations naturally transition fluidly between these modes, yet prior models lack robust mechanisms for handling such transitions. To bridge this gap, the authors introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a novel dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling. TACT incorporates structurally diverse and integrated conversational flows supporting both user- and agent-driven switches between TOD and chitchat, enabling the training of agents that better manage complex dialogue dynamics. To evaluate agent performance on mode transitions, the paper proposes two new metrics: Switch, measuring the detection of mode transitions, and Recovery, assessing the agent's ability to recover from such transitions effectively. Models trained on TACT outperform baseline models in intent detection and mode transition handling, demonstrating the dataset’s efficacy. Furthermore, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a preference-based training technique, on TACT-trained models yields additional improvements. The best model achieves a joint mode-intent accuracy of 75.74% and attains a 70.1% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluations. These findings suggest that combining diverse transition data with DPO fine-tuning significantly improves response quality and transition control, advancing the development of proactive, transition-aware conversational agents. <div>

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

BioVerge introduces a benchmark dataset and an LLM-based agent framework for standardized biomedical hypothesis generation. The dataset includes structured and textual data from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with Generation and Evaluation modules for proposing and self-assessing hypotheses. Experiments highlight the influence of agent architectures on exploration diversity and reasoning strategies, the importance of structured and textual information sources, and the benefits of self-evaluation for generating novel and relevant hypotheses. <div>

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

<title>Hallucinate or Memorize? The Two Sides of Probabilistic Learning in Large Language Models</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, hallucination, citation frequency, memorization, factual accuracy<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study examines how large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, handle bibliographic citation generation and the tendency to hallucinate non-existent papers. It hypothesizes that an LLM's accuracy in producing bibliographic records depends on whether the information is memorized from frequent appearances in training data or generated anew. The research uses citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy, assuming that highly cited papers are more likely to appear in the pretraining corpus. By generating 100 citations across twenty computer science domains and verifying them manually, researchers measured factual consistency through cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results showed a strong positive correlation between citation count and factual accuracy, with papers cited over roughly 1,000 times being almost memorized verbatim by the model. However, the presence of multiple highly cited papers with similar content led to memory interference, which affected recall accuracy. These findings suggest a threshold where an LLM shifts from generalizing to memorizing information, identifying highly cited works as nearly verbatim retained within the model’s internal knowledge. This points to both opportunities and challenges in citation recommendation systems using LLMs, emphasizing citation frequency as a critical factor in reducing hallucinated references. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Diffusion language models, Autoregressive models, TiDAR, Parallel generation, Structured attention masks<br /><br />Summary:  
1. Diffusion language models enable fast parallel token generation, but autoregressive (AR) models usually provide higher quality because their causal, left-to-right structure aligns naturally with language tasks.  
2. Existing approaches either rely on weaker AR-like drafting models, reducing drafting efficiency, or apply sequential decoding to diffusion models, losing quality and parallelizability benefits.  
3. TiDAR is proposed as a novel hybrid architecture combining diffusion-based token drafting ("Thinking") and autoregressive final sampling ("Talking") within a single forward pass using structured attention masks.  
4. This design maximizes GPU utilization by balancing token drafting and verification without significant overhead, making TiDAR practical for deployment as a standalone model.  
5. Extensive evaluation at 1.5B and 8B parameter scales shows TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in throughput, surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality, and uniquely closes the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x higher token generation speed. <div>
arXiv:2511.08923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

<div> framework, NLP models, human label variation, annotation errors, large language models

Summary:
The study introduces a new framework called EVADE for detecting errors in natural language inference tasks using large language models (LLMs). It aims to address human label variation (HLV) by generating and validating explanations to identify errors. The framework is compared to the earlier VARIERR framework, which requires two rounds of manual annotation. The study shows that LLM validation can refine explanation distributions to better align with human annotations. Removing errors detected by LLMs leads to improved fine-tuning performance compared to errors identified by human annotators. This research highlights the potential for scaling error detection and improving dataset quality while reducing human effort in handling label variation. <div>
arXiv:2511.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

<div> Emotional support, large language models, evaluation, trajectory-based assessment, user-centered perspective <br />
<br />
Summary: This research introduces a new framework for evaluating the emotional support capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through trajectory-based assessment. The study focuses on the long-term and dynamic nature of emotional support in human-AI interaction, moving away from static evaluations. A benchmark is created with various emotional contexts and disturbance events to simulate realistic emotional shifts during evolving dialogue scenarios. The framework incorporates validated emotion regulation strategies to guide model responses towards psychologically grounded outcomes. User emotional trajectories are modeled using a first-order Markov process, and causally-adjusted emotion estimation is applied for unbiased emotional state tracking. Three trajectory-level metrics are introduced to capture user emotional dynamics over time: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). Evaluations across different LLMs show significant disparities in emotional support capabilities, providing valuable insights for model development. <div>

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel two-stage neurosymbolic framework to address the stochastic limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in regulated industries like finance and healthcare. The framework involves using LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies and conducting inference-time autoformalization to ensure logical correctness. Multiple redundant formalization steps are performed at inference time to cross-check for semantic equivalence, resulting in over 99% soundness and near-zero false positive rates in identifying logical validity. The approach generates auditable logical artifacts that validate verification outcomes and can enhance the original text. This framework provides a mechanism for fine-grained control over the formalization process and offers a reliable solution for ensuring the accuracy and compliance of natural language statements in regulated sectors.

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

<div> Keywords: streaming speech recognition, Amdo Tibetan, hybrid CTC/Attention architecture, dynamic chunking mechanism, lexicon construction

Summary: 
A new streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan is proposed in this work. It utilizes a hybrid CTC/Attention architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism that adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states for flexible receptive fields. By addressing the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods, the framework adapts well to varying speaking rates. A lexicon based on Tibetan orthographic principles is constructed for linguistically motivated modeling units. The integration of an external language model during decoding enhances semantic consistency and improves recognition of longer sentences. Experimental results demonstrate a significant 48.15% relative improvement in word error rate (WER) over the fixed-chunk baseline, achieving a WER of 6.23% on the test set. The framework also reduces recognition latency while maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

<div> Keywords: retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning framework, bidirectional information distance, multi-objective reinforcement learning, question answering benchmarks

Summary:
Bi-RAR is a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that addresses limitations in complex reasoning scenarios by evaluating intermediate steps in both forward and backward directions. It introduces a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity to measure the completeness of each step in addressing the question and approaching the answer. To optimize reasoning, a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework is used with a cascading reward structure emphasizing early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks show that Bi-RAR outperforms previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference. This approach mitigates hallucinations in large language models and enhances response quality by providing explicit guidance for intermediate steps, thereby avoiding reward hacking and leading to improved performance in multi-step reasoning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

<div> Keywords: Computational humor, Natural Language Processing, Oogiri, Large Language Models, Empathy <br />
Summary: <br />
- The paper focuses on evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games.
- A multifaceted understanding of humor is essential, and the study systematically evaluates LLMs across dimensions like Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness.
- LLMs can generate Oogiri responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance but exhibit a notable lack of Empathy compared to humans.
- The lack of Empathy in LLMs explains their failure to replicate human humor assessment, as they prioritize Novelty while humans prioritize Empathy in humor evaluation.
- The annotated corpus created in this study is released to the community to facilitate the development of emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces a novel approach to personalized learning in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education by generating customized reading comprehension tests that cater to individual student interests. The authors develop a structured content transcreation pipeline utilizing OpenAI's gpt-4o, starting from the RACE-C dataset. This pipeline produces new reading passages and multiple-choice questions that preserve the linguistic style of the originals while aligning semantically with learners' specific interests. The methodology incorporates several key components, including topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and the content transcreation process itself. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a controlled experiment is conducted with EFL learners in South Korea. The study's findings reveal that students engaging with personalized reading materials demonstrate better reading comprehension performance and maintain higher motivation levels compared to peers using non-personalized content. Overall, the research highlights the potential of leveraging AI-driven content personalization to enhance both engagement and learning outcomes in EFL reading comprehension. <div>

We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

Summary: 
LoopTool introduces a closed-loop framework for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. The framework consists of three modules: Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses model capabilities, Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) corrects annotation errors, and Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new challenging samples. By iteratively refining data and models, LoopTool outperforms a 32B data generator and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like BFCL-v3 and ACEBench. The cost-effective, open-source ecosystem eliminates reliance on expensive closed-source APIs. This approach demonstrates the potential for closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines to boost LLM tool-use capabilities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Summary:<br /><br />
- Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used in Table Question Answering (TQA) to extract information from tables in documents.

- The approach selects the answer based on the most relevant row and column intersection.
- The language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to improve performance.
- Experimental results on the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18 showed an accuracy of 74.6%, outperforming existing LLMs like GPT-4o mini (63.9%).
- Future work will focus on incorporating more efficient text-search models to further enhance performance and approach human evaluation results.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, sequentiality, contextual terms, essay scoring, discourse traits  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. This paper addresses the critique of a previously proposed metric called sequentiality, which combined topic and contextual terms to quantify narrative flow using Large Language Models (LLMs).  
2. The critique suggested that the topic selection confounded original results and recommended using only the contextual term for a more valid and interpretable measure.  
3. The authors empirically validate this proposal by testing it on two essay datasets, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, both containing human-annotated trait scores related to discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion.  
4. Results show that the contextual-only measure of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments compared to the original and topic-only versions.  
5. Although zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately on their own, combining the contextual sequentiality measure with standard linguistic features yields higher predictive value than the original and topic-only metrics, even outperforming zero-shot LLM predictions alone.  
6. The findings underscore the importance of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow and support the contextual measure as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and other NLP applications. <div>
arXiv:2511.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

<div> Keywords: subword segmentation, language model, pretraining, finetuning, morphology <br />

Summary: 
The study explores the learning dynamics of subword segmentation in language models, focusing on how subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning. The subword segmental language model (SSLM) framework is extended to support pretraining and finetuning for typologically diverse languages: Isi-Xhosa, Setswana, and English. Four stages of subword learning are identified, with isi-Xhosa showing greater instability due to its morphological complexity. During finetuning, subword boundaries become finer-grained. The research highlights the potential of learnable subwords in improving text generation and cross-lingual transfer, particularly for low-resource, morphologically complex languages. <div>
arXiv:2511.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

<div> Reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards, honesty alignment, deductive reasoning, Anchor <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces the concept of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. It focuses on honesty alignment, where models must not only answer queries but also recognize when conclusions cannot be drawn from given premises. To test honesty alignment, two deductive reasoning datasets are curated, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference. The study finds that current methods struggle with these tasks and proposes a new reinforcement learning method called Anchor. Anchor injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse and improving reasoning performance. The results highlight the importance of training dynamics for reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

<div> Keywords: Speech Large Language Models, Optimal Transport, cross-lingual alignment, speech-to-text translation, zero-shot languages<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of biased translation performance in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT) caused by neglecting semantic commonalities across source languages. The authors propose a novel framework named POTSA (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment) that leverages cross-lingual parallel speech pairs combined with Optimal Transport (OT) techniques to enhance alignment between high- and low-resource languages. The approach includes a Bias Compensation module designed to coarsely align initial speech representations among different languages, reducing initial disparities. Subsequently, token-level OT constraints are applied to a Q-Former module using parallel speech pairs to establish detailed consistency of speech representations at the token level. Additionally, the framework incorporates a layer scheduling strategy that applies OT constraints selectively to the layers most beneficial for capturing semantic information. Experiments conducted on the FLEURS dataset demonstrate that POTSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, showing an average improvement of +0.93 BLEU across five common languages. Remarkably, it also yields a substantial +5.05 BLEU increase in zero-shot language settings, all while requiring only 10 hours of parallel speech data per source language. This work presents an effective solution to bridging translation quality gaps for low-resource and unseen languages. <div>

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

<div> Keywords: large language models, multi-attribute control, text generation, conflict resolution, iterative optimization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of controlling multiple specific attributes in generated text by large language models (LLMs) without needing architectural changes or extensive fine-tuning.<br />2. Existing methods primarily allow control over single, basic attributes and struggle when multiple, potentially conflicting attributes are required, lacking coordination and iterative refinement mechanisms.<br />3. The authors propose C³TG (Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation), a novel two-phase framework designed for fine-grained control over multiple text attributes simultaneously.<br />4. During the generation phase, C³TG dynamically pairs the LLM with relevant attribute classifiers (covering 17 dimensions) and applies weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities, guiding generation toward desired attribute profiles.<br />5. In the optimization phase, an energy function combining classifier feedback and penalty terms iteratively resolves conflicts among attributes to refine outputs, ensuring natural text fluency is preserved.<br />6. Experimental results demonstrate that C³TG outperforms baseline approaches in attribute accuracy, linguistic quality, diversity of generated text, and also reduces toxicity.<br />7. The framework achieves precise multi-dimensional attribute control without requiring costly model modifications, making it an effective and flexible solution for controlled text generation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Creative writing, personalization, large language models, reading preferences, dataset<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces LiteraryTaste, a novel dataset designed to support the development of personalized creative writing language models by capturing individual reading preferences. The dataset involves 60 participants who provided two types of preference data: 1) self-reported reading habits and tastes, termed stated preferences, and 2) annotations of their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts, referred to as revealed preferences. Key findings include the observation that people's creative writing preferences significantly diverge, highlighting the importance of personalization. The authors demonstrate that fine-tuning a transformer encoder on this data achieves 75.8% accuracy in predicting personal preferences and 67.7% accuracy for collective preferences, suggesting effective modeling of individual and group tastes. However, stated preferences showed limited predictive power for revealed preferences, indicating that what people say about their tastes might not align well with their actual choices. Additionally, the study uses an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline to analyze variations in preferences, providing insights into how creativity is perceived differently across users. This work establishes a foundation for further research toward tailoring creative writing technologies to better match individual user tastes and improve user satisfaction. <div>
arXiv:2511.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

<div> Khmer polarity classification, explainable AI, Qwen-3 model, polarity dataset, self-explanations<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the task of Khmer polarity classification, which involves categorizing Khmer text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Unlike prior models that perform classification without explanation, the authors propose an explainable approach by fine-tuning the instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The explainability emphasized in this work is based on self-explanations, where the model provides rationale by highlighting polarity-related keywords or phrases that justify its predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Qwen-3 model not only achieves accurate polarity classification but also offers interpretable reasoning for its decisions. Additionally, the authors contribute a new dataset tailored for this task, containing short to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using a combination of heuristic rules and human curation to ensure quality and diversity. Both the dataset and the fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are made publicly accessible via a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). This work advances Khmer language processing by combining effective sentiment analysis with explainability support. <div>

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

Summary:
The article introduces AdaptDel methods for certified robustness in sequence classification against edit distance perturbations, particularly for natural language processing tasks. Current methods face challenges with inputs of varying lengths, leading to suboptimal performance. AdaptDel methods use adaptable deletion rates that adjust dynamically based on input properties. The theoretical framework of randomized smoothing is extended to variable-rate deletion to ensure sound certification with respect to edit distance. Empirical results in natural language tasks show significant improvement, with up to 30 orders of magnitude enhancement in the median cardinality of the certified region compared to state-of-the-art certifications. <div>

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

<div> Keywords: vision-language models, scientific reasoning, mmJEE-Eval, JEE Advanced, multimodal benchmark<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This paper introduces mmJEE-Eval, a new challenging multimodal bilingual benchmark in English and Hindi, consisting of 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced exam (2019-2025) covering Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. <br />2. The benchmark aims to better differentiate genuine scientific reasoning capabilities from mere pattern-matching in contemporary vision-language models (VLMs), addressing limitations in existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks.<br />3. Evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art VLMs shows that top closed-source models such as GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash achieve high accuracy (77-84%) on the latest 2025 questions, while large open-source models plateau at 37-45% accuracy despite scaling to 400 billion parameters.<br />4. Closed models demonstrate excellent problem-solving performance, with up to 100% pass@3 scores, but their reasoning ability drastically declines under meta-cognitive stress tests; for instance, GPT-5 only corrects 5.2% of its errors.<br />5. Ablation studies confirm that mmJEE-Eval's difficulty arises from question complexity and reasoning depth, not from data memorization, making it an effective benchmark for distinguishing advanced reasoning and training methods versus weaker alternatives.<br />6. The authors publicly release the benchmark's code and dataset at https://mmjee-eval.github.io for broader research use. <div>
arXiv:2511.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

Summary:
The paper introduces SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that enhances token efficiency and reduces latency in Large Language Models. By integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning, the framework uses System 1 for quick computation of answer entropy, which is then used to assess the suitability of samples for scaling under System 2. This approach enables dynamic self-consistency while benefiting from System 1's accurate estimations. The method surpasses existing techniques by achieving a remarkable 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% decrease in inference latency without compromising performance. By leveraging both rapid and accurate reasoning systems, SeerSC improves overall inference performance and efficiency of LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher).

<div> Keywords: multilingual text evaluation, large language models, MTQ-Eval, text quality assessment, preference learning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating text quality in multilingual settings using large language models (LLMs). It introduces MTQ-Eval, a new evaluation framework designed to assess text quality across 115 languages by learning from examples of both high- and low-quality text. To create MTQ-Eval, the authors automatically generate data reflecting quality preferences, which is then used to fine-tune open-source base LLMs so they align better with human-like judgments of text quality. The study presents a comprehensive evaluation demonstrating MTQ-Eval’s superior performance over existing approaches in multiple languages. Additionally, the authors find that the improved evaluation capability of MTQ-Eval not only enhances quality assessment tasks but also contributes to better results in related downstream tasks. This suggests that multilingual text quality evaluation using aligned LLMs is both feasible and beneficial. The work highlights the potential for scalable, generalizable text quality evaluation beyond specific task-focused metrics, offering robust multilingual support. Overall, MTQ-Eval represents an important step toward more accurate and universal text quality assessment using LLMs trained on preference data. <div>

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Summary: 
This paper investigates the self-correction mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) for open-ended text generation and multiple-choice selection tasks. It compares performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks using different scales and families of language models. The study reveals that open-ended generation benefits from re-interpretation and compositional refinement, while multiple-choice selection relies on clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by provided options. The findings emphasize the importance of considering task structure and output space interaction in designing self-correction mechanisms for knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented LLM applications.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO) as a solution to the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma in aligning language models using offline preference optimization. The current margin designs lead to excessive gradients for correctly ranked samples (overfitting) and insufficient signals for misranked ones (underfitting). AMaPO addresses this issue by utilizing an adaptive margin that reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correctly ranked ones. Experimental results show that AMaPO improves ranking accuracy and downstream alignment performance compared to existing methods. The algorithm successfully mitigates overfitting and underfitting issues, providing a more effective and stable approach for aligning language models. <div>
arXiv:2511.09385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

<title>GSAP-ERE: Fine-Grained Scholarly Entity and Relation Extraction Focused on Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

<title>Readability Measures and Automatic Text Simplification: In the Search of a Construct</title>

Abstract: Readability is a key concept in the current era of abundant written information. To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment. We argue that as the three different angles from which simplification can be assessed tend to exhibit rather low correlations with one another, there is a need for a clear definition of the construct in ATS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context windows promise direct reasoning over long documents, reducing the need for chunking or retrieval. Constructing annotated resources for training and evaluation, however, remains costly. Synthetic data offers a scalable alternative, and we introduce SynClaimEval, a framework for evaluating synthetic data utility in long-context claim verification -- a task central to hallucination detection and fact-checking. Our framework examines three dimensions: (i) input characteristics, by varying context length and testing generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks; (ii) synthesis logic, by controlling claim complexity and error type variation; and (iii) explanation quality, measuring the degree to which model explanations provide evidence consistent with predictions. Experiments across benchmarks show that long-context synthesis can improve verification in base instruction-tuned models, particularly when augmenting existing human-written datasets. Moreover, synthesis enhances explanation quality, even when verification scores do not improve, underscoring its potential to strengthen both performance and explainability.

<title>Conversational Agents for Building Energy Efficiency -- Advising Housing Cooperatives in Stockholm on Reducing Energy Consumption</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08587</link>

Abstract: Housing cooperative is a common type of multifamily building ownership in Sweden. Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice.

<title>Accelerating Training Speed of Tiny Recursive Models via Curriculum Guided Adaptive Recursion</title>

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Abstract: This paper analyses AI-generated podcasts produced by Google's NotebookLM, which generates audio podcasts with two chatty AI hosts discussing whichever documents a user uploads. While AI-generated podcasts have been discussed as tools, for instance in medical education, they have not yet been analysed as media. By uploading different types of text and analysing the generated outputs I show how the podcasts' structure is built around a fixed template. I also find that NotebookLM not only translates texts from other languages into a perky standardised Mid-Western American accent, it also translates cultural contexts to a white, educated, middle-class American default. This is a distinct development in how publics are shaped by media, marking a departure from the multiple public spheres that scholars have described in human podcasting from the early 2000s until today, where hosts spoke to specific communities and responded to listener comments, to an abstraction of the podcast genre.

<title>Benevolent Dictators? On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games</title>

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

<title>BayesQ: Uncertainty-Guided Bayesian Quantization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

Abstract: We present TransactionGPT (TGPT), a foundation model for consumer transaction data within one of world's largest payment networks. TGPT is designed to understand and generate transaction trajectories while simultaneously supporting a variety of downstream prediction and classification tasks. We introduce a novel 3D-Transformer architecture specifically tailored for capturing the complex dynamics in payment transaction data. This architecture incorporates design innovations that enhance modality fusion and computational efficiency, while seamlessly enabling joint optimization with downstream objectives. Trained on billion-scale real-world transactions, TGPT significantly improves downstream classification performance against a competitive production model and exhibits advantages over baselines in generating future transactions. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations utilizing a diverse collection of company transaction datasets spanning multiple downstream tasks, thereby enabling a thorough assessment of TGPT's effectiveness and efficiency in comparison to established methodologies. Furthermore, we examine the incorporation of LLM-derived embeddings within TGPT and benchmark its performance against fine-tuned LLMs, demonstrating that TGPT achieves superior predictive accuracy as well as faster training and inference. We anticipate that the architectural innovations and practical guidelines from this work will advance foundation models for transaction-like data and catalyze future research in this emerging field.

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spoken question answering (SQA) in recent years. However, many existing methods, including large audio language models, struggle with processing long audio. Follow the success of retrieval augmented generation, a speech-related retriever shows promising in help preprocessing long-form speech. But the performance of existing speech-related retrievers is lacking. To address this challenge, we propose CLSR, an end-to-end contrastive language-speech retriever that efficiently extracts question-relevant segments from long audio recordings for downstream SQA task. Unlike conventional speech-text contrastive models, CLSR incorporates an intermediate step that converts acoustic features into text-like representations prior to alignment, thereby more effectively bridging the gap between modalities. Experimental results across four cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that CLSR surpasses both end-to-end speech related retrievers and pipeline approaches combining speech recognition with text retrieval, providing a robust foundation for advancing practical long-form SQA applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Abstract: LLMs now tackle a wide range of software-related tasks, yet we show that their performance varies markedly both across and within these tasks. Routing user queries to the appropriate LLMs can therefore help improve response quality while reducing cost. Prior work, however, has focused mainly on general-purpose LLM routing via black-box models. We introduce Routesplain, the first LLM router for software-related tasks, including multilingual code generation and repair, input/output prediction, and computer science QA. Unlike existing routing approaches, Routesplain first extracts human-interpretable concepts from each query (e.g., task, domain, reasoning complexity) and only routes based on these concepts, thereby providing intelligible, faithful rationales. We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Abstract: Conversation is a subject of increasing interest in the social, cognitive, and computational sciences. Yet as conversational datasets continue to increase in size and complexity, researchers lack scalable methods to segment speech-to-text transcripts into conversational "turns"-the basic building blocks of social interaction. We discuss this challenge and then introduce "NaturalTurn," a turn-segmentation algorithm designed to accurately capture the dynamics of conversational exchange. NaturalTurn operates by distinguishing speakers' primary conversational turns from listeners' secondary utterances, such as backchannels, brief interjections, and other forms of parallel speech that characterize human conversation. Using data from a large conversation corpus, we show that NaturalTurn captures conversational turns more accurately than a baseline model. For example, it produces turns with durations and gaps that match empirical literature, reveals stronger linguistic alignment patterns between speakers, and uncovers otherwise hidden relationships between turn-taking and affective outcomes. NaturalTurn thus represents a pragmatic development in machine-generated transcript-processing methods, or "turn models", that will enable researchers to link turn-taking dynamics with important outcomes of social interaction, a central goal of conversation science.

Abstract: Machine unlearning has emerged as an important component in developing safe and trustworthy models. Prior work on fact unlearning in LLMs has mostly focused on removing a specified target fact robustly, but often overlooks its deductive connections to other knowledge. We propose a new setting for fact unlearning, deep unlearning, where the goal is not only to remove a target fact but also to prevent it from being deduced via retained knowledge in the LLM and logical reasoning. We propose three novel metrics: Success-DU and Recall to measure unlearning efficacy, and Accuracy to measure the remainder model utility. To benchmark this setting, we leverage both (1) an existing real-world knowledge dataset, MQuAKE, that provides one-step deduction instances, and (2) newly construct a novel semi-synthetic dataset, Eval-DU, that allows multiple steps of realistic deductions among synthetic facts. Experiments reveal that current methods struggle with deep unlearning: they either fail to deeply unlearn, or excessively remove unrelated facts. Our results suggest that targeted algorithms may have to be developed for robust/deep fact unlearning in LLMs.

Abstract: With the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, evaluating these models' performance using benchmark datasets has become crucial. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of various benchmark datasets employed in medical LLM tasks. These datasets span multiple modalities including text, image, and multimodal benchmarks, focusing on different aspects of medical knowledge such as electronic health records (EHRs), doctor-patient dialogues, medical question-answering, and medical image captioning. The survey categorizes the datasets by modality, discussing their significance, data structure, and impact on the development of LLMs for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, report generation, and predictive decision support. Key benchmarks include MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, BioASQ, PubMedQA, and CheXpert, which have facilitated advancements in tasks like medical report generation, clinical summarization, and synthetic data generation. The paper summarizes the challenges and opportunities in leveraging these benchmarks for advancing multimodal medical intelligence, emphasizing the need for datasets with a greater degree of language diversity, structured omics data, and innovative approaches to synthesis. This work also provides a foundation for future research in the application of LLMs in medicine, contributing to the evolving field of medical artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama has significantly transformed natural language processing, showcasing remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language. However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: these models often struggle with tasks requiring complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving. This deficiency stems from the critical scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for cultivating sophisticated reasoning abilities. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel and scalable paradigm that harnesses frontier LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which in turn synthesize a virtually infinite stream of high-quality problems and solutions. Using this paradigm, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a foundational dataset of over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems. Each problem is accompanied by a programmatically verifiable solution, offering an unprecedented level of quality at scale. This resource not only resolves the data scarcity issue for supervised fine-tuning but also provides a robust mechanism for model alignment through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Our approach elevates data augmentation by leveraging GPT-4 to generate meta-templates, ensuring diverse and complex problem structures. By providing a scalable solution to the data and verification bottleneck, TDG and TemplateGSM pave the way for a new generation of LLMs with powerful, reliable reasoning skills.

Abstract: Reward Modeling is critical in evaluating and improving the generation of Large Language Models (LLMs). While numerous recent works have shown its feasibility in improving safety, helpfulness, reasoning, and instruction-following ability, its capability and generalization to open-ended long-context generation is still rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce OpenGenAlign, a framework and a high-quality dataset designed to develop reward models to evaluate and improve hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient open-ended long-context generation. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across long-context QA, Data-to-Text, and Summarization scenarios using o3, ending up with 33K high-quality preference data with a human agreement rate of 81\%. Experimental results first demonstrate that existing reward models perform suboptimally on the held-out benchmark. And Our trained reward model achieves superior performance in the benchmark and effectively improves the generation quality of the policy models using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Additionally, OpenGenAlign could be used for effective guided generation in existing datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the OpenGenAlign could be integrated with reward data from other domains to achieve better performance.

Abstract: Language models can produce fluent, grammatical text. Nonetheless, some maintain that language models don't really learn language and also that, even if they did, that would not be informative for the study of human learning and processing. On the other side, there have been claims that the success of LMs obviates the need for studying linguistic theory and structure. We argue that both extremes are wrong. LMs can contribute to fundamental questions about linguistic structure, language processing, and learning. They force us to rethink arguments and ways of thinking that have been foundational in linguistics. While they do not replace linguistic structure and theory, they serve as model systems and working proofs of concept for gradient, usage-based approaches to language. We offer an optimistic take on the relationship between language models and linguistics.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing other existing FL methods.

Abstract: Argument mining algorithms analyze the argumentative structure of essays, making them a valuable tool for enhancing education by providing targeted feedback on the students' argumentation skills. While current methods often use encoder or encoder-decoder deep learning architectures, decoder-only models remain largely unexplored, offering a promising research direction.
  This paper proposes leveraging open-source, small Large Language Models (LLMs) for argument mining through few-shot prompting and fine-tuning. These models' small size and open-source nature ensure accessibility, privacy, and computational efficiency, enabling schools and educators to adopt and deploy them locally. Specifically, we perform three tasks: segmentation of student essays into arguments, classification of the arguments by type, and assessment of their quality. We empirically evaluate the models on the Feedback Prize - Predicting Effective Arguments dataset of grade 6-12 students essays and demonstrate how fine-tuned small LLMs outperform baseline methods in segmenting the essays and determining the argument types while few-shot prompting yields comparable performance to that of the baselines in assessing quality. This work highlights the educational potential of small, open-source LLMs to provide real-time, personalized feedback, enhancing independent learning and writing skills while ensuring low computational cost and privacy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks by encoding vast amounts of factual knowledge. However, they are still prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or misleading information, often accompanied by high uncertainty. Existing methods for hallucination detection primarily focus on quantifying internal uncertainty, which arises from missing or conflicting knowledge within the model. However, hallucinations can also stem from external uncertainty, where ambiguous user queries lead to multiple possible interpretations. In this work, we introduce Semantic Volume, a novel mathematical measure for quantifying both external and internal uncertainty in LLMs. Our approach perturbs queries and responses, embeds them in a semantic space, and computes the Gram matrix determinant of the embedding vectors, capturing their dispersion as a measure of uncertainty. Our framework provides a generalizable and unsupervised uncertainty detection method without requiring internal access to LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on both external and internal uncertainty detections, demonstrating that our Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights linking our measure to differential entropy, unifying and extending previous sampling-based uncertainty measures such as the semantic entropy. Semantic Volume is shown to be a robust and interpretable approach to improving the reliability of LLMs by systematically detecting uncertainty in both user queries and model responses.

Abstract: While voice technologies increasingly serve aging populations, current systems exhibit significant performance gaps due to inadequate training data capturing elderly-specific vocal characteristics like presbyphonia and dialectal variations. The limited data available on super-aged individuals in existing elderly speech datasets, coupled with overly simple recording styles and annotation dimensions, exacerbates this issue. To address the critical scarcity of speech data from individuals aged 75 and above, we introduce SeniorTalk, a carefully annotated Chinese spoken dialogue dataset. This dataset contains 55.53 hours of speech from 101 natural conversations involving 202 participants, ensuring a strategic balance across gender, region, and age. Through detailed annotation across multiple dimensions, it can support a wide range of speech tasks. We perform extensive experiments on speaker verification, speaker diarization, speech recognition, and speech editing tasks, offering crucial insights for the development of speech technologies targeting this age group.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically operate in a question-answering paradigm, where the quality of the input prompt critically affects the response. Automated Prompt Optimization (APO) aims to overcome the cognitive biases of manually crafted prompts and explore a broader prompt design space. However, existing APO methods often suffer from rigid template structures and inefficient exploration in the prompt space. To this end, we propose a Multi-Agent Adaptive Reasoning with Socratic guidance framework (MARS) for APO. MARS consists of five complementary agents and formulates the optimization process as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), enabling adaptive prompt refinement through explicit state modeling and interactive feedback. Specifically, a Planner agent generates flexible optimization trajectories, a Teacher-Critic-Student triad engages in Socratic-style dialogue to iteratively optimize the prompt based on pseudo-gradient signals in the text space, and a Target agent executes the prompt in downstream tasks to provide performance feedback. MARS integrates reasoning, feedback, and state transition into a unified hidden-state evolution process, improving both the effectiveness and interpretability of optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that MARS outperforms existing APO methods in terms of optimization performance, search efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a signal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also has no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of the emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours that have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such feedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was intended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how communication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we present a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an unbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural differences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine communicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this outcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of psychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared intentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of communication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible socially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a general but well-developed capacity for social cognition.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we outline a versatile framework for closed-book hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we propose a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to reduce faithfulness hallucinations of LLMs across different downstream tasks without human annotations. Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different tasks, even outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following capabilities in text-based tasks. However, this ability often deteriorates in multimodal models after alignment with non-text modalities such as images or audio. While several recent efforts have investigated instruction-following performance in text and vision-language models, instruction-following in audio-based large language models remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce IFEval-Audio, a novel evaluation dataset designed to assess the ability to follow instructions in an audio LLM. IFEval-Audio contains 280 audio-instruction-answer triples across six diverse dimensions: Content, Capitalization, Symbol, List Structure, Length, and Format. Each example pairs an audio input with a text instruction, requiring the model to generate an output that follows a specified structure. We benchmark state-of-the-art audio LLMs on their ability to follow audio-involved instructions. The dataset is released publicly to support future research in this emerging area.

<title>LLMs Struggle to Reject False Presuppositions when Misinformation Stakes are High</title>

Abstract: This paper examines how LLMs handle false presuppositions and whether certain linguistic factors influence their responses to falsely presupposed content. Presuppositions subtly introduce information as given, making them highly effective at embedding disputable or false information. This raises concerns about whether LLMs, like humans, may fail to detect and correct misleading assumptions introduced as false presuppositions, even when the stakes of misinformation are high. Using a systematic approach based on linguistic presupposition analysis, we investigate the conditions under which LLMs are more or less sensitive to adopt or reject false presuppositions. Focusing on political contexts, we examine how factors like linguistic construction, political party, and scenario probability impact the recognition of false presuppositions. We conduct experiments with a newly created dataset and examine three LLMs: OpenAI's GPT-4-o, Meta's LLama-3-8B, and MistralAI's Mistral-7B-v03. Our results show that the models struggle to recognize false presuppositions, with performance varying by condition. This study highlights that linguistic presupposition analysis is a valuable tool for uncovering the reinforcement of political misinformation in LLM responses.

Abstract: Stealthy data poisoning during fine-tuning can backdoor large language models (LLMs), threatening downstream safety. Existing detectors either use classifier-style probability signals--ill-suited to generation--or rely on rewriting, which can degrade quality and even introduce new triggers. We address the practical need to efficiently remove poisoned examples before or during fine-tuning. We observe a robust signal in the response space: after applying TF-IDF to model responses, poisoned examples form compact clusters (driven by consistent malicious outputs), while clean examples remain dispersed. We leverage this with RFTC--Reference-Filtration + TF-IDF Clustering. RFTC first compares each example's response with that of a reference model and flags those with large deviations as suspicious; it then performs TF-IDF clustering on the suspicious set and identifies true poisoned examples using intra-class distance. On two machine translation datasets and one QA dataset, RFTC outperforms prior detectors in both detection accuracy and the downstream performance of the fine-tuned models. Ablations with different reference models further validate the effectiveness and robustness of Reference-Filtration.

Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/CuCl-2/anyECG-chat.

Abstract: Although demonstrating remarkable performance on reasoning tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) still tend to fabricate unreliable responses when confronted with problems that are unsolvable or beyond their capability, severely undermining the reliability. Prior studies of LLM reliability have primarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while mathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of unsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations. Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered. LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. The dataset contains 522 prompts and yields 4,099 human-annotated pairwise preferences from comparisons across five instruction-tuned LLMs. All annotations are natively written in Indonesian with strong inter-annotator agreement, measured by Krippendorff's alpha. Our benchmark spans 10 diverse categories, enabling practitioners to identify LLMs' fine-grained strengths and weaknesses.

Abstract: In this study, we report, for the first time, the discovery and systematic investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a pivotal role in the MoE LLMs' forward inference. These experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their extremely limited number, pruning them results in a substantial decline in model performance (e.g., prune just three out of 6,144 causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to generate repetitive and uninformative outputs).We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs: (i) SEs are characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs is model-specific, data-agnostic, and remains unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii) We further investigate why compressing SEs exerts such a pronounced impact. We show that, in MoE LLMs, SEs serve as the primary source of the systematic outlier mechanism in Transformers, and that compressing them profoundly disrupts this process, ultimately causing the collapse of attention sinks. These findings advance the understanding of the internal dynamics of MoE LLMs, filling an important gap in the current knowledge.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using 145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2, Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3 achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of real-world physician communication.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit logically inconsistent hallucinations that appear coherent yet violate reasoning principles, with recent research suggesting an inverse relationship between causal reasoning capabilities and such hallucinations. However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic token level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between variables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or satisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce causal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning framework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a dataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an input question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated answer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves the causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on CLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces the hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements. It demonstrates that explicit causal structure modeling in LLMs can effectively mitigate logical inconsistencies in LLM outputs. Code is available at https://github.com/MrLYG/CDCR-SFT.

<title>SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning</title>

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

Abstract: Context faithfulness is essential for reliable reasoning in context-dependent scenarios. However, large language models often struggle to ground their outputs in the provided context, resulting in irrelevant responses. Inspired by the emergent expert specialization observed in mixture-of-experts architectures, this work investigates whether certain experts exhibit specialization in context utilization, offering a potential pathway toward targeted optimization for improved context faithfulness. To explore this, we propose Router Lens, a method that accurately identifies context-faithful experts. Our analysis reveals that these experts progressively amplify attention to relevant contextual information, thereby enhancing context grounding. Building on this insight, we introduce Context-faithful Expert Fine-Tuning (CEFT), a lightweight optimization approach that selectively fine-tunes context-faithful experts. Experiments across a wide range of benchmarks and models demonstrate that CEFT matches or surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning while being significantly more efficient.

<title>Can Language Models Handle a Non-Gregorian Calendar? The Case of the Japanese wareki</title>

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar. However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of how well language models handle one such non-Gregorian system: the Japanese wareki. We create datasets that require temporal knowledge and reasoning in using wareki dates. Evaluating open and closed LMs, we find that some models can perform calendar conversions, but GPT-4o, Deepseek V3, and even Japanese-centric models struggle with Japanese calendar arithmetic and knowledge involving wareki dates. Error analysis suggests corpus frequency of Japanese calendar expressions and a Gregorian bias in the model's knowledge as possible explanations. Our results show the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped for culture-specific tasks such as calendar understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic, demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360 simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure equitable global access to higher education.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning plays a vital role in enhancing the task-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs), improving their usability in generating helpful responses on various tasks. However, previous work has demonstrated that they are sensitive to minor variations in instruction phrasing. In this paper, we explore whether introducing perturbations in instruction-tuning data can enhance LLMs' resistance against noisy instructions. We focus on how instruction-tuning with perturbations, such as removing stop words or shuffling words, affects LLMs' performance on the original and perturbed versions of widely-used benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GSM8K). We further assess learning dynamics and potential shifts in model behavior. Surprisingly, our results suggest that instruction-tuning on perturbed instructions can, in some cases, improve downstream performance. These findings highlight the importance of including perturbed instructions in instruction-tuning, which can make LLMs more resilient to noisy user inputs.

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to 2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of 1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Abstract: We tested over 20 Transformer models for ranking long documents (including recent LongP models trained with FlashAttention and RankGPT models "powered" by OpenAI and Anthropic cloud APIs). We compared them with the simple FirstP baseline, which applied the same model to truncated input (up to 512 tokens). On MS MARCO, TREC DL, and Robust04 no long-document model outperformed FirstP by more than 5% (on average). We hypothesized that this lack of improvement is not due to inherent model limitations, but due to benchmark positional bias (most relevant passages tend to occur early in documents), which is known to exist in MS MARCO. To confirm this, we analyzed positional relevance distributions across four long-document corpora (with six query sets) and observed the same early-position bias. Surprisingly, we also found bias in six BEIR collections, which are typically categorized as short-document datasets. We then introduced a new diagnostic dataset, MS MARCO FarRelevant, where relevant spans were deliberately placed beyond the first 512 tokens. On this dataset, many long-context models (including RankGPT) performed at random-baseline level, suggesting overfitting to positional bias. We also experimented with debiasing training data, but with limited success. Our findings (1) highlight the need for careful benchmark design in evaluating long-context models for document ranking, (2) identify model types that are more robust to positional bias, and (3) motivate further work on approaches to debias training data. We release our code and data to support further research.

Abstract: A prompt injection attack aims to inject malicious instruction/data into the input of an LLM-Integrated Application such that it produces results as an attacker desires. Existing works are limited to case studies. As a result, the literature lacks a systematic understanding of prompt injection attacks and their defenses. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. In particular, we propose a framework to formalize prompt injection attacks. Existing attacks are special cases in our framework. Moreover, based on our framework, we design a new attack by combining existing ones. Using our framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation on 5 prompt injection attacks and 10 defenses with 10 LLMs and 7 tasks. Our work provides a common benchmark for quantitatively evaluating future prompt injection attacks and defenses. To facilitate research on this topic, we make our platform public at https://github.com/liu00222/Open-Prompt-Injection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural language processing, showcasing exceptional performance across various tasks. However, the expensive memory and computational requirements present significant challenges for their practical deployment. Low-bit quantization has emerged as a critical approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing the bit-width of model parameters, activations, and gradients, thus decreasing memory usage and computational demands. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of low-bit quantization methods tailored for LLMs, covering the fundamental principles, system implementations, and algorithmic strategies. An overview of basic concepts and new data formats specific to low-bit LLMs is first introduced, followed by a review of frameworks and systems that facilitate low-bit LLMs across various hardware platforms. Then, we categorize and analyze techniques and toolkits for efficient low-bit training and inference of LLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future trends and potential advancements of low-bit LLMs. Our systematic overview from basic, system, and algorithm perspectives can offer valuable insights and guidelines for future works to enhance the efficiency and applicability of LLMs through low-bit quantization.

Abstract: With the broader adoption and highly successful development of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been growing interest and demand for applying LLMs to autonomous driving technology. Driven by their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs have the potential to enhance various aspects of autonomous driving systems, from perception and scene understanding to interactive decision-making. In this paper, we first introduce the novel concept of designing Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving (LLM4AD), followed by a review of existing LLM4AD studies. Then, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of LLM4AD systems, which includes LaMPilot-Bench, CARLA Leaderboard 1.0 Benchmark in simulation and NuPlanQA for multi-view visual question answering. Furthermore, we conduct extensive real-world experiments on autonomous vehicle platforms, examining both on-cloud and on-edge LLM deployment for personalized decision-making and motion control. Next, we explore the future trends of integrating language diffusion models into autonomous driving, exemplified by the proposed ViLaD (Vision-Language Diffusion) framework. Finally, we discuss the main challenges of LLM4AD, including latency, deployment, security and privacy, safety, trust and transparency, and personalization.

Abstract: With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly sensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists LLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge sources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking sensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore RAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The main challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate answers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an algorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require the sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our extensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the non-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\epsilon\approx 10$ across different models and datasets.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong performance but struggle when adapted to downstream tasks. Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient and effective strategy to adapt VLMs while preserving their pre-trained knowledge. However, existing methods still lead to overfitting and degrade zero-shot generalization. To address this challenge, we propose an optimal transport (OT)-guided prompt learning framework that mitigates forgetting by preserving the structural consistency of feature distributions between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Unlike conventional point-wise constraints, OT naturally captures cross-instance relationships and expands the feasible parameter space for prompt tuning, allowing a better trade-off between adaptation and generalization. Our approach enforces joint constraints on both vision and text representations, ensuring a holistic feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our simple yet effective method can outperform existing prompt learning strategies in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization without additional augmentation or ensemble techniques.

Abstract: Are traditional classification approaches irrelevant in this era of AI hype? We show that there are multiclass classification problems where predictive models holistically outperform LLM prompt-based frameworks. Given text and images from home-service project descriptions provided by Thumbtack customers, we build embeddings-based softmax models that predict the professional category (e.g., handyman, bathroom remodeling) associated with each problem description. We then compare against prompts that ask state-of-the-art LLM models to solve the same problem. We find that the embeddings approach outperforms the best LLM prompts in terms of accuracy, calibration, latency, and financial cost. In particular, the embeddings approach has 49.5\% higher accuracy than the prompting approach, and its superiority is consistent across text-only, image-only, and text-image problem descriptions. Furthermore, it yields well-calibrated probabilities, which we later use as confidence signals to provide contextualized user experience during deployment. On the contrary, prompting scores are overly uninformative. Finally, the embeddings approach is 14 and 81 times faster than prompting in processing images and text respectively, while under realistic deployment assumptions, it can be up to 10 times cheaper. Based on these results, we deployed a variation of the embeddings approach, and through A/B testing we observed performance consistent with our offline analysis. Our study shows that for multiclass classification problems that can leverage proprietary datasets, an embeddings-based approach may yield unequivocally better results. Hence, scientists, practitioners, engineers, and business leaders can use our study to go beyond the hype and consider appropriate predictive models for their classification use cases.

Abstract: Large language models have shown remarkable language processing and reasoning ability but are prone to hallucinate when asked about private data. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) retrieves relevant data that fit into an LLM's context window and prompts the LLM for an answer. GraphRAG extends this approach to structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and questions regarding entities multiple hops away. The majority of recent GraphRAG methods either overlook the retrieval step or have ad hoc retrieval processes that are abstract or inefficient. This prevents them from being adopted when the KGs are stored in graph databases supporting graph query languages. In this work, we present GraphRAFT, a retrieve-and-reason framework that finetunes LLMs to generate provably correct Cypher queries to retrieve high-quality subgraph contexts and produce accurate answers. Our method is the first such solution that can be taken off-the-shelf and used on KGs stored in native graph DBs. Benchmarks suggest that our method is sample-efficient and scales with the availability of training data. Our method achieves significantly better results than all state-of-the-art models across all four standard metrics on two challenging Q&amp;As on large text-attributed KGs.

<title>Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization: A Simple Value-Based Method for LLM Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15311</link>

arXiv:2505.15311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Few Shot Domain Adapting Graph (FS-DAG), a scalable and efficient model architecture for visually rich document understanding (VRDU) in few-shot settings. FS-DAG leverages domain-specific and language/vision specific backbones within a modular framework to adapt to diverse document types with minimal data. The model is robust to practical challenges such as handling OCR errors, misspellings, and domain shifts, which are critical in real-world deployments. FS-DAG is highly performant with less than 90M parameters, making it well-suited for complex real-world applications for Information Extraction (IE) tasks where computational resources are limited. We demonstrate FS-DAG's capability through extensive experiments for information extraction task, showing significant improvements in convergence speed and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, this work highlights the ongoing progress in developing smaller, more efficient models that do not compromise on performance. Code : https://github.com/oracle-samples/fs-dag

<title>Capturing Polysemanticity with PRISM: A Multi-Concept Feature Description Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15538</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.15538v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Within the context of large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP), current automated neuron-level feature description methods face two key challenges: limited robustness and the assumption that each neuron encodes a single concept (monosemanticity), despite increasing evidence of polysemanticity. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior. We apply PRISM to LLMs and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).

arXiv:2506.22493v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Political Compass Test (PCT) and similar surveys are commonly used to assess political bias in auto-regressive LLMs. Our rigorous statistical experiments show that while changes to standard generation parameters have minimal effect on PCT scores, prompt phrasing and fine-tuning individually and together can significantly influence results. Interestingly, fine-tuning on politically rich vs. neutral datasets does not lead to different shifts in scores. We also generalize these findings to a similar popular test called 8 Values. Humans do not change their responses to questions when prompted differently (``answer this question'' vs ``state your opinion''), or after exposure to politically neutral text, such as mathematical formulae. But the fact that the models do so raises concerns about the validity of these tests for measuring model bias, and paves the way for deeper exploration into how political and social views are encoded in LLMs.

<title>ConvMix: A Mixed-Criteria Data Augmentation Framework for Conversational Dense Retrieval</title>

arXiv:2508.04001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational search aims to satisfy users' complex information needs via multiple-turn interactions. The key challenge lies in revealing real users' search intent from the context-dependent queries. Previous studies achieve conversational search by fine-tuning a conversational dense retriever with relevance judgments between pairs of context-dependent queries and documents. However, this training paradigm encounters data scarcity issues. To this end, we propose ConvMix, a mixed-criteria framework to augment conversational dense retrieval, which covers more aspects than existing data augmentation frameworks. We design a two-sided relevance judgment augmentation schema in a scalable manner via the aid of large language models. Besides, we integrate the framework with quality control mechanisms to obtain semantically diverse samples and near-distribution supervisions to combine various annotated data. Experimental results on five widely used benchmarks show that the conversational dense retriever trained by our ConvMix framework outperforms previous baseline methods, which demonstrates our superior effectiveness.

arXiv:2509.09284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories-traditionally used for training value or reward models-can be repurposed to improve policy optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We reframe GRPO into a staged training paradigm, leveraging a teacher's MCTS rollouts to construct a tree-structured curriculum of prefixes. This introduces the novel challenge of computing advantages for training samples that originate from different prefixes, each with a distinct expected return. To address this, we propose Staged Advantage Estimation (SAE), a framework for computing low-variance, prefix-aware advantages by projecting rewards onto a constraint set that respects the tree's hierarchy. Our empirical results on mathematical reasoning tasks show that SAE improves final accuracy over standard GRPO. This outcome is grounded in our theoretical analysis, which confirms that SAE reduces gradient variance-a principled path to improved sample efficiency. We demonstrate this through practical SAE implementations, comparing efficient heuristics against a formal quadratic program.

<title>ReFineG: Synergizing Small Supervised Models and LLMs for Low-Resource Grounded Multimodal NER</title>

arXiv:2509.10975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) extends traditional NER by jointly detecting textual mentions and grounding them to visual regions. While existing supervised methods achieve strong performance, they rely on costly multimodal annotations and often underperform in low-resource domains. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong generalization but suffer from Domain Knowledge Conflict, producing redundant or incorrect mentions for domain-specific entities. To address these challenges, we propose ReFineG, a three-stage collaborative framework that integrates small supervised models with frozen MLLMs for low-resource GMNER. In the Training Stage, a domain-aware NER data synthesis strategy transfers LLM knowledge to small models with supervised training while avoiding domain knowledge conflicts. In the Refinement Stage, an uncertainty-based mechanism retains confident predictions from supervised models and delegates uncertain ones to the MLLM. In the Grounding Stage, a multimodal context selection algorithm enhances visual grounding through analogical reasoning. In the CCKS2025 GMNER Shared Task, ReFineG ranked second with an F1 score of 0.6461 on the online leaderboard, demonstrating its effectiveness with limited annotations.

<title>Token Hidden Reward: Steering Exploration-Exploitation in Group Relative Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet how to explicitly steer training toward exploration or exploitation remains an open problem. We introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly, tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks. By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama. These findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for dynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs, providing new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive applications.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative, reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance. TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of users.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems.

Abstract: Scientific idea generation lies at the heart of scientific discovery and has driven human progress-whether by solving unsolved problems or proposing novel hypotheses to explain unknown phenomena. Unlike standard scientific reasoning or general creative generation, idea generation in science is a multi-objective and open-ended task, where the novelty of a contribution is as essential as its empirical soundness. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising generators of scientific ideas, capable of producing coherent and factual outputs with surprising intuition and acceptable reasoning, yet their creative capacity remains inconsistent and poorly understood. This survey provides a structured synthesis of methods for LLM-driven scientific ideation, examining how different approaches balance creativity with scientific soundness. We categorize existing methods into five complementary families: External knowledge augmentation, Prompt-based distributional steering, Inference-time scaling, Multi-agent collaboration, and Parameter-level adaptation. To interpret their contributions, we employ two complementary frameworks: Boden's taxonomy of Combinatorial, Exploratory and Transformational creativity to characterize the level of ideas each family expected to generate, and Rhodes' 4Ps framework-Person, Process, Press, and Product-to locate the aspect or source of creativity that each method emphasizes. By aligning methodological advances with creativity frameworks, this survey clarifies the state of the field and outlines key directions toward reliable, systematic, and transformative applications of LLMs in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling sequential textual data and generalizing across diverse tasks. However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

Summary: 
The article introduces REFLEX, a reference-free evaluation metric for log summarization using large language models (LLMs). Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU rely on surface-level lexical overlap, making evaluating log summarization systems challenging due to the lack of high-quality reference summaries. REFLEX leverages LLMs as zero-shot evaluators to assess summary quality in terms of relevance, informativeness, and coherence without the need for gold-standard references or human annotations. The new metric produces stable, interpretable, and fine-grained evaluations across various log summarization datasets, effectively distinguishing model outputs better than traditional metrics. REFLEX offers a scalable alternative for evaluating log summaries in real-world scenarios where reference data may be scarce or unavailable. <br /><br /> <div>

We introduce REFLEX, a reference-free evaluation metric for log summarization based on large language model (LLM) judgment. REFLEX uses LLMs as zero-shot evaluators to assess summary quality along dimensions such as relevance, informativeness, and coherence, without requiring gold-standard references or human annotations. We show that REFLEX produces stable, interpretable, and fine-grained evaluations across multiple log summarization dataset, and more effectively distinguishes model outputs than traditional metrics. REFLEX provides a scalable alternative for evaluating log summaries in real-world settings where reference data is scarce or unavailable.

Summary:
DuTerm is a two-stage architecture for terminology-constrained machine translation that combines a terminology-aware NMT model with a prompt-based LLM for post-editing. The system was evaluated on multiple language pairs using the WMT 2025 Terminology Shared Task corpus. Results showed that the LLM stage, which refines NMT output and enforces terminology adherence, consistently produced higher quality translations compared to strict constraint enforcement. The study also highlighted the importance of flexible, context-driven terminology handling by the LLM, which was found to work best as context-driven mutators rather than generators. This trade-off between strict constraints and context-driven refinement is critical for achieving high-quality translations in terminology-constrained settings. <div>

Abstract: We introduce Motif-2-12.7B, a new open-weight foundation model that pushes the efficiency frontier of large language models by combining architectural innovation with system-level optimization. Designed for scalable language understanding and robust instruction generalization under constrained compute budgets, Motif-2-12.7B builds upon Motif-2.6B with the integration of Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), which improves representational efficiency by disentangling signal and noise-control attention pathways. The model is pre-trained on 5.5 trillion tokens spanning diverse linguistic, mathematical, scientific, and programming domains using a curriculum-driven data scheduler that gradually changes the data composition ratio. The training system leverages the MuonClip optimizer alongside custom high-performance kernels, including fused PolyNorm activations and the Parallel Muon algorithm, yielding significant throughput and memory efficiency gains in large-scale distributed environments. Post-training employs a three-stage supervised fine-tuning pipeline that successively enhances general instruction adherence, compositional understanding, and linguistic precision. Motif-2-12.7B demonstrates competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, showing that thoughtful architectural scaling and optimized training design can rival the capabilities of much larger models.

<div> method, attention heads, multilingual processing, language-specific, interpretability
Summary:
The article discusses the role of multi-head self-attention (MHA) in supporting multilingual processing in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS) as a method to identify attention head importance for multilingual capabilities in LLMs. They apply LAHIS to three LLMs and discover the presence of language-specific and language-general heads, with language-specific heads aiding in cross-lingual attention transfer. A lightweight adaptation is introduced to improve XQuAD accuracy by modulating attention outputs over language heads with minimal parameters. This study enhances the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs by highlighting the importance of MHA in addressing challenges related to multilingual understanding and generation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support multilingual understanding and generation. Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy. Overall, our work enhances both the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of MHA.

Summary: 
Pairwise reranking of documents in information retrieval systems to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) processes is crucial. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a significant role in this reranking, with Pairwise Reranking Prompting (PRP) being a popular method. However, concerns about complexity and computational demands exist. This study focuses on optimizing pairwise reranking, achieving a remarkable latency reduction while maintaining performance levels. By using smaller models, limiting the reranked set, and implementing other optimizations such as reducing positional bias and restricting output tokens, the efficiency of LLM-based reranking is significantly improved. These optimizations make LLM-based reranking more feasible for real-world deployment in latency-sensitive applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently reranking documents retrieved from information retrieval (IR) pipelines to enhance overall quality of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system remains an important yet challenging problem. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking tasks. In particular, Pairwise Reranking Prompting (PRP) has emerged as a promising plug-and-play approach due to its usability and effectiveness. However, the inherent complexity of the algorithm, coupled with the high computational demands and latency incurred due to LLMs, raises concerns about its feasibility in real-time applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a focused study on pairwise reranking, demonstrating that carefully applied optimization methods can significantly mitigate these issues. By implementing these methods, we achieve a remarkable latency reduction of up to 166 times, from 61.36 seconds to 0.37 seconds per query, with an insignificant drop in performance measured by Recall@k. Our study highlights the importance of design choices that were previously overlooked, such as using smaller models, limiting the reranked set, using lower precision, reducing positional bias with one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens. These optimizations make LLM-based reranking substantially more efficient and feasible for latency-sensitive, real-world deployments.

<div> Keywords: emotional nuances, Dutch-specific LLMs, valence prediction, sentiment analysis, low-resource language variant

Summary:
Traditional lexicon-based tools like LIWC and Pattern have been foundational in understanding emotional nuances in everyday language. However, this study evaluated the performance of Dutch-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) against these traditional methods for valence prediction in Flemish, a low-resource language variant. Surprisingly, the Dutch-tuned LLMs did not outperform Pattern, suggesting a challenge in capturing emotional valence in spontaneous narratives. The findings question assumptions about LLM superiority in sentiment analysis tasks and emphasize the need for culturally and linguistically tailored evaluation frameworks for low-resource language variants. This study highlights the complexity of emotional expression in real-world language use and raises concerns about the adequacy of current LLM fine-tuning approaches. <div>

Abstract: Understanding emotional nuances in everyday language is crucial for computational linguistics and emotion research. While traditional lexicon-based tools like LIWC and Pattern have served as foundational instruments, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise enhanced context understanding. We evaluated three Dutch-specific LLMs (ChocoLlama-8B-Instruct, Reynaerde-7B-chat, and GEITje-7B-ultra) against LIWC and Pattern for valence prediction in Flemish, a low-resource language variant. Our dataset comprised approximately 25000 spontaneous textual responses from 102 Dutch-speaking participants, each providing narratives about their current experiences with self-assessed valence ratings (-50 to +50). Surprisingly, despite architectural advancements, the Dutch-tuned LLMs underperformed compared to traditional methods, with Pattern showing superior performance. These findings challenge assumptions about LLM superiority in sentiment analysis tasks and highlight the complexity of capturing emotional valence in spontaneous, real-world narratives. Our results underscore the need for developing culturally and linguistically tailored evaluation frameworks for low-resource language variants, while questioning whether current LLM fine-tuning approaches adequately address the nuanced emotional expressions found in everyday language use.

Summary: 
- Evaluating answers from large language models is challenging due to semantic nuances that are missed by lexical metrics and the computational expense of LLM-as-Judge scoring.
- A lightweight alternative using off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference scoring augmented by a simple lexical-match flag matches GPT-4o's accuracy on long-form QA with significantly fewer parameters.
- The authors introduce DIVER-QA, a new 3000-sample human-annotated benchmark that spans five QA datasets and five candidate LLMs to test human alignment of evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Evaluating answers from state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) is challenging: lexical metrics miss semantic nuances, whereas "LLM-as-Judge" scoring is computationally expensive. We re-evaluate a lightweight alternative -- off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) scoring augmented by a simple lexical-match flag and find that this decades-old technique matches GPT-4o's accuracy (89.9%) on long-form QA, while requiring orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters. To test human alignment of these metrics rigorously, we introduce DIVER-QA, a new 3000-sample human-annotated benchmark spanning five QA datasets and five candidate LLMs. Our results highlight that inexpensive NLI-based evaluation remains competitive and offer DIVER-QA as an open resource for future metric research.

<br />
Summary: 
The study evaluates the reliability of six factuality metrics for abstractive text summarization on long documents. Perturbations like paraphrasing and simplification were used to test metric robustness. Short-form metrics showed inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and struggled with information-dense claims similar to the source document. Expanding the retrieval context improved stability in some domains but no metric consistently maintained factual alignment. The study suggests directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning and context-aware calibration. The results underline the need for training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization.<br /> 
 <div>

Abstract: Evaluating the factual consistency of abstractive text summarization remains a significant challenge, particularly for long documents, where conventional metrics struggle with input length limitations and long-range dependencies. In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization. We release all code, perturbed data, and scripts required to reproduce our results at https://github.com/zainmujahid/metricEval-longSum.

<div> Keywords: Preference optimization, Language models, Multilingual settings, Confidence-Aware, Robustness 

Summary: 
Preference optimization is a crucial technique for aligning large language models with human preferences post-training. Existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) may struggle to generalize effectively in multilingual settings. To address this, Confidence-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO) offers a dynamic loss scaling approach based on relative reward, enhancing robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons. Empirical results show CAPO surpassing existing baselines by 16% in reward accuracy and improving alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses across different languages. This innovation highlights the importance of incorporating confidence levels in preference pairs to enhance the performance and generalizability of preference optimization techniques in multilingual contexts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference optimization is a critical post-training technique used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, typically by fine-tuning on ranked response pairs. While methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have proven effective in English, they often fail to generalize robustly to multilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective alternative, Confidence-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which replaces DPO's fixed treatment of preference pairs with a dynamic loss scaling mechanism based on a relative reward. By modulating the learning signal according to the confidence in each preference pair, CAPO enhances robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons, typically encountered in multilingual text. Empirically, CAPO outperforms existing preference optimization baselines by at least 16% in reward accuracy, and improves alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses across languages.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article discusses the concept of critical confabulation, inspired by critical fabulation, where LLMs are used to fill in gaps in historical archives due to social inequalities. By simulating gaps in character-centric timelines, LLMs can generate masked events to reconstruct narratives of "hidden figures" in history. Audited LLM models demonstrated the capability to perform critical confabulation effectively, with controlled and well-specified hallucinations supporting knowledge production without compromising historical accuracy. The study evaluated the performance of different LLM models and baselines in generating useful hallucinations under various prompts, showcasing the potential for LLMs to contribute to historical narrative reconstruction. <div>
arXiv:2511.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs hallucinate, yet some confabulations can have social affordances if carefully bounded. We propose critical confabulation (inspired by critical fabulation from literary and social theory), the use of LLM hallucinations to "fill-in-the-gap" for omissions in archives due to social and political inequality, and reconstruct divergent yet evidence-bound narratives for history's "hidden figures". We simulate these gaps with an open-ended narrative cloze task: asking LLMs to generate a masked event in a character-centric timeline sourced from a novel corpus of unpublished texts. We evaluate audited (for data contamination), fully-open models (the OLMo-2 family) and unaudited open-weight and proprietary baselines under a range of prompts designed to elicit controlled and useful hallucinations. Our findings validate LLMs' foundational narrative understanding capabilities to perform critical confabulation, and show how controlled and well-specified hallucinations can support LLM applications for knowledge production without collapsing speculation into a lack of historical accuracy and fidelity.

Summary: 
The study examines how contextual predictability influences word choice and form in online language production. It explores the effects of backward predictability, which considers a word's predictability given its future context, in addition to its predictability based on past context. By analyzing naturalistic speech corpora, the study introduces a new information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates both past and future context. Results show that backward predictability impacts word duration and substitution errors. These errors provide insights into how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning. Overall, the findings highlight the significance of past and future context in word encoding and selection, shedding light on the mechanisms of sentence planning in language production. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual predictability shapes both the form and choice of words in online language production. The effects of the predictability of a word given its previous context are generally well-understood in both production and comprehension, but studies of naturalistic production have also revealed a poorly-understood backward predictability effect of a word given its future context, which may be related to future planning. Here, in two studies of naturalistic speech corpora, we investigate backward predictability effects using improved measures and more powerful language models, introducing a new principled and conceptually motivated information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates predictability from both the future and the past context. Our first study revisits classic predictability effects on word duration. Our second study investigates substitution errors within a generative framework that independently models the effects of lexical, contextual, and communicative factors on word choice, while predicting the actual words that surface as speech errors. We find that our proposed conceptually-motivated alternative to backward predictability yields qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Through a fine-grained analysis of substitution errors, we further show that different kinds of errors are suggestive of how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning. Together, these findings illuminate the functional roles of past and future context in how speakers encode and choose words, offering a bridge between contextual predictability effects and the mechanisms of sentence planning.

The benchmark covers 5 core dimensions, 54 sub-indicators, and 14,430 questions in the insurance field. Evaluation results show shortcomings in general-purpose and domain-specific models in insurance scenarios. Common bottlenecks in large models include weak actuarial capabilities and compliance adaptation. CUFEInse fills the gap in professional evaluation benchmarks for insurance, serving as a reference for academia and industry. The paper also discusses future iterations focusing on domain adaptation and reasoning enhancement for insurance large models. <div>
arXiv:2511.07794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper comprehensively elaborates on the construction methodology, multi-dimensional evaluation system, and underlying design philosophy of CUFEInse v1.0. Adhering to the principles of "quantitative-oriented, expert-driven, and multi-validation," the benchmark establishes an evaluation framework covering 5 core dimensions, 54 sub-indicators, and 14,430 high-quality questions, encompassing insurance theoretical knowledge, industry understanding, safety and compliance, intelligent agent application, and logical rigor. Based on this benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted on 11 mainstream large language models. The evaluation results reveal that general-purpose models suffer from common bottlenecks such as weak actuarial capabilities and inadequate compliance adaptation. High-quality domain-specific training demonstrates significant advantages in insurance vertical scenarios but exhibits shortcomings in business adaptation and compliance. The evaluation also accurately identifies the common bottlenecks of current large models in professional scenarios such as insurance actuarial, underwriting and claim settlement reasoning, and compliant marketing copywriting. The establishment of CUFEInse not only fills the gap in professional evaluation benchmarks for the insurance field, providing academia and industry with a professional, systematic, and authoritative evaluation tool, but also its construction concept and methodology offer important references for the evaluation paradigm of large models in vertical fields, serving as an authoritative reference for academic model optimization and industrial model selection. Finally, the paper looks forward to the future iteration direction of the evaluation benchmark and the core development direction of "domain adaptation + reasoning enhancement" for insurance large models.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel agent-centric, trainable, multi-layered graph memory framework to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework utilizes context memory to guide decision-making and improves the utilization of parametric information. A reinforcement-based weight optimization procedure is proposed to make the memory adaptable, estimating the utility of strategic meta-cognition based on reward feedback from downstream tasks. The optimized strategies are integrated into the LLM agent's training loop through meta-cognitive prompting. Empirically, the learnable graph memory demonstrates robust generalization, enhances strategic reasoning performance, and consistently benefits during Reinforcement Learning training. Overall, the framework improves LLM agents' ability to utilize prior experiences, leading to better decision-making in complex, open-ended environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in autonomous task-solving across complex, open-ended environments. A promising approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents is to better utilize prior experiences in guiding current decisions. However, LLMs acquire experience either through implicit memory via training, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited interpretability, or explicit memory via prompting, which lacks adaptability. In this paper, we introduce a novel agent-centric, trainable, multi-layered graph memory framework and evaluate how context memory enhances the ability of LLMs to utilize parametric information. The graph abstracts raw agent trajectories into structured decision paths in a state machine and further distills them into high-level, human-interpretable strategic meta-cognition. In order to make memory adaptable, we propose a reinforcement-based weight optimization procedure that estimates the empirical utility of each meta-cognition based on reward feedback from downstream tasks. These optimized strategies are then dynamically integrated into the LLM agent's training loop through meta-cognitive prompting. Empirically, the learnable graph memory delivers robust generalization, improves LLM agents' strategic reasoning performance, and provides consistent benefits during Reinforcement Learning (RL) training.

The benchmark provides task-specific evaluation metrics to assess fidelity, consistency, and fairness at individual and group levels, focusing on demographic diversity. To support AlignSurvey, a multi-tiered dataset architecture is constructed, including the Social Foundation Corpus and Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets.

Abstract: Understanding human attitudes, preferences, and behaviors through social surveys is essential for academic research and policymaking. Yet traditional surveys face persistent challenges, including fixed-question formats, high costs, limited adaptability, and difficulties ensuring cross-cultural equivalence. While recent studies explore large language models (LLMs) to simulate survey responses, most are limited to structured questions, overlook the entire survey process, and risks under-representing marginalized groups due to training data biases. We introduce AlignSurvey, the first benchmark that systematically replicates and evaluates the full social survey pipeline using LLMs. It defines four tasks aligned with key survey stages: social role modeling, semi-structured interview modeling, attitude stance modeling and survey response modeling. It also provides task-specific evaluation metrics to assess alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness at both individual and group levels, with a focus on demographic diversity. To support AlignSurvey, we construct a multi-tiered dataset architecture: (i) the Social Foundation Corpus, a cross-national resource with 44K+ interview dialogues and 400K+ structured survey records; and (ii) a suite of Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets, including the expert-annotated AlignSurvey-Expert (ASE) and two nationally representative surveys for cross-cultural evaluation. We release the SurveyLM family, obtained through two-stage fine-tuning of open-source LLMs, and offer reference models for evaluating domain-specific alignment. All datasets, models, and tools are available at github and huggingface to support transparent and socially responsible research.

Summary:
<br /><br />Forecasting social unrest events in democracies like India is crucial for administrative officials to take necessary action. This paper presents a system that utilizes topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, along with Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify key entities like people, organizations, locations, and dates. Time normalization is applied to convert future date mentions into a standard format for better analysis. The model developed in this study is geographically independent and aims to identify key features for filtering civil unrest events effectively. The concept of Related Entities, which are crucial entities involved in the event, is introduced, and a method for extracting them is proposed, referred to as Related Entity Extraction. By analyzing announcements in news articles and extracting related entities, the system can accurately forecast planned social unrest events and enable timely intervention by authorities. <div>

Abstract: In democracies like India, people are free to express their views and demands. Sometimes this causes situations of civil unrest such as protests, rallies, and marches. These events may be disruptive in nature and are often held without prior permission from the competent authority. Forecasting these events helps administrative officials take necessary action. Usually, protests are announced well in advance to encourage large participation. Therefore, by analyzing such announcements in news articles, planned events can be forecasted beforehand. We developed such a system in this paper to forecast social unrest events using topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. Time normalization is applied to convert future date mentions into a standard format. In this paper, we have developed a geographically independent, generalized model to identify key features for filtering civil unrest events. There could be many mentions of entities, but only a few may actually be involved in the event. This paper calls such entities Related Entities and proposes a method to extract them, referred to as Related Entity Extraction.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new approach, Manifold-Correcting Causal Flow (MC^2F), to address the challenge of balancing model robustness against adversarial attacks and performance on clean data in text classification. MC^2F consists of two modules: Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) learns the distribution of clean data in the encoder embedding manifold, while the Geodesic Purification Solver corrects out-of-distribution embeddings by projecting adversarial points back onto the learned manifold.

Abstract: A persistent challenge in text classification (TC) is that enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks typically degrades performance on clean data. We argue that this challenge can be resolved by modeling the distribution of clean samples in the encoder embedding manifold. To this end, we propose the Manifold-Correcting Causal Flow (MC^2F), a two-module system that operates directly on sentence embeddings. A Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) learns the density of the clean data manifold. It identifies out-of-distribution embeddings, which are then corrected by a Geodesic Purification Solver. This solver projects adversarial points back onto the learned manifold via the shortest path, restoring a clean, semantically coherent representation. We conducted extensive evaluations on text classification (TC) across three datasets and multiple adversarial attacks. The results demonstrate that our method, MC^2F, not only establishes a new state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness but also fully preserves performance on clean data, even yielding modest gains in accuracy.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Logic Drift, Knowledge Graph Question Answering, Logits-to-Logic framework, logic consistency

Summary:
The article introduces the Logits-to-Logic framework to enhance the logic consistency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in structured knowledge reasoning tasks, addressing the challenge of Logic Drift. By targeting the logits output during generation, the framework incorporates modules for strengthening and filtering logits to correct logical defects in LLM outputs. This approach improves logic consistency significantly and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks. Unlike existing methods that rely on input-level guidance, the Logits-to-Logic framework focuses on correcting logical flaws in LLM outputs and can adapt to different tasks and knowledge graphs flexibly. This innovative framework represents a significant advancement in improving LLMs' performance in reasoning tasks involving structured knowledge. 

<br /><br />Summary: The Logits-to-Logic framework enhances logic consistency in LLMs by targeting logits output, correcting logical defects, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on KGQA benchmarks. It outperforms existing methods by focusing on correcting logical flaws in LLM outputs and adapting flexibly to different tasks and knowledge graphs. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve excellent performance in natural language reasoning tasks through pre-training on vast unstructured text, enabling them to understand the logic in natural language and generate logic-consistent responses. However, the representational differences between unstructured and structured knowledge make LLMs inherently struggle to maintain logic consistency, leading to \textit{Logic Drift} challenges in structured knowledge reasoning tasks such as Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Existing methods address this limitation by designing complex workflows embedded in prompts to guide LLM reasoning. Nevertheless, these approaches only provide input-level guidance and fail to fundamentally address the \textit{Logic Drift} in LLM outputs. Additionally, their inflexible reasoning workflows cannot adapt to different tasks and knowledge graphs. To enhance LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning, we specifically target the logits output from the autoregressive generation process. We propose the \textit{Logits-to-Logic} framework, which incorporates logits strengthening and logits filtering as core modules to correct logical defects in LLM outputs. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple KGQA benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: human speech production, theta-band synchrony, speech modes, neural mechanisms, language processing<br />
Summary:<br />
This study explores the differences in theta-band neural synchrony across various modes of speech production, including perceived, overt, whispered, and imagined speech. The analysis focuses on connectivity metrics and region-wise variations. Overt and whispered speech show broad and strong frontotemporal synchrony, reflecting motor-phonological coupling during articulation. Perceived speech exhibits dominant posterior and temporal synchrony, related to auditory perception and comprehension. Imagined speech displays internally coherent synchronization primarily in frontal and supplementary motor regions. This study highlights the distinct neural dynamics underlying different speech modes, with overt articulation engaging widespread cortical interactions, whispered speech showing intermediate engagement, and perception relying on temporoparietal networks. Overall, the findings contribute to a better understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in language perception and imagined speech.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human speech production encompasses multiple modes such as perceived, overt, whispered, and imagined, each reflecting distinct neural mechanisms. Among these, theta-band synchrony has been closely associated with language processing, attentional control, and inner speech. However, previous studies have largely focused on a single mode, such as overt speech, and have rarely conducted an integrated comparison of theta synchrony across different speech modes. In this study, we analyzed differences in theta-band neural synchrony across speech modes based on connectivity metrics, focusing on region-wise variations. The results revealed that overt and whispered speech exhibited broader and stronger frontotemporal synchrony, reflecting active motor-phonological coupling during overt articulation, whereas perceived speech showed dominant posterior and temporal synchrony patterns, consistent with auditory perception and comprehension processes. In contrast, imagined speech demonstrated a more spatially confined but internally coherent synchronization pattern, primarily involving frontal and supplementary motor regions. These findings indicate that the extent and spatial distribution of theta synchrony differ substantially across modes, with overt articulation engaging widespread cortical interactions, whispered speech showing intermediate engagement, and perception relying predominantly on temporoparietal networks. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the differences in theta-band neural synchrony across various speech modes, thereby uncovering both the shared and distinct neural dynamics underlying language perception and imagined speech.

<br />
Workforce transformation in diverse industries has led to an increased demand for specialized natural language processing capabilities. However, work-related tasks present challenges such as long-tailed distributions, extreme multi-label target spaces, and limited data availability. The WorkBench evaluation suite addresses these complexities by formulating six work-related tasks as ranking problems, enabling cross-task transfer and enhancing performance through Unified Work Embeddings (UWE). UWE leverages real-world data to create task-specific bipartite graphs and employs a many-to-many InfoNCE objective to generate task-agnostic embeddings. The model shows zero-shot ranking performance on unseen target spaces, enables low-latency inference, and outperforms generalist embedding models in terms of macro-averaged MAP and RP@10.

Abstract: Workforce transformation across diverse industries has driven an increased demand for specialized natural language processing capabilities. Nevertheless, tasks derived from work-related contexts inherently reflect real-world complexities, characterized by long-tailed distributions, extreme multi-label target spaces, and scarce data availability. The rise of generalist embedding models prompts the question of their performance in the work domain, especially as progress in the field has focused mainly on individual tasks. To this end, we introduce WorkBench, the first unified evaluation suite spanning six work-related tasks formulated explicitly as ranking problems, establishing a common ground for multi-task progress. Based on this benchmark, we find significant positive cross-task transfer, and use this insight to compose task-specific bipartite graphs from real-world data, synthetically enriched through grounding. This leads to Unified Work Embeddings (UWE), a task-agnostic bi-encoder that exploits our training-data structure with a many-to-many InfoNCE objective, and leverages token-level embeddings with task-agnostic soft late interaction. UWE demonstrates zero-shot ranking performance on unseen target spaces in the work domain, enables low-latency inference by caching the task target space embeddings, and shows significant gains in macro-averaged MAP and RP@10 over generalist embedding models.

Summary:<br />
Accurate interpretation of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) is crucial for aviation safety. Existing automated systems struggle to extract actionable intelligence from the condensed and cryptic language of NOTAMs. This article proposes a self-evolving framework called NOTAM-Evolve that uses a large language model to master complex NOTAM interpretation. By leveraging knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval and a closed-loop learning process, the framework achieves a significant accuracy improvement. The researchers also introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Experimental results show a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base large language model, establishing a new state of the art in structured NOTAM interpretation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) is critical for aviation safety, yet their condensed and cryptic language poses significant challenges to both manual and automated processing. Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation.

<div> BERT-like models, LLMs, text classification, South Slavic languages, zero-shot performance<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to increased focus on zero-shot and few-shot prompting in text classification tasks. Evaluating the performance of language models across various South Slavic languages, this study compared fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of LLMs in sentiment, topic, and genre classification tasks. Results indicate that LLMs exhibit strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing BERT-like models, both in English and South Slavic languages. However, drawbacks of LLMs include less predictable outputs, slower inference, and higher computational costs. Despite the promising performance of LLMs, the practical choice for large-scale text annotation still leans towards fine-tuned BERT-like models. <div>
arXiv:2511.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until recently, fine-tuned BERT-like models provided state-of-the-art performance on text classification tasks. With the rise of instruction-tuned decoder-only models, commonly known as large language models (LLMs), the field has increasingly moved toward zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English. However, we also point out key drawbacks of LLMs, including less predictable outputs, significantly slower inference, and higher computational costs. Due to these limitations, fine-tuned BERT-like models remain a more practical choice for large-scale automatic text annotation.

Summary:
Structured data question answering (QA) is a key research area, with recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) driving progress. However, small-scale LLMs face challenges in generating accurate structured queries. To address this, a self-correction distillation (SCD) method is proposed. SCD includes an error prompt mechanism (EPM) to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, along with a two-stage distillation strategy to transfer capabilities from large-scale LLMs to small-scale ones. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that SCD outperforms other distillation methods on small-scale LLMs and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets. Large-scale LLMs with EPM also achieve state-of-the-art results on most datasets.

Abstract: Structured data question answering (QA), including table QA, Knowledge Graph (KG) QA, and temporal KG QA, is a pivotal research area. Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA. However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to small-scale LLMs since small-scale LLMs are prone to errors in generating structured queries. To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets. Furthermore, large-scale LLMs equipped with EPM surpass the state-of-the-art results on most datasets.

Summary:
HyCoRA is a novel Hyper-Contrastive Role-Adaptive (HyCoRA) framework designed to enhance multi-character role-playing by effectively balancing the learning of distinct and shared traits. The framework consists of a Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation structure, featuring a role-specific module generated by a lightweight hyper-network and a trainable role-shared module. The role-specific module captures unique persona signatures, while the role-shared module focuses on common traits. Additionally, a hyper-contrastive learning mechanism is used to differentiate between distinct personalities across roles. Experimental results on English and Chinese benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of HyCoRA. Evaluation using GPT-4 and visual analyses further confirm the framework's ability to represent role characteristics effectively. <div>
arXiv:2511.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-character role-playing aims to equip models with the capability to simulate diverse roles. Existing methods either use one shared parameterized module across all roles or assign a separate parameterized module to each role. However, the role-shared module may ignore distinct traits of each role, weakening personality learning, while the role-specific module may overlook shared traits across multiple roles, hindering commonality modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel HyCoRA: Hyper-Contrastive Role-Adaptive learning framework, which efficiently improves multi-character role-playing ability by balancing the learning of distinct and shared traits. Specifically, we propose a Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation structure, where one half is a role-specific module generated by a lightweight hyper-network, and the other half is a trainable role-shared module. The role-specific module is devised to represent distinct persona signatures, while the role-shared module serves to capture common traits. Moreover, to better reflect distinct personalities across different roles, we design a hyper-contrastive learning mechanism to help the hyper-network distinguish their unique characteristics. Extensive experimental results on both English and Chinese available benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Further GPT-4 evaluations and visual analyses also verify the capability of HyCoRA to capture role characteristics.

Summary:
- The research investigates Bangla authorship attribution using a new balanced benchmark corpus BARD10 and analyzes the impact of stop-word removal on classical and deep learning models.
- BARD10, containing Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten authors, is evaluated alongside the BAAD16 corpus using classifiers like SVM, Bangla BERT, XGBoost, and MLP.
- The classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed deep learning models on both datasets, suggesting the importance of finely calibrated ML models for short texts.
- Authors in BARD10 are more influenced by stop-word pruning compared to BAAD16, indicating genre-dependent reliance on stop-word signatures.
- Error analysis revealed that transformer models may diminish or reduce high-frequency components transmitting authorial signatures. The study provides insights on the significance of Bangla stop-words, the effectiveness of ML models in short-text scenarios, and the potential of BARD10 as a benchmark for future transformer models.


Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a comprehensive investigation into Bangla authorship attribution, introducing a new balanced benchmark corpus BARD10 (Bangla Authorship Recognition Dataset of 10 authors) and systematically analyzing the impact of stop-word removal across classical and deep learning models to uncover the stylistic significance of Bangla stop-words. BARD10 is a curated corpus of Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten contemporary authors, alongside the methodical assessment of four representative classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Bangla BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), XGBoost, and a MLP (Multilayer Perception), utilizing uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and the benchmark corpora BAAD16 (Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors). In all datasets, the classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed, attaining a macro-F1 score of 0.997 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10, while Bangla BERT lagged by as much as five points. This study reveals that BARD10 authors are highly sensitive to stop-word pruning, while BAAD16 authors remain comparatively robust highlighting genre-dependent reliance on stop-word signatures. Error analysis revealed that high frequency components transmit authorial signatures that are diminished or reduced by transformer models. Three insights are identified: Bangla stop-words serve as essential stylistic indicators; finely calibrated ML models prove effective within short-text limitations; and BARD10 connects formal literature with contemporary web dialogue, offering a reproducible benchmark for future long-context or domain-adapted transformers.

<div> Keywords: science fiction, conceptual permeability, masked language modeling, ontological categories, genre-specific restructuring

Summary:
This paper explores how science fiction challenges traditional ontological boundaries between humans, animals, and machines using computational analysis. By applying masked language modeling to science fiction and general fiction corpora, the study measures the deviation in token predictions to quantify conceptual slippage. The findings show that science fiction exhibits higher conceptual permeability, especially around machine references, leading to significant cross-category substitutions and dispersion. In contrast, human terms maintain semantic coherence, anchoring substitutional hierarchies. These patterns suggest a genre-specific restructuring within anthropocentric logics, where estrangement in science fiction serves as a controlled disruption of semantic norms. The study highlights the importance of using computational tools critically in literary analysis to uncover genre-conditioned ontological assumptions, contributing to a deeper understanding of the linguistic framework of science fiction. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how science fiction destabilises ontological categories by measuring conceptual permeability across the terms human, animal, and machine using masked language modelling (MLM). Drawing on corpora of science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM), we operationalise Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement as computationally measurable deviation in token prediction, using RoBERTa to generate lexical substitutes for masked referents and classifying them via Gemini. We quantify conceptual slippage through three metrics: retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy, mapping the stability or disruption of category boundaries across genres. Our findings reveal that science fiction exhibits heightened conceptual permeability, particularly around machine referents, which show significant cross-category substitution and dispersion. Human terms, by contrast, maintain semantic coherence and often anchor substitutional hierarchies. These patterns suggest a genre-specific restructuring within anthropocentric logics. We argue that estrangement in science fiction operates as a controlled perturbation of semantic norms, detectable through probabilistic modelling, and that MLMs, when used critically, serve as interpretive instruments capable of surfacing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions. This study contributes to the methodological repertoire of computational literary studies and offers new insights into the linguistic infrastructure of science fiction.

Summary:
This paper investigates the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to compose skills across modalities by designing evaluation tasks that require the composition of two modality-dependent skills. The study evaluates different MLLMs under two settings: direct task solving and cascaded inference. The results reveal a significant skill composition gap across modalities in all evaluated MLLMs. To address this gap, the study explores two strategies - chain-of-thought prompting and a specific fine-tuning recipe. While these strategies improve model performance, they still exhibit notable skill composition gaps, indicating the need for further research in enhancing cross-modal skill composition in MLLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skill composition is the ability to combine previously learned skills to solve new tasks. As neural networks acquire increasingly complex skills during their pretraining, it is not clear how successfully they can compose them. In this paper, we focus on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), and study their ability to compose skills across modalities. To this end, we design three evaluation tasks which can be solved sequentially composing two modality-dependent skills, and evaluate several open MLLMs under two main settings: i) prompting the model to directly solve the task, and ii) using a two-step cascaded inference approach, which manually enforces the composition of the two skills for a given task. Even with these straightforward compositions, we find that all evaluated MLLMs exhibit a significant cross-modality skill composition gap. To mitigate the aforementioned gap, we explore two alternatives: i) use chain-of-thought prompting to explicitly instruct MLLMs for skill composition and ii) a specific fine-tuning recipe to promote skill composition. Although those strategies improve model performance, they still exhibit significant skill composition gaps, suggesting that more research is needed to improve cross-modal skill composition in MLLMs.

<div> quantification, Large Language Models, cross-linguistic, ordering, scales <br />
Summary:<br />
This paper explores the challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding quantification, a complex linguistic phenomenon that interfaces with logic, pragmatics, and numerical domains. The study focuses on three key features of human quantification that have not been thoroughly investigated in LLM literature: the ordering of quantifiers into scales, the ranges of use and prototypicality, and biases in the human approximate number system. By comparing human and LLM performance across different tasks, the researchers highlight clear differences in the representation of quantification. The findings suggest that LLMs may not fully capture the nuances of human quantification, raising questions about their semantic and pragmatic capabilities. The study also emphasizes the importance of considering cross-linguistic variations in LLM performance to assess their robustness and stability across diverse languages.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantification has been proven to be a particularly difficult linguistic phenomenon for (Multimodal) Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, given that quantification interfaces with the logic, pragmatic, and numerical domains, the exact reasons for the poor performance are still unclear. This papers looks at three key features of human quantification shared cross-linguistically that have remained so far unexplored in the (M)LLM literature: the ordering of quantifiers into scales, the ranges of use and prototypicality, and the biases inherent in the human approximate number system. The aim is to determine how these features are encoded in the models' architecture, how they may differ from humans, and whether the results are affected by the type of model and language under investigation. We find that there are clear differences between humans and MLLMs with respect to these features across various tasks that tap into the representation of quantification in vivo vs. in silico. This work, thus, paves the way for addressing the nature of MLLMs as semantic and pragmatic agents, while the cross-linguistic lens can elucidate whether their abilities are robust and stable across different languages.

Summary:<br />
This work explores context compression for Large Language Models (LLMs) through the use of learned compression tokens to decrease memory and computational requirements for handling lengthy sequences. Pre-trained LLMs can be optimized to compress their context by ratios ranging from 2x to 8x with minimal impact on performance, evident in evaluations on short and long-context benchmarks. Additionally, experiments conducted on a 3-billion-parameter LLaMA model demonstrate that this approach achieves comparable results to other compression techniques while achieving higher compression ratios. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This work investigates context compression for Large Language Models (LLMs) using learned compression tokens to reduce the memory and computational demands of processing long sequences. We demonstrate that pre-trained LLMs can be fine-tuned to compress their context by factors of 2x to 8x without significant performance degradation, as evaluated on both short-context and long-context benchmarks. Furthermore, in experiments on a 3-billion-parameter LLaMA model, our method achieves results on par with alternative compression techniques while attaining higher compression ratios.

<div> Keywords: language models, positional encodings, morphological complexity, word order flexibility, downstream tasks

Summary: 
Language model architectures are often developed in English and then transferred to other languages. This study investigates the impact of this bias on languages that differ structurally from English. The focus is on positional encodings and the trade-off hypothesis, which suggests a relationship between morphological complexity and word order flexibility. Pretraining models with different positional encodings for seven diverse languages, the study examines their performance on various tasks. Contrary to expectations, the results do not show a clear connection between positional encodings and language characteristics. The study highlights the importance of considering tasks, languages, and metrics in drawing meaningful conclusions. The findings suggest that further research is needed to fully understand the implications of architectural choices in language modeling. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language model architectures are predominantly first created for English and subsequently applied to other languages. It is an open question whether this architectural bias leads to degraded performance for languages that are structurally different from English. We examine one specific architectural choice: positional encodings, through the lens of the trade-off hypothesis: the supposed interplay between morphological complexity and word order flexibility. This hypothesis posits a trade-off between the two: a more morphologically complex language can have a more flexible word order, and vice-versa. Positional encodings are a direct target to investigate the implications of this hypothesis in relation to language modelling. We pretrain monolingual model variants with absolute, relative, and no positional encodings for seven typologically diverse languages and evaluate them on four downstream tasks. Contrary to previous findings, we do not observe a clear interaction between position encodings and morphological complexity or word order flexibility, as measured by various proxies. Our results show that the choice of tasks, languages, and metrics are essential for drawing stable conclusions

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Document-level Relation Extraction, Relation as a Prior, binary relation, triples extraction

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great document understanding capabilities but struggle with Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) due to fine-grained comprehension challenges. The traditional approach of extracting entities before predicting relations introduces noise from unrelated entity pairs and struggles with predicting relations beyond predefined labels. To address these issues, a novel approach called Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) is proposed. RelPrior uses binary relations as a prior to filter out irrelevant entity pairs and predefined relations as a prior for triple extraction, avoiding misjudgments caused by strict predefined labels. Experimental results on two benchmarks show that RelPrior outperforms existing LLM-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities in document understanding. However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted "extract entities then predict relations" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that RelPrior achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLM-based methods.

Summary:<br />
The study compares Large Language Models (LLMs) with smaller task-specific models on the Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion task. The task involves complex reasoning due to the unique characteristics of Sanskrit verse. Through domain-specific fine-tuning, the ByT5-Sanskrit model outperforms LLM approaches. Human evaluation supports this finding. In-context learning templates based on Paninian grammar offer an alternative to fine-tuning when specific corpora are lacking. The task-specific Seq2Seq model shows robust generalization in out-of-domain evaluations.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.08145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly treated as universal, general-purpose solutions across NLP tasks, particularly in English. But does this assumption hold for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Sanskrit? We address this question by comparing instruction-tuned and in-context-prompted LLMs with smaller task-specific encoder-decoder models on the Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion task. This task is intrinsically challenging: Sanskrit verse exhibits free word order combined with rigid metrical constraints, and its conversion to canonical prose (anvaya) requires multi-step reasoning involving compound segmentation, dependency resolution, and syntactic linearisation. This makes it an ideal testbed to evaluate whether LLMs can surpass specialised models. For LLMs, we apply instruction fine-tuning on general-purpose models and design in-context learning templates grounded in Paninian grammar and classical commentary heuristics. For task-specific modelling, we fully fine-tune a ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq model. Our experiments show that domain-specific fine-tuning of ByT5-Sanskrit significantly outperforms all instruction-driven LLM approaches. Human evaluation strongly corroborates this result, with scores exhibiting high correlation with Kendall's Tau scores. Additionally, our prompting strategies provide an alternative to fine-tuning when domain-specific verse corpora are unavailable, and the task-specific Seq2Seq model demonstrates robust generalisation on out-of-domain evaluations.

Summary: 
The study investigates the syntactic properties of the BabyLM corpus and different age-groups within the CHILDES dataset. It is observed that CHILDES does not show significant syntactic variation based on age. However, the study demonstrates that understanding the syntactic structure of the training data can aid in interpreting model performance in linguistic tasks. The research delves into curriculum learning, exploring developmental and other cognitively inspired curriculum strategies. While some curricula show improvement in reading tasks, the most substantial performance enhancement is achieved by utilizing a subset of syntactically classifiable data rather than the entire noisy corpus. The findings suggest the importance of considering syntactic knowledge when designing curriculum approaches for language learning tasks. <div>

Abstract: We examine the syntactic properties of BabyLM corpus, and age-groups within CHILDES. While we find that CHILDES does not exhibit strong syntactic differentiation by age, we show that the syntactic knowledge about the training data can be helpful in interpreting model performance on linguistic tasks. For curriculum learning, we explore developmental and several alternative cognitively inspired curriculum approaches. We find that some curricula help with reading tasks, but the main performance improvement come from using the subset of syntactically categorizable data, rather than the full noisy corpus.

Summary: 
In this article, a benchmarking framework is proposed to detect bias in large language models (LLMs) used for educational purposes, particularly in providing formative feedback. The study utilized 600 student essays to analyze the response of six representative LLMs to gender substitutions in different contexts. The results indicated that there were asymmetric semantic responses to gender manipulations, with male-female substitutions inducing larger shifts than female-male. Only certain models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. Qualitative analysis revealed linguistic differences in feedback based on gender cues, such as more autonomy-supportive feedback under male prompts. The findings suggest persistent gender biases in the feedback provided by LLMs, highlighting the need for fairness auditing in pedagogical GenAI. The article proposes reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics and provides practical guidance for designing prompts to ensure equitable feedback.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As teachers increasingly turn to GenAI in their educational practice, we need robust methods to benchmark large language models (LLMs) for pedagogical purposes. This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback.

Abstract: The development of multi-modal large language models (LLMs) leads to intelligent approaches capable of speech interactions. As one of the most widely spoken languages globally, Mandarin is supported by most models to enhance their applicability and reach. However, the scarcity of comprehensive speech-to-speech (S2S) benchmarks in Mandarin contexts impedes systematic evaluation for developers and hinders fair model comparison for users. In this work, we propose VocalBench-zh, an ability-level divided evaluation suite adapted to Mandarin context consisting of 10 well-crafted subsets and over 10K high-quality instances, covering 12 user-oriented characters. The evaluation experiment on 14 mainstream models reveals the common challenges for current routes, and highlights the need for new insights into next-generation speech interactive systems.

A dataset of UK Parliament speeches was used to train models, and an evaluation framework was developed to assess linguistic quality, semantic coherence, and political authenticity. Two novel metrics, Political Spectrum Alignment and Party Alignment, were proposed to measure ideological positioning. Five language models were fine-tuned and evaluated, with results showing significant improvements in most metrics when compared to baseline models. The novel metrics demonstrated strong discriminative power in assessing political dimensions. <div>

Abstract: Parliamentary speech generation presents specific challenges for large language models beyond standard text generation tasks. Unlike general text generation, parliamentary speeches require not only linguistic quality but also political authenticity and ideological consistency. Current language models lack specialized training for parliamentary contexts, and existing evaluation methods focus on standard NLP metrics rather than political authenticity. To address this, we present ParliaBench, a benchmark for parliamentary speech generation. We constructed a dataset of speeches from UK Parliament to enable systematic model training. We introduce an evaluation framework combining computational metrics with LLM-as-a-judge assessments for measuring generation quality across three dimensions: linguistic quality, semantic coherence, and political authenticity. We propose two novel embedding-based metrics, Political Spectrum Alignment and Party Alignment, to quantify ideological positioning. We fine-tuned five large language models (LLMs), generated 28k speeches, and evaluated them using our framework, comparing baseline and fine-tuned models. Results show that fine-tuning produces statistically significant improvements across the majority of metrics and our novel metrics demonstrate strong discriminative power for political dimensions.

This work investigates the ability of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) to understand the hierarchical structure of tables in scientific articles. The study uses the PubTables-1M dataset to create a benchmark collection of Complex Hierarchical Tables (CHiTab). Various prompt engineering strategies are employed to assess the models' comprehension capabilities. State-of-the-art VLLMs are evaluated on the CHiTab benchmark dataset, both in their off-the-shelf versions and after fine-tuning on the task.

Abstract: This work investigates the ability of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) to understand and interpret the structure of tables in scientific articles. Specifically, we explore whether VLLMs can infer the hierarchical structure of tables without additional processing. As a basis for our experiments we use the PubTables-1M dataset, a large-scale corpus of scientific tables. From this dataset, we extract a subset of tables that we introduce as Complex Hierarchical Tables (CHiTab): a benchmark collection of complex tables containing hierarchical headings. We adopt a series of prompt engineering strategies to probe the models' comprehension capabilities, experimenting with various prompt formats and writing styles. Multiple state-of-the-art open-weights VLLMs are evaluated on the benchmark first using their off-the-shelf versions and then fine-tuning some models on our task. We also measure the performance of humans to solve the task on a small set of tables comparing with performance of the evaluated VLLMs. The experiments support our intuition that generic VLLMs, not explicitly designed for understanding the structure of tables, can perform this task. This study provides insights into the potential and limitations of VLLMs to process complex tables and offers guidance for future work on integrating structured data understanding into general-purpose VLLMs.

Summary:
ReViewGraph is introduced as a new framework to enhance paper review methods by incorporating heterogeneous graph reasoning over LLM-simulated reviewer-author debates. The framework simulates reviewer-author exchanges using LLM-based multi-agent collaboration and extracts diverse opinion relations as typed edges in a structured debate graph. By utilizing graph neural networks, ReViewGraph captures detailed argumentative dynamics, enabling more informed review decisions. Experimental results on three datasets show that ReViewGraph outperforms strong baselines by an average relative improvement of 15.73%. This highlights the importance of modeling intricate reviewer-author debate structures in improving the paper review process. <div>
arXiv:2511.08317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing paper review methods often rely on superficial manuscript features or directly on large language models (LLMs), which are prone to hallucinations, biased scoring, and limited reasoning capabilities. Moreover, these methods often fail to capture the complex argumentative reasoning and negotiation dynamics inherent in reviewer-author interactions. To address these limitations, we propose ReViewGraph (Reviewer-Author Debates Graph Reasoner), a novel framework that performs heterogeneous graph reasoning over LLM-simulated multi-round reviewer-author debates. In our approach, reviewer-author exchanges are simulated through LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Diverse opinion relations (e.g., acceptance, rejection, clarification, and compromise) are then explicitly extracted and encoded as typed edges within a heterogeneous interaction graph. By applying graph neural networks to reason over these structured debate graphs, ReViewGraph captures fine-grained argumentative dynamics and enables more informed review decisions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ReViewGraph outperforms strong baselines with an average relative improvement of 15.73%, underscoring the value of modeling detailed reviewer-author debate structures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in conversational systems by generating human-like responses. However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query. We validate our framework on challenging conversational datasets, demonstrating that ours significantly outperforms relevant baselines, particularly in tasks involving knowledge or user's persona, or both.

<div> reinforcement learning, large language models, decision-making tasks, process reward models, Generalized Advantage Estimation

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach for improving decision-making in large language models (LLMs) in agent tasks. It proposes the use of process reward models (PRMs) called AgentPRM to evaluate decisions based on progress towards the goal rather than correctness. This new approach aims to better capture the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal, leading to improved progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To train AgentPRM efficiently, a Temporal Difference-based estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) is employed. Experimental results show that AgentPRM is significantly more compute-efficient than baselines, with over 8 times improvement. The method also demonstrates robust performance when scaling up test-time compute. The study includes detailed analyses and insights on applying AgentPRM to reinforcement learning of LLM agents. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid development, large language models (LLMs) still encounter challenges in multi-turn decision-making tasks (i.e., agent tasks) like web shopping and browser navigation, which require making a sequence of intelligent decisions based on environmental feedback. Previous work for LLM agents typically relies on elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning with expert trajectories to improve performance. In this work, we take a different perspective: we explore constructing process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate each decision and guide the agent's decision-making process. Unlike LLM reasoning, where each step is scored based on correctness, actions in agent tasks do not have a clear-cut correctness. Instead, they should be evaluated based on their proximity to the goal and the progress they have made. Building on this insight, we propose a re-defined PRM for agent tasks, named AgentPRM, to capture both the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal. This enables better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To scalably obtain labeled data for training AgentPRM, we employ a Temporal Difference-based (TD-based) estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which proves more sample-efficient than prior methods. Extensive experiments across different agentic tasks show that AgentPRM is over $8\times$ more compute-efficient than baselines, and it demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute. Moreover, we perform detailed analyses to show how our method works and offer more insights, e.g., applying AgentPRM to the reinforcement learning of LLM agents.

<div> Keywords: multi-hop question answering, Chain of Thought, Knowledge Graphs, Outcome Reward Models, Implicit Process Reward Model

Summary:
In this article, the authors introduce a novel approach called Dual Implicit Process Reward Model (DPRM) to enhance multi-hop question answering tasks. The DPRM consists of two implicit Process Reward Models (PRMs) - KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, which derive step-level rewards without explicit annotations. KG-PRM utilizes preference pairs to learn structural constraints from Knowledge Graphs (KGs), while CoT-PRM focuses on multi-step reasoning guided by Chain of Thought. The DPRM integrates a consistency constraint to ensure coherence between CoT and KG reasoning paths. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the derivation of process rewards in the model. Experimental results exhibit a significant performance improvement compared to 13 baseline methods, with up to a 16.6% increase in Hit@1 metric on multiple datasets. <div>

Abstract: In multi-hop question answering (MHQA) tasks, Chain of Thought (CoT) improves the quality of generation by guiding large language models (LLMs) through multi-step reasoning, and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) reduce hallucinations via semantic matching. Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards. Experimental results show that our method outperforms 13 baselines on multiple datasets with up to 16.6% improvement on Hit@1.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the dynamic articulatory model DYNARTmo, which simulates speech production through continuous articulator movements based on speech gestures and a corresponding gesture score. The model is designed to mimic the hierarchical control of speech production in a neurobiologically inspired computational framework. The structure of the gesture inventory and the coordination of gestures within the gesture score are outlined, demonstrating how they translate into continuous articulator trajectories that control the DYNARTmo vocal tract model. This implementation provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and modeling speech production, bridging the gap between linguistic representation and articulatory-acoustic realization. <div>

Summary:
Proof-Carrying Reasoning with Large Language Models (PCRLLM) is a framework proposed to improve the logical coherence of LLMs by constraining reasoning to single-step inferences. This approach ensures that each output explicitly specifies premises, rules, and conclusions, allowing for verification against a target logic and addressing trustworthiness concerns in black-box settings. PCRLLM also enables systematic multi-LLM collaboration, facilitating the comparison and integration of intermediate reasoning steps under formal rules. Additionally, a benchmark schema for generating large-scale step-level reasoning data is introduced, combining natural language expressiveness with formal rigor. Through these mechanisms, PCRLLM aims to enhance the reliability and transparency of reasoning processes in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit limited logical coherence, mapping premises to conclusions without adherence to explicit inference rules. We propose Proof-Carrying Reasoning with LLMs (PCRLLM), a framework that constrains reasoning to single-step inferences while preserving natural language formulations. Each output explicitly specifies premises, rules, and conclusions, thereby enabling verification against a target logic. This mechanism mitigates trustworthiness concerns by supporting chain-level validation even in black-box settings. Moreover, PCRLLM facilitates systematic multi-LLM collaboration, allowing intermediate steps to be compared and integrated under formal rules. Finally, we introduce a benchmark schema for generating large-scale step-level reasoning data, combining natural language expressiveness with formal rigor.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversations typically relies on reward signals derived from the content of the text. This approach, however, overlooks a rich, complementary source of signal: the dynamics of the interaction itself. This paper introduces TRACE (Trajectory-based Reward for Agent Collaboration Estimation), a novel reward signal derived from the geometric properties of a dialogue's embedding trajectory--a concept we term 'conversational geometry'. Our central finding is that a reward model trained only on these structural signals achieves a pairwise accuracy (68.20%) comparable to a powerful LLM baseline that analyzes the full transcript (70.04%). Furthermore, a hybrid model combining interaction dynamics with textual analysis achieves the highest performance (80.17%), demonstrating their complementary nature. This work provides strong evidence that for interactive settings, how an agent communicates is as powerful a predictor of success as what it says, offering a new, privacy-preserving framework that not only aligns agents but also serves as a diagnostic tool for understanding the distinct interaction patterns that drive successful collaboration.

<title>Bot Meets Shortcut: How Can LLMs Aid in Handling Unknown Invariance OOD Scenarios?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While existing social bot detectors perform well on benchmarks, their robustness across diverse real-world scenarios remains limited due to unclear ground truth and varied misleading cues. In particular, the impact of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations instead of capturing causal task-relevant features, has received limited attention. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to assess how detectors are influenced by potential shortcuts based on textual features, which are most susceptible to manipulation by social bots. We design a series of shortcut scenarios by constructing spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues to evaluate model robustness. Results show that shifts in irrelevant feature distributions significantly degrade social bot detector performance, with an average relative accuracy drop of 32\% in the baseline models. To tackle this challenge, we propose mitigation strategies based on large language models, leveraging counterfactual data augmentation. These methods mitigate the problem from data and model perspectives across three levels, including data distribution at both the individual user text and overall dataset levels, as well as the model's ability to extract causal information. Our strategies achieve an average relative performance improvement of 56\% under shortcut scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) adapted to financial domains often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of general reasoning capabilities essential for customer interactions and complex financial analysis. We introduce Selective Parameter Evaluation and Restoration via Model Merging (SPEAR-MM), a practical framework that preserves critical capabilities while enabling domain adaptation. Our method approximates layer-wise impact on external benchmarks through post-hoc analysis, then selectively freezes or restores transformer layers via spherical interpolation merging. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B for financial tasks, SPEAR-MM achieves 91.2% retention of general capabilities versus 69.7% for standard continual pretraining, while maintaining 94% of domain adaptation gains. The approach provides interpretable trade-off control and reduces computational costs by 90% crucial for resource-constrained financial institutions.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the dominant approach for answering questions over large corpora. However, current datasets and methods are highly focused on cases where only a small part of the corpus (usually a few paragraphs) is relevant per query, and fail to capture the rich world of aggregative queries. These require gathering information from a large set of documents and reasoning over them. To address this gap, we propose S-RAG, an approach specifically designed for such queries. At ingestion time, S-RAG constructs a structured representation of the corpus; at inference time, it translates natural-language queries into formal queries over said representation. To validate our approach and promote further research in this area, we introduce two new datasets of aggregative queries: HOTELS and WORLD CUP. Experiments with S-RAG on the newly introduced datasets, as well as on a public benchmark, demonstrate that it substantially outperforms both common RAG systems and long-context LLMs.

Abstract: Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) translation represents a low-resource NLP task due to the lack of large-scale datasets that address sentence-level translation. Correspondingly, existing research in this field has been limited to word and alphabet level detection. In this work, we introduce Bangla-SGP, a novel parallel dataset consisting of 1,000 human-annotated sentence-gloss pairs which was augmented with around 3,000 synthetically generated pairs using syntactic and morphological rules through a rule-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The gloss sequences of the spoken Bangla sentences are made up of individual glosses which are Bangla sign supported words and serve as an intermediate representation for a continuous sign. Our dataset consists of 1000 high quality Bangla sentences that are manually annotated into a gloss sequence by a professional signer. The augmentation process incorporates rule-based linguistic strategies and prompt engineering techniques that we have adopted by critically analyzing our human annotated sentence-gloss pairs and by working closely with our professional signer. Furthermore, we fine-tune several transformer-based models such as mBart50, Google mT5, GPT4.1-nano and evaluate their sentence-to-gloss translation performance using BLEU scores, based on these evaluation metrics we compare the model's gloss-translation consistency across our dataset and the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models have made significant progress in complex but easy-to-verify problems, yet they still struggle with discovering the unknown. In this paper, we present \textbf{AlphaResearch}, an autonomous research agent designed to discover new algorithms on open-ended problems. To synergize the feasibility and innovation of the discovery process, we construct a novel dual research environment by combining the execution-based verify and simulated real-world peer review environment. AlphaResearch discovers new algorithm by iteratively running the following steps: (1) propose new ideas (2) verify the ideas in the dual research environment (3) optimize the research proposals for better performance. To promote a transparent evaluation process, we construct \textbf{AlphaResearchComp}, a new evaluation benchmark that includes an eight open-ended algorithmic problems competition, with each problem carefully curated and verified through executable pipelines, objective metrics, and reproducibility checks. AlphaResearch gets a 2/8 win rate in head-to-head comparison with human researchers, demonstrate the possibility of accelerating algorithm discovery with LLMs. Notably, the algorithm discovered by AlphaResearch on the \emph{``packing circles''} problem achieves the best-of-known performance, surpassing the results of human researchers and strong baselines from recent work (e.g., AlphaEvolve). Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the remaining challenges of the 6/8 failure cases, providing valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers. Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models' misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.

Abstract: This report presents a detailed methodology for constructing a high-quality Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) dataset from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the OntoNotes 5.0 corpus and adapting it for Opinion Role Labeling (ORL) tasks. Leveraging the PropBank annotation framework, we implement a reproducible extraction pipeline that aligns predicate-argument structures with surface text, converts syntactic tree pointers to coherent spans, and applies rigorous cleaning to ensure semantic fidelity. The resulting dataset comprises 97,169 predicate-argument instances with clearly defined Agent (ARG0), Predicate (REL), and Patient (ARG1) roles, mapped to ORL's Holder, Expression, and Target schema. We provide a detailed account of our extraction algorithms, discontinuous argument handling, annotation corrections, and statistical analysis of the resulting dataset. This work offers a reusable resource for researchers aiming to leverage SRL for enhancing ORL, especially in low-resource opinion mining scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in social contexts, motivating analysis of how they express and shift moral judgments. In this work, we investigate the moral response of LLMs to persona role-play, prompting a LLM to assume a specific character. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), we introduce a benchmark that quantifies two properties: moral susceptibility and moral robustness, defined from the variability of MFQ scores across and within personas, respectively. We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level. Additionally, we present moral foundation profiles for models without persona role-play and for personas averaged across models. Together, these analyses provide a systematic view of how persona conditioning shapes moral behavior in large language models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially under parameter constraints, is crucial for real-world applications. Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/TaH.

arXiv:2511.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can language models (LMs) learn to faithfully describe their internal computations? Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.

<title>LLaDA-Rec: Discrete Diffusion for Parallel Semantic ID Generation in Generative Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Generative recommendation represents each item as a semantic ID, i.e., a sequence of discrete tokens, and generates the next item through autoregressive decoding. While effective, existing autoregressive models face two intrinsic limitations: (1) unidirectional constraints, where causal attention restricts each token to attend only to its predecessors, hindering global semantic modeling; and (2) error accumulation, where the fixed left-to-right generation order causes prediction errors in early tokens to propagate to the predictions of subsequent token. To address these issues, we propose LLaDA-Rec, a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates recommendation as parallel semantic ID generation. By combining bidirectional attention with the adaptive generation order, the approach models inter-item and intra-item dependencies more effectively and alleviates error accumulation. Specifically, our approach comprises three key designs: (1) a parallel tokenization scheme that produces semantic IDs for bidirectional modeling, addressing the mismatch between residual quantization and bidirectional architectures; (2) two masking mechanisms at the user-history and next-item levels to capture both inter-item sequential dependencies and intra-item semantic relationships; and (3) an adapted beam search strategy for adaptive-order discrete diffusion decoding, resolving the incompatibility of standard beam search with diffusion-based generation. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that LLaDA-Rec consistently outperforms both ID-based and state-of-the-art generative recommenders, establishing discrete diffusion as a new paradigm for generative recommendation.

Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) has recently gained increased attention within the AI community for providing a standardized way for large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and services, significantly enhancing their capabilities. However, the inclusion of extensive contextual information, including system prompts, MCP tool definitions, and context histories, in MCP-enabled LLM interactions, dramatically inflates token usage. Given that LLM providers charge based on tokens, these expanded contexts can quickly escalate monetary costs and increase the computational load on LLM services. This paper presents a comprehensive measurement-based analysis of MCP-enabled interactions with LLMs, revealing trade-offs between capability, performance, and cost. We explore how different LLM models and MCP configurations impact key performance metrics such as token efficiency, monetary cost, task completion times, and task success rates, and suggest potential optimizations, including enabling parallel tool calls and implementing robust task abort mechanisms. These findings provide useful insights for developing more efficient, robust, and cost-effective MCP-enabled workflows.

<title>The Polite Liar: Epistemic Pathology in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a peculiar epistemic pathology: they speak as if they know, even when they do not. This paper argues that such confident fabrication, what I call the polite liar, is a structural consequence of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Building on Frankfurt's analysis of bullshit as communicative indifference to truth, I show that this pathology is not deception but structural indifference: a reward architecture that optimizes for perceived sincerity over evidential accuracy. Current alignment methods reward models for being helpful, harmless, and polite, but not for being epistemically grounded. As a result, systems learn to maximize user satisfaction rather than truth, performing conversational fluency as a virtue. I analyze this behavior through the lenses of epistemic virtue theory, speech-act philosophy, and cognitive alignment, showing that RLHF produces agents trained to mimic epistemic confidence without access to epistemic justification. The polite liar thus reveals a deeper alignment tension between linguistic cooperation and epistemic integrity. The paper concludes with an "epistemic alignment" principle: reward justified confidence over perceived fluency.

Abstract: Large Language Models require substantial computational resources for inference, posing deployment challenges. While dynamic pruning offers superior efficiency over static methods through adaptive circuit selection, it exacerbates alignment degradation by retaining only input-dependent safety-critical circuit preservation across diverse inputs. As a result, addressing these heightened alignment vulnerabilities remains critical. We introduce Alignment-Aware Probe Pruning (AAPP), a dynamic structured pruning method that adaptively preserves alignment-relevant circuits during inference, building upon Probe Pruning. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12B-IT show AAPP improves refusal rates by 50\% at matched compute, enabling efficient yet safety-preserving LLM deployment.

Abstract: Community Unionism has served as a pivotal concept in debates on trade union renewal since the early 2000s, yet its theoretical coherence and political significance remain unresolved. This article investigates why CU has gained such prominence -- not by testing its efficacy, but by mapping how it is constructed, cited, and contested across the scholarly literature. Using two complementary systematic approaches -- a citation network analysis of 114 documents and a thematic review of 18 core CU case studies -- I examine how CU functions as both an empirical descriptor and a normative ideal. The analysis reveals CU's dual genealogy: positioned by British scholars as an indigenous return to historic rank-and-file practices, yet structurally aligned with transnational social movement unionism. Thematic coding shows near-universal emphasis on coalition-building and alliances, but deep ambivalence toward class politics. This tension suggests CU's significance lies less in operationalising a new union model, and more in managing contradictions -- between workplace and community, leadership and rank-and-file, reform and radicalism -- within a shrinking labour movement.

<title>A Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation System with Source Reliabilities Secured on Blockchain</title>

Abstract: Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems typically use a centralized architecture, causing a high cost of data collection, integration, and management, as well as privacy concerns. There is a great need for a decentralized RAG system that enables foundation models to utilize information directly from data owners who maintain full control over their sources. However, decentralization brings a challenge: the numerous independent data sources vary significantly in reliability, which can diminish retrieval accuracy and response quality. To address this, our decentralized RAG system has a novel reliability scoring mechanism that dynamically evaluates each source based on the quality of responses it contributes to generate and prioritizes high-quality sources during retrieval. To ensure transparency and trust, the scoring process is securely managed through blockchain-based smart contracts, creating verifiable and tamper-proof reliability records without relying on a central authority. We evaluate our decentralized system with two Llama models (3B and 8B) in two simulated environments where six data sources have different levels of reliability. Our system achieves a +10.7\% performance improvement over its centralized counterpart in the real world-like unreliable data environments. Notably, it approaches the upper-bound performance of centralized systems under ideally reliable data environments. The decentralized infrastructure enables secure and trustworthy scoring management, achieving approximately 56\% marginal cost savings through batched update operations. Our code and system are open-sourced at github.com/yining610/Reliable-dRAG.

Abstract: Effective information retrieval requires reasoning over partial evidence and refining strategies as information emerges. Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks. These findings suggest that retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise.

Abstract: Financial institutions deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) for reconciliations, regulatory reporting, and client communications, but nondeterministic outputs (output drift) undermine auditability and trust. We quantify drift across five model architectures (7B-120B parameters) on regulated financial tasks, revealing a stark inverse relationship: smaller models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieve 100% output consistency at T=0.0, while GPT-OSS-120B exhibits only 12.5% consistency (95% CI: 3.5-36.0%) regardless of configuration (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test). This finding challenges conventional assumptions that larger models are universally superior for production deployment.
  Our contributions include: (i) a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness combining greedy decoding (T=0.0), fixed seeds, and SEC 10-K structure-aware retrieval ordering; (ii) task-specific invariant checking for RAG, JSON, and SQL outputs using finance-calibrated materiality thresholds (plus or minus 5%) and SEC citation validation; (iii) a three-tier model classification system enabling risk-appropriate deployment decisions; and (iv) an audit-ready attestation system with dual-provider validation.
  We evaluated five models (Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama, Granite-3-8B via IBM watsonx.ai, Llama-3.3-70B, Mistral-Medium-2505, and GPT-OSS-120B) across three regulated financial tasks. Across 480 runs (n=16 per condition), structured tasks (SQL) remain stable even at T=0.2, while RAG tasks show drift (25-75%), revealing task-dependent sensitivity. Cross-provider validation confirms deterministic behavior transfers between local and cloud deployments. We map our framework to Financial Stability Board (FSB), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requirements, demonstrating practical pathways for compliance-ready AI deployments.

<title>Beyond Fact Retrieval: Episodic Memory for RAG with Generative Semantic Workspaces</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in long-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finite context windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation with external memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \textbf{20\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \textbf{51\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) is an emerging agent application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address open-ended queries. It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

Abstract: Can we turn a video prediction model into a robot policy? Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks. We will release models and code at https://vipra-project.github.io

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into personal assistants with access to sensitive user data, they face a critical privacy challenge: while prior work has addressed output-level privacy, recent findings reveal that LLMs often leak private information through their internal reasoning processes, violating contextual privacy expectations. These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility. Our work establishes SALT as a practical approach for test-time privacy protection in reasoning-capable language models, offering a path toward safer deployment of LLM-based personal agents.

Abstract: Sentiments about the reproducibility of cited papers in downstream literature offer community perspectives and have shown as a promising signal of the actual reproducibility of published findings. To train effective models to effectively predict reproducibility-oriented sentiments and further systematically study their correlation with reproducibility, we introduce the CC30k dataset, comprising a total of 30,734 citation contexts in machine learning papers. Each citation context is labeled with one of three reproducibility-oriented sentiment labels: Positive, Negative, or Neutral, reflecting the cited paper's perceived reproducibility or replicability. Of these, 25,829 are labeled through crowdsourcing, supplemented with negatives generated through a controlled pipeline to counter the scarcity of negative labels. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis datasets, CC30k focuses on reproducibility-oriented sentiments, addressing a research gap in resources for computational reproducibility studies. The dataset was created through a pipeline that includes robust data cleansing, careful crowd selection, and thorough validation. The resulting dataset achieves a labeling accuracy of 94%. We then demonstrated that the performance of three large language models significantly improves on the reproducibility-oriented sentiment classification after fine-tuning using our dataset. The dataset lays the foundation for large-scale assessments of the reproducibility of machine learning papers. The CC30k dataset and the Jupyter notebooks used to produce and analyze the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/lamps-lab/CC30k .

<title>LLM-Powered Fully Automated Chaos Engineering: Towards Enabling Anyone to Build Resilient Software Systems at Low Cost</title>

Abstract: Chaos Engineering (CE) is an engineering technique aimed at improving the resilience of distributed systems. It involves intentionally injecting faults into a system to test its resilience, uncover weaknesses, and address them before they cause failures in production. Recent CE tools automate the execution of predefined CE experiments. However, planning such experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. These processes are labor-intensive and require multi-domain expertise. To address these challenges and enable anyone to build resilient systems at low cost, this paper proposes ChaosEater, a system that automates the entire CE cycle with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines an agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided processes within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for software systems built on Kubernetes. Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater complete CE cycles through software engineering tasks, including requirement definition, code generation, testing, and debugging. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on small- and large-scale Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it consistently completes reasonable CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. Its cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, their inference incurs substantial computational resources, exposing them to energy-latency attacks, where crafted prompts induce high energy and latency cost. Existing attack methods aim to prolong output by delaying the generation of termination symbols. However, as the output grows longer, controlling the termination symbols through input becomes difficult, making these methods less effective. Therefore, we propose LoopLLM, an energy-latency attack framework based on the observation that repetitive generation can trigger low-entropy decoding loops, reliably compelling LLMs to generate until their output limits. LoopLLM introduces (1) a repetition-inducing prompt optimization that exploits autoregressive vulnerabilities to induce repetitive generation, and (2) a token-aligned ensemble optimization that aggregates gradients to improve cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments on 12 open-source and 2 commercial LLMs show that LoopLLM significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 90% of the maximum output length, compared to 20% for baselines, and improving transferability by around 40% to DeepSeek-V3 and Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness for systematic intelligence-per-watt benchmarking.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are a core component in the post-training of large language models (LLMs), serving as proxies for human preference evaluation and guiding model alignment. However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.

Abstract: Aligning large generative models with human feedback is a critical challenge. In speech synthesis, this is particularly pronounced due to the lack of a large-scale human preference dataset, which hinders the development of models that truly align with human perception. To address this, we introduce SpeechJudge, a comprehensive suite comprising a dataset, a benchmark, and a reward model centered on naturalness--one of the most fundamental subjective metrics for speech synthesis. First, we present SpeechJudge-Data, a large-scale human feedback corpus of 99K speech pairs. The dataset is constructed using a diverse set of advanced zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models across diverse speech styles and multiple languages, with human annotations for both intelligibility and naturalness preference. From this, we establish SpeechJudge-Eval, a challenging benchmark for speech naturalness judgment. Our evaluation reveals that existing metrics and AudioLLMs struggle with this task; the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves less than 70% agreement with human judgment, highlighting a significant gap for improvement. To bridge this gap, we develop SpeechJudge-GRM, a generative reward model (GRM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni-7B. It is trained on SpeechJudge-Data via a two-stage post-training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought rationales followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with GRPO on challenging cases. On the SpeechJudge-Eval benchmark, the proposed SpeechJudge-GRM demonstrates superior performance, achieving 77.2% accuracy (and 79.4% after inference-time scaling @10) compared to a classic Bradley-Terry reward model (72.7%). Furthermore, SpeechJudge-GRM can be also employed as a reward function during the post-training of speech generation models to facilitate their alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenSPG/KAG-Thinker.

Abstract: Hard negatives are essential for training effective retrieval models. Hard-negative mining typically relies on ranking documents using cross-encoders or static embedding models based on similarity metrics such as cosine distance. Hard negative mining becomes challenging for biomedical and scientific domains due to the difficulty in distinguishing between source and hard negative documents. However, referenced documents naturally share contextual relevance with the source document but are not duplicates, making them well-suited as hard negatives. In this work, we propose BiCA: Biomedical Dense Retrieval with Citation-Aware Hard Negatives, an approach for hard-negative mining by utilizing citation links in 20,000 PubMed articles for improving a domain-specific small dense retriever. We fine-tune the GTE_small and GTE_Base models using these citation-informed negatives and observe consistent improvements in zero-shot dense retrieval using nDCG@10 for both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks on BEIR and outperform baselines on long-tailed topics in LoTTE using Success@5. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging document link structure to generate highly informative negatives, enabling state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning and demonstrating a path towards highly data-efficient domain adaptation.

Abstract: In modern sequential decision-making systems, the construction of an optimal candidate action space is critical to efficient inference. However, existing approaches either rely on manually defined action spaces that lack scalability or utilize unstructured spaces that render exhaustive search computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named \textsc{DynaAct} for automatically constructing a compact action space to enhance sequential reasoning in complex problem-solving scenarios. Our method first estimates a proxy for the complete action space by extracting general sketches observed in a corpus covering diverse complex reasoning problems using large language models. We then formulate a submodular function that jointly evaluates candidate actions based on their utility to the current state and their diversity, and employ a greedy algorithm to select an optimal candidate set. Extensive experiments on six diverse standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves overall performance, while maintaining efficient inference without introducing substantial latency. The implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaoxlpku/DynaAct.

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated sophisticated problem-solving capabilities on various benchmarks through advanced reasoning algorithms. However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types. Our findings also corroborate the alignment of the proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework with human cognitive processes.

<title>Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression</title>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

<title>Pruning as Regularization: Sensitivity-Aware One-Shot Pruning in ASR</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08092</link>

Abstract: We challenge the conventional view of neural network pruning as solely a compression technique, demonstrating that one-shot magnitude pruning serves as a powerful implicit regularizer for ASR. Using Whisper-small, we combine gradient- and Fisher-based sensitivity diagnostics with targeted, component-wise pruning. This reveals architectural asymmetries: decoder FFNs are pruning-fragile, whereas decoder self-attention and the last encoder layers contain redundancy that, when removed, improves generalization. Without fine-tuning, pruning 50% of decoder self-attention reduces WER by 2.38% absolute (20.44% relative) on LibriSpeech test-other; pruning the last four encoder layers at 50% instead yields a 1.72% absolute (14.8% relative) improvement. Gains persisted on Common Voice and TED-LIUM datasets. Beyond regularization benefits, our sensitivity-aware approach enables more aggressive one-shot compression. At 40% sparsity, where established global pruning approaches catastrophically fail, our method preserves near-baseline accuracy. This positions pruning as a first-class architectural design tool: knowing where to prune is as important as how much to prune.

Abstract: Large speech recognition models like Whisper-small achieve high accuracy but are difficult to deploy on edge devices due to their high computational demand. To this end, we present a unified, cross-library evaluation of post-training quantization (PTQ) on Whisper-small that disentangles the impact of quantization scheme, method, granularity, and bit-width. Our study is based on four libraries: PyTorch, Optimum-Quanto, HQQ, and bitsandbytes. Experiments on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other show that dynamic int8 quantization with Quanto offers the best trade-off, reducing model size by 57% while improving on the baseline's word error rate. Static quantization performed worse, likely due to Whisper's Transformer architecture, while more aggressive formats (e.g., nf4, int3) achieved up to 71% compression at the cost of accuracy in noisy conditions. Overall, our results demonstrate that carefully chosen PTQ methods can substantially reduce model size and inference cost without retraining, enabling efficient deployment of Whisper-small on constrained hardware.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models have significantly broadened their application in robotics and collaborative systems. However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of integrating active perception with perspective-taking mechanisms in advancing LLMs' application in robotics and multi-agent systems, setting a foundation for future research into adaptive and context-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled AI systems to achieve expert-level performance on domain-specific scientific tasks, yet these systems remain narrow and handcrafted. We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains. This work establishes SciAgent as a concrete step toward generalistic scientific intelligence-AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.

Abstract: As AI agents proliferate across industries and applications, evaluating their performance based solely on infrastructural metrics such as latency, time-to-first-token, or token throughput is proving insufficient. These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI). This work provides a robust, standardized methodology for the holistic evaluation of AI agents, paving the way for more effective development, deployment, and governance.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods commonly draw information from unstructured documents, the emerging paradigm of GraphRAG aims to leverage structured data such as knowledge graphs. Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building. This highlights how such an approach can bridge AI with real-world applications at scale, enabling industrial digital automation use cases.

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Classical (HQC) algorithms constitute one of the most effective paradigms for exploiting the computational advantages of quantum systems in large-scale numerical tasks. By operating in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, quantum circuits enable exponential speed-ups and provide access to richer representations of cost landscapes compared to purely classical methods. These capabilities are particularly relevant for machine learning, where state-of-the-art models especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suffer from prohibitive time complexity due to massive matrix multiplications and high-dimensional optimization.
  In this manuscript, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical selection mechanism for the Mamba architecture, designed specifically for temporal sequence classification problems. Our approach leverages Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as quantum gating modules that both enhance feature extraction and improve suppression of irrelevant information. This integration directly addresses the computational bottlenecks of deep learning architectures by exploiting quantum resources for more efficient representation learning.
  We analyze how introducing quantum subroutines into large language models (LLMs) impacts their generalization capability, expressivity, and parameter efficiency. The results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced gating mechanisms as a path toward scalable, resource-efficient NLP models, in a limited simulation step. Within the first four epochs on a reshaped MNIST dataset with input format (batch, 784, d_model), our hybrid model achieved 24.6% accuracy while using one quantum layer and achieve higher expressivity, compared to 21.6% obtained by a purely classical selection mechanism. we state No founding

Abstract: Speech Foundation Models have gained significant attention recently. Prior works have shown that the fusion of representations from multiple layers of the same model or the fusion of multiple models can improve performance on downstream tasks. We unify these two fusion strategies by proposing an interface module that enables fusion across multiple upstream speech models while integrating information across their layers. We conduct extensive experiments on different self-supervised and supervised models across various speech tasks, including ASR and paralinguistic analysis, and demonstrate that our method outperforms prior fusion approaches. We further analyze its scalability concerning model size and count, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate upstream models. Our results show that the proposed interface provides an additional performance boost when given a suitable upstream model selection, making it a promising approach for utilizing Speech Foundation Models.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly promoted and used in qualitative research, it also raises profound methodological issues. This position paper critically interrogates the role of generative AI (genAI) in the context of qualitative coding methodologies. Despite widespread hype and claims of efficiency, we propose that genAI is not methodologically valid within qualitative inquiries, and its use risks undermining the robustness and trustworthiness of qualitative research. The lack of meaningful documentation, commercial opacity, and the inherent tendencies of genAI systems to produce incorrect outputs all contribute to weakening methodological rigor. Overall, the balance between risk and benefits does not support the use of genAI in qualitative research, and our position paper cautions researchers to put sound methodology before technological novelty.

Abstract: Current safety evaluations for LLM-driven agents primarily focus on atomic harms, failing to address sophisticated threats where malicious intent is concealed or diluted within complex tasks. We address this gap with a two-dimensional analysis of agent safety brittleness under the orthogonal pressures of intent concealment and task complexity. To enable this, we introduce OASIS (Orthogonal Agent Safety Inquiry Suite), a hierarchical benchmark with fine-grained annotations and a high-fidelity simulation sandbox. Our findings reveal two critical phenomena: safety alignment degrades sharply and predictably as intent becomes obscured, and a "Complexity Paradox" emerges, where agents seem safer on harder tasks only due to capability limitations. By releasing OASIS and its simulation environment, we provide a principled foundation for probing and strengthening agent safety in these overlooked dimensions.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as chat assistants capable of generating human-like conversations has amplified the need for robust evaluation methods, particularly for open-ended tasks. Conventional metrics such as EM and F1, while useful, are inadequate for capturing the full semantics and contextual depth of such generative outputs. We propose a reference-guided verdict method that automates the evaluation process by leveraging multiple LLMs as judges. Through experiments on free-form question-answering tasks, we demonstrate that combining multiple models improves the reliability and accuracy of evaluations, especially in tasks where a single model may struggle. The results indicate a strong correlation with human evaluations, establishing the proposed method as a reliable alternative to traditional metrics.

Abstract: Advancements in natural language processing have revolutionized the way we can interact with digital information systems, such as databases, making them more accessible. However, challenges persist, especially when accuracy is critical, as in the biomedical domain. A key issue is the hallucination problem, where models generate information unsupported by the underlying data, potentially leading to dangerous misinformation. This paper presents a novel approach designed to bridge this gap by combining Large Language Models (LLM) and Knowledge Graphs (KG) to improve the accuracy and reliability of question-answering systems, on the example of a biomedical KG. Built on the LangChain framework, our method incorporates a query checker that ensures the syntactical and semantic validity of LLM-generated queries, which are then used to extract information from a Knowledge Graph, substantially reducing errors like hallucinations. We evaluated the overall performance using a new benchmark dataset of 50 biomedical questions, testing several LLMs, including GPT-4 Turbo and llama3:70b. Our results indicate that while GPT-4 Turbo outperforms other models in generating accurate queries, open-source models like llama3:70b show promise with appropriate prompt engineering. To make this approach accessible, a user-friendly web-based interface has been developed, allowing users to input natural language queries, view generated and corrected Cypher queries, and verify the resulting paths for accuracy. Overall, this hybrid approach effectively addresses common issues such as data gaps and hallucinations, offering a reliable and intuitive solution for question answering systems.

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of large language models (LLMs). Recent work has explored using LLMs to rate and select data based on a small set of human-designed criteria (rules), but these approaches often rely heavily on heuristics, lack principled metrics for rule evaluation, and generalize poorly to new tasks. We propose a novel rule-based data selection framework that introduces a metric based on the orthogonality of rule score vectors to evaluate and select complementary rules. Our automated pipeline first uses LLMs to generate diverse rules covering multiple aspects of data quality, then rates samples according to these rules and applies the determinantal point process (DPP) to select the most independent rules. These rules are then used to score the full dataset, and high-scoring samples are selected for downstream tasks such as LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework in two experiment setups: (1) alignment with ground-truth ratings and (2) performance of LLMs fine-tuned on the selected data. Experiments across IMDB, Medical, Math, and Code domains demonstrate that our DPP-based rule selection consistently improves both rating accuracy and downstream model performance over strong baselines.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks combining textual and visual information, they continue to struggle with fine-grained visual perception tasks that require detailed pixel-level analysis. Effectively eliciting comprehensive reasoning from VLMs on such intricate visual elements remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present VipAct, an agent framework that enhances VLMs by integrating multi-agent collaboration and vision expert models, enabling more precise visual understanding and comprehensive reasoning. VipAct consists of an orchestrator agent, which manages task requirement analysis, planning, and coordination, along with specialized agents that handle specific tasks such as image captioning and vision expert models that provide high-precision perceptual information. This multi-agent approach allows VLMs to better perform fine-grained visual perception tasks by synergizing planning, reasoning, and tool use. We evaluate VipAct on benchmarks featuring a diverse set of visual perception tasks, with experimental results demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across all tasks. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies reveal the critical role of multi-agent collaboration in eliciting more detailed System-2 reasoning and highlight the importance of image input for task planning. Additionally, our error analysis identifies patterns of VLMs' inherent limitations in visual perception, providing insights into potential future improvements. VipAct offers a flexible and extensible framework, paving the way for more advanced visual perception systems across various real-world applications.

Abstract: Word embeddings and language models have transformed natural language processing (NLP) by facilitating the representation of linguistic elements in continuous vector spaces. This review visits foundational concepts such as the distributional hypothesis and contextual similarity, tracing the evolution from sparse representations like one-hot encoding to dense embeddings including Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText. We examine both static and contextualized embeddings, underscoring advancements in models such as ELMo, BERT, and GPT and their adaptations for cross-lingual and personalized applications. The discussion extends to sentence and document embeddings, covering aggregation methods and generative topic models, along with the application of embeddings in multimodal domains, including vision, robotics, and cognitive science. Advanced topics such as model compression, interpretability, numerical encoding, and bias mitigation are analyzed, addressing both technical challenges and ethical implications. Additionally, we identify future research directions, emphasizing the need for scalable training techniques, enhanced interpretability, and robust grounding in non-textual modalities. By synthesizing current methodologies and emerging trends, this survey offers researchers and practitioners an in-depth resource to push the boundaries of embedding-based language models.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the automated processing of lengthy documents even without supervised training on a task-specific dataset. Yet, their zero-shot performance in complex tasks as opposed to straightforward information extraction tasks remains suboptimal. One feasible approach for tasks with lengthy, complex input is to first summarize the document and then apply supervised fine-tuning to the summary. However, the summarization process inevitably results in some loss of information. In this study we present a method for processing the summaries of long documents aimed to capture different important aspects of the original document. We hypothesize that LLM summaries generated with different aspect-oriented prompts contain different information signals, and we propose methods to measure these differences. We introduce approaches to effectively integrate signals from these different summaries for supervised training of transformer models. We validate our hypotheses on a high-impact task -- 30-day readmission prediction from a psychiatric discharge -- using real-world data from four hospitals, and show that our proposed method increases the prediction performance for the complex task of predicting patient outcome.

Abstract: Long context is an important topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP), running through the development of NLP architectures, and offers immense opportunities for Large Language Models (LLMs), giving LLMs the lifelong learning potential akin to humans. Unfortunately, the pursuit of a long context is accompanied by numerous obstacles. Nevertheless, long context remains a core competitive advantage for LLMs. In the past two years, the context length of LLMs has achieved a breakthrough extension to millions of tokens. Moreover, research on long-context LLMs has expanded beyond length extrapolation to a comprehensive focus on architecture, infrastructure, training, and evaluation technologies.
  Inspired by the symphonic poem, Thus Spake Zarathustra, we draw an analogy between the journey of extending the context of LLM and the attempts of humans to transcend their mortality. In this survey, we will illustrate how LLM struggles between the tremendous need for a longer context and its equal need to accept the fact that it is ultimately finite. To achieve this, we give a global picture of the lifecycle of long-context LLMs from four perspectives: architecture, infrastructure, training, and evaluation, showcasing the full spectrum of long-context technologies. At the end of this survey, we will present 10 unanswered questions currently faced by long-context LLMs. We hope this survey can serve as a systematic introduction to research on long-context LLMs.

Abstract: Research on metaphor has steadily increased over the last decades, as this phenomenon opens a window into a range of linguistic and cognitive processes. At the same time, the demand for rigorously constructed and extensively normed experimental materials increased as well. Here, we present the Figurative Archive, an open database of 996 metaphors in Italian enriched with rating and corpus-based measures (from familiarity to semantic distance and preferred interpretations), derived by collecting stimuli used across 11 studies. It includes both everyday and literary metaphors, varying in structure and semantic domains, and is validated based on correlations between familiarity and other measures. The Archive has several aspects of novelty: it is increased in size compared to previous resources; it offers a measure of metaphor inclusiveness, to comply with recommendations for non-discriminatory language use; it is displayed in a web-based interface, with features for a customized consultation. We provide guidelines for using the Archive to source materials for studies investigating metaphor processing and relationships between metaphor features in humans and computational models.

<title>CLEV: LLM-Based Evaluation Through Lightweight Efficient Voting for Free-Form Question-Answering</title>

Abstract: Evaluating free-form Question Answering (QA) remains a challenge due to its diverse and open-ended nature. Traditional automatic metrics fail to capture semantic equivalence or accommodate the variability of open-ended responses. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators offers a promising alternative due to their strong language understanding and instruction-following capabilities. We propose Consensus via Lightweight Efficient Voting (CLEV), which employs two primary LLMs as judges and invokes a third judge only in cases of disagreement. This approach prioritizes evaluation reliability while reducing unnecessary computational demands. Through experiments, including human evaluation, we demonstrate CLEV's ability to provide consistent, scalable, and resource-efficient assessments, establishing it as a robust framework for evaluating LLMs on free-form QA.

Abstract: The rapid growth of social media platforms has led to concerns about radicalization, filter bubbles, and content bias. Existing approaches to classifying ideology are limited in that they require extensive human effort, the labeling of large datasets, and are not able to adapt to evolving ideological contexts. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for classifying the political ideology of online content through in-context learning (ICL). Our extensive experiments involving demonstration selection in label-balanced fashion, conducted on three datasets comprising news articles and YouTube videos, reveal that our approach significantly outperforms zero-shot and traditional supervised methods. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of metadata (e.g., content source and descriptions) on ideological classification and discuss its implications. Finally, we show how providing the source for political and non-political content influences the LLM's classification.

Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) often relies on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which requires human annotations to construct preference datasets. Given the challenge of assigning overall quality scores to data, recent works increasingly adopt fine-grained ratings based on multiple safety rules. In this paper, we discover a robust phenomenon: Rules with higher rating entropy tend to have lower accuracy in distinguishing human-preferred responses. Exploiting this insight, we propose ENCORE, a simple entropy-guided method to compose multi-head rewards by penalizing rules with high rating entropy. Theoretically, we show that such rules yield negligible weights under the Bradley-Terry loss during weight optimization, naturally justifying their penalization. Empirically, ENCORE consistently outperforms strong baselines, including random and uniform weighting, single-head Bradley-Terry, and LLM-as-a-judge, etc. on RewardBench safety tasks. Our method is completely training-free, generally applicable across datasets, and retains interpretability, making it a practical and effective approach for multi-attribute reward modeling.

Abstract: Naive joint training of large language models (LLMs) for multilingual preference alignment can suffer from negative interference. This is a known issue in multilingual training, where conflicting objectives degrade overall performance. However, the impact of this phenomenon in the context of multilingual preference alignment remains largely underexplored. To address this issue, we propose CONGRAD, a scalable and effective filtering method that selects high-quality preference samples with minimal gradient conflicts across languages. Our method leverages gradient surgery to retain samples aligned with an aggregated multilingual update direction. Additionally, we incorporate a sublinear gradient compression strategy that reduces memory overhead during gradient accumulation. We integrate CONGRAD into self-rewarding framework and evaluate on LLaMA3-8B and Gemma2-2B across 10 languages. Results show that CONGRAD consistently outperforms strong baselines in both seen and unseen languages, with minimal alignment tax.

Abstract: This paper introduces STAR-1, a high-quality, just-1k-scale safety dataset specifically designed for large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1. Built on three core principles -- diversity, deliberative reasoning, and rigorous filtering -- STAR-1 aims to address the critical needs for safety alignment in LRMs. Specifically, we begin by integrating existing open-source safety datasets from diverse sources. Then, we curate safety policies to generate policy-grounded deliberative reasoning samples. Lastly, we apply a GPT-4o-based safety scoring system to select training examples aligned with best practices. Experimental results show that fine-tuning LRMs with STAR-1 leads to an average 40% improvement in safety performance across four benchmarks, while only incurring a marginal decrease (e.g., an average of 1.1%) in reasoning ability measured across five reasoning tasks. Extensive ablation studies further validate the importance of our design principles in constructing STAR-1 and analyze its efficacy across both LRMs and traditional LLMs. Our project page is https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/STAR-1.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of generated text automatically remains a significant challenge. Conventional reference-based metrics have been shown to exhibit relatively weak correlation with human evaluations. Recent research advocates the use of large language models (LLMs) as source-based metrics for natural language generation (NLG) assessment. While promising, LLM-based metrics, particularly those using smaller models, still fall short in aligning with human judgments. In this work, we introduce ContrastScore, a contrastive evaluation metric designed to enable higher-quality, less biased, and more efficient assessment of generated text. We evaluate ContrastScore on two NLG tasks: machine translation and summarization. Experimental results show that ContrastScore consistently achieves stronger correlation with human judgments than both single-model and ensemble-based baselines. Notably, ContrastScore based on Qwen 3B and 0.5B even outperforms Qwen 7B, despite having only half as many parameters, demonstrating its efficiency. Furthermore, it effectively mitigates common evaluation biases such as length and likelihood preferences, resulting in more robust automatic evaluation.

Abstract: Standard topic models often struggle to capture culturally specific nuances in text. This study evaluates the effectiveness of contextual embeddings for identifying culturally resonant themes in an underrepresented linguistic context. We compare the performance of KMeans Clustering, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and BERTopic on a corpus of nearly 25,000 daily personal narratives written in Belgian-Dutch (Flemish). While LDA achieves strong performance on automated coherence metrics, subsequent human evaluation reveals that BERTopic consistently identifies the most coherent and culturally relevant topics, highlighting the limitations of purely statistical methods on this narrative-rich data. Furthermore, the diminished performance of K-Means compared to prior work on similar Dutch corpora underscores the unique linguistic challenges posed by personal narrative analysis. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of contextual embeddings in robust topic modeling and emphasize the need for human-centered evaluation, particularly when working with low-resource languages and culturally specific domains.

Abstract: End-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue systems have recently garnered increasing research attention for their lower latency and more natural integration of nonverbal cues such as emotion and speaker identity. However, these systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual knowledge, which hinders effective integration of information. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant textual knowledge from speech queries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency. Although the overall performance still lags behind the SOTA cascaded models, our framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in end-to-end S2S systems. Our code and dataset are released.

<title>On the generalization of language models from in-context learning and finetuning: a controlled study</title>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning. E.g. they can fail to generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, or fail to make simple logical deductions based on trained information. These failures to generalize factual information from fine-tuning can significantly hinder the reasoning capabilities of these models. On the other hand, language models' in-context learning (ICL) shows different inductive biases and deductive reasoning capabilities. Here, we explore these differences in generalization and deductive reasoning between in-context- and fine-tuning-based learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and improve models' abilities to make generalizations over factual information from novel data. These datasets are designed to create clean tests of generalization, by isolating the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining. We expose pretrained large models to controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either through ICL or fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched settings, ICL can generalize several types of inferences more flexibly than fine-tuning (though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context reasoning traces to finetuning data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for understanding the generalization afforded by different modes of learning in language models, and practically improving their performance.

<title>HAPO: Training Language Models to Reason Concisely via History-Aware Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: While scaling the length of responses at test-time has been shown to markedly improve the reasoning abilities and performance of large language models (LLMs), it often results in verbose outputs and increases inference cost. Prior approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span various difficulty levels. Experiment results demonstrate that HAPO effectively induces LLMs' concise reasoning abilities, producing length reductions of 33-59% with accuracy drops of only 2-5%.

Abstract: Model editing aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) by efficiently adjusting their internal parameters. Currently, most LLM editing datasets are confined to narrow knowledge domains and cover a limited range of editing evaluation. They often overlook the broad scope of editing demands and the diversity of ripple effects resulting from edits. In this context, we introduce UniEdit, a unified benchmark for LLM editing grounded in open-domain knowledge. First, we construct editing samples by selecting entities from 25 common domains across five major categories, utilizing the extensive triple knowledge available in open-domain knowledge graphs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domains. To address the issues of generality and locality in editing, we design an Neighborhood Multi-hop Chain Sampling (NMCS) algorithm to sample subgraphs based on a given knowledge piece to entail comprehensive ripple effects to evaluate. Finally, we employ proprietary LLMs to convert the sampled knowledge subgraphs into natural language text, guaranteeing grammatical accuracy and syntactical diversity. Extensive statistical analysis confirms the scale, comprehensiveness, and diversity of our UniEdit benchmark. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple LLMs and editors, analyzing their performance to highlight strengths and weaknesses in editing across open knowledge domains and various evaluation criteria, thereby offering valuable insights for future research endeavors.

Abstract: Private data holds promise for improving LLMs due to its high quality, but its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model parameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small portion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still face three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure transmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure, Efficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First, we inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure end-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression and KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training and inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on natural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show that FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and achieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

Abstract: We have only limited understanding of how and why large language models (LLMs) respond in the ways that they do. Their neural networks have proven challenging to interpret, and we are only beginning to tease out the function of individual neurons and circuits within them. However, another path to understanding these systems is to investigate and develop their capacity to explain their own functioning. Here, we show that i) LLMs can accurately describe quantitative features of their own internal processes during certain kinds of decision-making and ii) that it is possible to improve these capabilities through training. To do so, we fine-tuned GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini to make decisions in a wide variety of complex contexts (e.g., choosing between condos, loans, vacations, etc.) according to randomly-generated, quantitative preferences about how to weigh different attributes (e.g., the relative importance of natural light versus quiet surroundings for condos). We demonstrate that the LLMs can accurately report these preferences (i.e., the weights that they learned to give to different attributes during decision-making). Next, we demonstrate that these LLMs can be fine-tuned to explain their decision-making even more accurately. Finally, we demonstrate that this training generalizes: It improves the ability of the models to accurately explain how they make other complex decisions, not just decisions they have been fine-tuned to make. This work is a step towards training LLMs to accurately and broadly report on their own internal processes -- a possibility that would yield substantial benefits for interpretability, control, and safety.

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with complex queries that lack strong signals to retrieve the most relevant context, forcing a trade-off between choosing a small context that misses key information and a large context that confuses the LLM. To address this, we propose Forward-Backward RAG (FB-RAG), a new training-free framework based on a simple yet powerful forward-looking strategy. FB-RAG employs a light-weight LLM to peek into potential future generations, using evidence from multiple sampled outputs to precisely identify the most relevant context for a final, more powerful generator. This improves performance without complex finetuning or Reinforcement Learning common in prior work. Across $9$ datasets from LongBench and $\infty$Bench, FB-RAG consistently delivers strong results. Further, the performance gains can be achieved with reduced latency due to a shorter, more focused prompt for the powerful generator. On EN.QA dataset, FB-RAG matches the leading baseline with over $48$% latency reduction or achieves an $8$% performance improvement with a $10$% latency reduction. Our analysis finds cases where even when the forward-looking LLM fails to generate correct answers, its attempts are sufficient to guide the final model to an accurate response, demonstrating how smaller LLMs can systematically improve the performance and efficiency of larger ones.

Abstract: Table question answering (TQA) focuses on answering questions based on tabular data. Developing TQA systems targets effective interaction with tabular data for tasks such as cell retrieval and data analysis. While recent work has leveraged fine-tuning to improve TQA systems, existing approaches often under-utilize available data and neglect the potential of post-training for further gains. In this work, we introduce p2-TQA, a process-based preference learning framework for TQA post-training. p2-TQA automatically constructs process-based preference data via a table-specific pipeline, eliminating the need for manual or costly data collection. It then optimizes models through contrastive learning on the collected data. Experiments show that p2-TQA effectively improves TQA models by up to 5% on in-domain datasets and 2.4% on out-of-domain datasets with only 8,000 training instances. Furthermore, models enhanced with p2-TQA achieve competitive results against larger, more complex state-of-the-art TQA systems, while maintaining up to five times higher efficiency.

Abstract: Despite doubts on data quality, instruction synthesis has been widely applied into instruction tuning (IT) of LLMs as an economic and rapid alternative. Recent endeavors focus on improving data quality for synthesized instruction pairs in English and have facilitated IT of English-centric LLMs. However, data quality issues in multilingual synthesized instruction pairs are even more severe, since the common synthesizing practice is to translate English synthesized data into other languages using machine translation (MT). Besides the known content errors in these English synthesized data, multilingual synthesized instruction data are further exposed to defects introduced by MT and face insufficient localization of the target languages, leading to cultural inequality in trained LLMs. In this paper, we propose MIDB, a Multilingual Instruction Data Booster to automatically address the quality issues in multilingual synthesized data. MIDB is trained on around 36.8k revision examples across 16 languages by human linguistic experts, thereby can boost the low-quality data by addressing content errors and MT defects, and improving localization in these synthesized data. Both automatic and human evaluation indicate that not only MIDB steadily improved instruction data quality in 16 languages, but also the instruction-following and cultural-understanding abilities of multilingual LLMs fine-tuned on MIDB-boosted data were significantly enhanced, suggesting an improved linguistic and cultural equality.

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental facet of human experience, varying across individuals, cultural contexts, and nationalities. Given the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) as role-playing agents, we examine whether LLMs exhibit emotional stereotypes when assigned nationality-specific personas. Specifically, we investigate how different countries are represented in pre-trained LLMs through emotion attributions and whether these attributions align with cultural norms. To provide a deeper interpretive lens, we incorporate four key cultural dimensions, namely Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, and Individualism, derived from Hofstedes cross-cultural framework. Our analysis reveals significant nationality-based differences, with emotions such as shame, fear, and joy being disproportionately assigned across regions. Furthermore, we observe notable misalignment between LLM-generated and human emotional responses, particularly for negative emotions, highlighting the presence of reductive and potentially biased stereotypes in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Navigation instruction generation for visually impaired (VI) individuals (NIG-VI) is critical yet relatively underexplored. This study focuses on generating precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are practically usable for VI users. Specifically, we propose LaF-GRPO (LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to navigation instructions, thereby providing feedback rewards to guide the post-training of a Vision-Language Model (VLM). This enhances instruction accuracy and usability while reducing costly real-world data collection needs. To address the scarcity of dedicated benchmarks in this field, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-source dataset to facilitate training and evaluation. It comprises diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial coordinates, supporting detailed and open-ended in-situ instruction generation. Experiments on NIG4VI demonstrate the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO through quantitative metrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU 14\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542 vs. GPT-4o 0.323), and qualitative analysis further confirms that our method yields more intuitive and safer instructions.

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models, or diffusion LLMs, have emerged as a significant focus in NLP research, with substantial effort directed toward understanding their scalability and downstream task performance. However, their long-context capabilities remain unexplored, lacking systematic analysis or methods for context extension. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation comparing the long-context performance of diffusion LLMs and traditional auto-regressive LLMs. We first identify a unique characteristic of diffusion LLMs, unlike auto-regressive LLMs, they maintain remarkably stable perplexity during direct context extrapolation. Moreover, where auto-regressive models fail outright during the Needle-In-A-Haystack task with context exceeding their pretrained length, we discover diffusion LLMs exhibit a distinct local perception phenomenon, enabling successful retrieval from recent context segments. We explain both phenomena through the lens of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) scaling theory. Building on these observations, we propose LongLLaDA, a training-free method that integrates LLaDA with the NTK-based RoPE extrapolation. Our results validate that established extrapolation scaling laws remain effective for extending the context windows of diffusion LLMs. Furthermore, we identify long-context tasks where diffusion LLMs outperform auto-regressive LLMs and others where they fall short. Consequently, this study establishes the first length extrapolation method for diffusion LLMs while providing essential theoretical insights and empirical benchmarks critical for advancing future research on long-context diffusion LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenMOSS/LongLLaDA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face an inherent challenge: their knowledge is confined to the data that they have been trained on. To overcome this issue, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived knowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three stages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes a significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is mapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) algorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant items. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement overheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these overheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that accelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing works that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to ISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected by ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting performance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system tailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms. First, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to their associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables efficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that distributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a lightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that uses the existing computational resources inside the storage system. Compared to a server-grade system, REIS improves the performance (energy efficiency) of retrieval by an average of 13x (55x).

Abstract: The public often attributes human-like qualities to large language models (LLMs) and assumes they "know" certain things. In reality, LLMs encode information retained during training as internal probabilistic knowledge. This study examines existing methods for probing the veracity of that knowledge and identifies several flawed underlying assumptions. To address these flaws, we introduce sAwMIL (Sparse-Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a multiclass probing framework that combines multiple-instance learning with conformal prediction. sAwMIL leverages internal activations of LLMs to classify statements as true, false, or neither. We evaluate sAwMIL across 16 open-source LLMs, including default and chat-based variants, on three new curated datasets. Our results show that (1) common probing methods fail to provide a reliable and transferable veracity direction and, in some settings, perform worse than zero-shot prompting; (2) truth and falsehood are not encoded symmetrically; and (3) LLMs encode a third type of signal that is distinct from both true and false.

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark, IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new, diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and code.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models' (LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support. Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2) supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for clinical question answering and medical information analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing with user-stated opinions even when those contradict factual knowledge. While prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence. We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts (``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment and truthful AI systems.

Abstract: Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it has been unclear how and where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we build on an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling their overlap and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our experiments, we introduce MUREL, a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens spanning six different cultures. Our localization and intervention experiments show that LLMs encode different cultures in distinct neuron populations, predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated largely independently of language-specific neurons or those specific to other cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited, with implications for fairness, inclusivity, and alignment. Code and data are available at https://github.com/namazifard/Culture_Neurons.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Explainable Natural Language Processing (NLP), textual explanations, i.e., human-like rationales, are pivotal for explaining model predictions and enriching datasets with interpretable labels. Traditional approaches rely on human annotation, which is costly, labor-intensive, and impedes scalability. In this work, we present an automated framework that leverages multiple state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality textual explanations. We rigorously assess the quality of these LLM-generated explanations using a comprehensive suite of Natural Language Generation (NLG) metrics. Furthermore, we investigate the downstream impact of these explanations on the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and LLMs across natural language inference tasks on two diverse benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that automated explanations exhibit highly competitive effectiveness compared to human-annotated explanations in improving model performance. Our findings underscore a promising avenue for scalable, automated LLM-based textual explanation generation for extending NLP datasets and enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off, we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the AppWorld environment using different sized language models.
  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles, SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce subtask error rates.

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN, a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini. It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp), demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

<title>Trust Me, I Can Convince You: The Contextualized Argument Appraisal Framework</title>

Abstract: Emotions that somebody develops based on an argument do not only depend on the argument itself - they are also influenced by a subjective evaluation of the argument's potential impact on the self. For instance, an argument to ban plastic bottles might cause fear of losing a job for a bottle industry worker, which lowers the convincingness - presumably independent of its content. While binary emotionality of arguments has been studied, such cognitive appraisal models have only been proposed in other subtasks of emotion analysis, but not in the context of arguments and their convincingness. To fill this research gap, we propose the Contextualized Argument Appraisal Framework to model the interplay between the sender, receiver, and argument. We adapt established appraisal models from psychology to argument mining, including argument pleasantness, familiarity, response urgency, and expected effort, as well as convincingness variables. To evaluate the framework and pave the way for computational modeling, we develop a novel role-playing-based annotation setup, mimicking real-world exposure to arguments. Participants disclose their emotion, explain the main cause, the argument appraisal, and the perceived convincingness. To consider the subjective nature of such annotations, we also collect demographic data and personality traits of both the participants and ask them to disclose the same variables for their perception of the argument sender. The analysis of the resulting ContArgA corpus of 4000 annotations reveals that convincingness is positively correlated with positive emotions (e.g., trust) and negatively correlated with negative emotions (e.g., anger). The appraisal variables particularly point to the importance of the annotator's familiarity with the argument.

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423 human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping, and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

<title>Epistemic Diversity and Knowledge Collapse in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding. TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS, Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations, bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate, scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions: varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned internal representation.

Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.

Abstract: We introduce OpenVLThinker, one of the first open-source large vision-language models (LVLMs) to exhibit sophisticated chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving notable performance gains on challenging visual reasoning tasks. While text-based reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek R1) show promising results in text-only tasks, distilling their reasoning into LVLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in performance degradation due to imprecise visual grounding. Conversely, purely reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods face a large search space, hindering the emergence of reflective behaviors in smaller models (e.g., 7B LVLMs). Surprisingly, alternating between SFT and RL ultimately results in significant performance improvements after a few iterations. Our analysis reveals that the base model rarely exhibits reasoning behaviors initially, but SFT effectively surfaces these latent actions and narrows the RL search space, accelerating the development of reasoning capabilities. Each subsequent RL stage further refines the model's reasoning skills, producing higher-quality SFT data for continued self-improvement. OpenVLThinker-7B consistently advances performance across six benchmarks demanding mathematical and general reasoning, notably improving MathVista by 3.8%, EMMA by 2.4%, and HallusionBench by 1.6%. Beyond demonstrating the synergy between SFT and RL for complex reasoning tasks, our findings provide early evidence towards achieving R1-style reasoning in multimodal contexts. The code, model and data are held at https://github.com/yihedeng9/OpenVLThinker.

Abstract: When captioning an image, people describe objects in diverse ways, such as by using different terms and/or including details that are perceptually noteworthy to them. Descriptions can be especially unique across languages and cultures. Modern vision-language models (VLMs) gain understanding of images with text in different languages often through training on machine translations of English captions. However, this process relies on input content written from the perception of English speakers, leading to a perceptual bias. In this work, we outline a framework to address this bias. We specifically use a small amount of native speaker data, nearest-neighbor example guidance, and multimodal LLM reasoning to augment captions to better reflect descriptions in a target language. When adding the resulting rewrites to multilingual CLIP finetuning, we improve on German and Japanese text-image retrieval case studies (up to +3.5 mean recall, +4.4 on native vs. translation errors). We also propose a mechanism to build understanding of object description variation across languages, and offer insights into cross-dataset and cross-language generalization.

Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes interface mapping for large language models (LLMs) to access external data and tools, which revolutionizes the paradigm of tool selection and facilitates the rapid expansion of the LLM agent tool ecosystem. However, as the MCP is increasingly adopted, third-party customized versions of the MCP server expose potential security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we first introduce a novel security threat, which we term the MCP Preference Manipulation Attack (MPMA). An attacker deploys a customized MCP server to manipulate LLMs, causing them to prioritize it over other competing MCP servers. This can result in economic benefits for attackers, such as revenue from paid MCP services or advertising income generated from free servers. To achieve MPMA, we first design a Direct Preference Manipulation Attack (DPMA) that achieves significant effectiveness by inserting the manipulative word and phrases into the tool name and description. However, such a direct modification is obvious to users and lacks stealthiness. To address these limitations, we further propose Genetic-based Advertising Preference Manipulation Attack (GAPMA). GAPMA employs four commonly used strategies to initialize descriptions and integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to enhance stealthiness. The experiment results demonstrate that GAPMA balances high effectiveness and stealthiness. Our study reveals a critical vulnerability of the MCP in open ecosystems, highlighting an urgent need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure the fairness of the MCP ecosystem.

<title>Internal Causal Mechanisms Robustly Predict Language Model Out-of-Distribution Behaviors</title>

Abstract: Interpretability research now offers a variety of techniques for identifying abstract internal mechanisms in neural networks. Can such techniques be used to predict how models will behave on out-of-distribution examples? In this work, we provide a positive answer to this question. Through a diverse set of language modeling tasks--including symbol manipulation, knowledge retrieval, and instruction following--we show that the most robust features for correctness prediction are those that play a distinctive causal role in the model's behavior. Specifically, we propose two methods that leverage causal mechanisms to predict the correctness of model outputs: counterfactual simulation (checking whether key causal variables are realized) and value probing (using the values of those variables to make predictions). Both achieve high AUC-ROC in distribution and outperform methods that rely on causal-agnostic features in out-of-distribution settings, where predicting model behaviors is more crucial. Our work thus highlights a novel and significant application for internal causal analysis of language models.

<title>ConfGuard: A Simple and Effective Backdoor Detection for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Large Language Models (LLMs), where adversaries can embed hidden triggers to manipulate LLM's outputs. Most existing defense methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, are ineffective against the autoregressive nature and vast output space of LLMs, thereby suffering from poor performance and high latency. To address these limitations, we investigate the behavioral discrepancies between benign and backdoored LLMs in output space. We identify a critical phenomenon which we term sequence lock: a backdoored model generates the target sequence with abnormally high and consistent confidence compared to benign generation. Building on this insight, we propose ConfGuard, a lightweight and effective detection method that monitors a sliding window of token confidences to identify sequence lock. Extensive experiments demonstrate ConfGuard achieves a near 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and a negligible false positive rate (FPR) in the vast majority of cases. Crucially, the ConfGuard enables real-time detection almost without additional latency, making it a practical backdoor defense for real-world LLM deployments.

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge (Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking, Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and \textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation}, \textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and \textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

<title>Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models for the Machine-Assisted Resolution of User Intentions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08576</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional, GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However, extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative. This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded intelligence.

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization, and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances. Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at \href{https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/DynaSolidGeo/}{DynaSolidGeo}.

<div> Keywords: human smuggling networks, legal case documents, knowledge graph construction, coreference resolution, LLM-based pipelines

Summary: 
- Human smuggling networks are evolving and challenging to analyze, with legal case documents providing crucial insights but posing difficulties due to their complex and ambiguous nature.
- Current LLM-based approaches have limitations in generating structured knowledge graphs from these documents, leading to noisy and fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes.
- The CORE-KG framework addresses these challenges by incorporating a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing duplication and legal noise.
- An ablation study of CORE-KG highlights the importance of both coreference resolution and structured prompts in minimizing node duplication and noisy nodes.
- Removing coreference resolution results in increased node duplication and noisy nodes, while removing structured prompts leads to further duplication and noise. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex legal texts.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze. Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured, lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.25% increase in node duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured prompts leads to a 4.29% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex legal texts.

Summary:
- Diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a parallel decoding process but often underperform autoregressive models in speed.
- This study systematically examines DLM efficiency, pointing out issues in prior evaluation methods.
- Empirical benchmarking and theoretical analysis show that autoregressive models achieve higher throughput compared to DLMs.
- Acceleration strategies such as dual cache and parallel decoding provide benefits mainly at small batch sizes.
- The study emphasizes the need for robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies to enhance research on DLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through empirical benchmarking and a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies to advance research on DLMs.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces the concept of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) as a shift from traditional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL). It contrasts single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) in Agentic RL. The survey proposes a taxonomy focusing on agentic capabilities like planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, along with their applications in various task domains. It emphasizes reinforcement learning as crucial for transforming static modules into adaptive agentic behavior. The article consolidates open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks for researchers. By analyzing over five hundred recent works, it maps the evolving field of Agentic RL and identifies opportunities and challenges for developing scalable AI agents. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.

<div> framework, wireless sensing, security, zero-knowledge proofs, encoder <br />
Summary: <br />
ZK-SenseLM is a wireless sensing framework that ensures security through zero-knowledge proofs and a large-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information. It incorporates mmWave radar or RFID and a policy-based decision layer. The system utilizes masked spectral pretraining and phase-consistency regularization for encoding, with a cross-modal alignment linking RF features to policy tokens. To prevent unsafe actions during distribution shift, a selective-abstention head is employed, with the chosen risk-coverage point included in the proof. A four-stage proving pipeline ensures the integrity of actions, with PLONK-style proofs verifying actions and confidence. Proofs are optimized using micro-batching and can be offloaded from low-power devices through a gateway option. The system is compatible with federated learning and on-device personalization while maintaining verifiability. ZK-SenseLM enhances performance in various tasks, improves calibration and coverage-risk curves, and effectively detects tampering and replay events. <div>

Abstract: ZK-SenseLM is a secure and auditable wireless sensing framework that pairs a large-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information (and optionally mmWave radar or RFID) with a policy-grounded decision layer and end-to-end zero-knowledge proofs of inference. The encoder uses masked spectral pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal alignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens. To reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated selective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is registered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving pipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version binding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the quantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and confidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a gateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates with differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization without weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are part of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion, respiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1 and calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and rejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.

Abstract: Existing speech models suffer from competing requirements on token representations by understanding and generation tasks. This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation.

Summary:
The paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a framework for extracting memorized data from large language models (LLMs) by maximizing model uncertainty. It identifies a spike in token-level prediction entropy as a precursor to the emission of memorized text during divergence, and leverages this insight to optimize input snippets for inducing a high-entropy state. The proposed Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) weakens alignment in aligned LLMs to increase susceptibility to attacks. Experimental results show that CIA outperforms existing methods in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without prior knowledge of the training data.

Abstract: The memorization of training data in large language models (LLMs) poses significant privacy and copyright concerns. Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data. Our findings highlight persistent memorization risks across various LLMs and offer a more systematic method for assessing these vulnerabilities.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of harmful online content--e.g., toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment--demands robust and adaptable moderation systems. However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems. To foster reproducibility and facilitate future research, we publicly release our code on GitHub and the annotated Mastodon dataset on Hugging Face.

Summary: <br />
FlowMM is introduced as a framework for multimodal KV cache merging, addressing limitations in traditional eviction strategies. It leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while maintaining contextual integrity. The framework also includes a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism to evaluate token similarity and task sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while preserving high-sensitivity ones. Experimental results across MLLMs demonstrate a significant reduction in KV cache memory and decoding latency while maintaining competitive task performance. <div>

Abstract: Traditional KV cache eviction strategies, which discard less critical KV-pairs based on attention scores, often degrade generation quality, causing context loss or hallucinations. Recent efforts shift toward KV merging, merging eviction tokens with retention tokens based on similarity. However, in multimodal scenarios, distributional biases across modality tokens and attentional biases in cross-modal interactions limit its effectiveness. This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones. Extensive experiments across diverse leading MLLMs show that FlowMM reduces KV cache memory by 80% to 95% and decoding latency by 1.3-1.8x, while maintaining competitive task performance.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models, Diffusion models, Neural architectures, Model Collapse

Summary:
Artificial Intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has significantly impacted various fields such as software engineering, journalism, and academia. The proliferation of AI-generated content is evident, with a high percentage of webpages containing such material. However, the use of synthetic content poses a risk of Model Collapse due to reduced linguistic and semantic diversity. This study explores the onset of collapse by analyzing semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia from 2013 to 2025. Results indicate a gradual increase in similarity before the adoption of LLM models, attributable to early RNN/LSTM technologies. Fluctuations in similarity reflect linguistic diversity, corpus size variations, and sampling error. A sharp rise in similarity post-LLM adoption signifies a potential threat to data richness and model generalization. This data-driven analysis offers insights into the progression towards recursive AI contamination. 

<br /><br />Summary: Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized various domains, with a substantial presence of AI-generated content on webpages. However, the widespread use of synthetic material poses a risk of Model Collapse, impacting linguistic and semantic diversity. By analyzing semantic similarity trends in English-language Wikipedia, this study uncovers an exponential rise in similarity following the adoption of Large Language Models. Fluctuations in similarity metrics highlight linguistic diversity and corpus size variations. The study provides valuable insights into the potential onset of recursive AI contamination, signaling a potential threat to data richness and model generalization. <div>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has transformed domains such as software engineering, journalism, creative writing, academia, and media (Naveed et al. 2025; arXiv:2307.06435). Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization.

<title>Temporal Sparse Autoencoders: Leveraging the Sequential Nature of Language for Interpretability</title>

<div> Keywords: interpretability, Sparse Autoencoders, linguistic understanding, semantic features, unsupervised learning

Summary:<br /><br />Translating complex model representations into human-understandable concepts is a critical goal for interpretability. Current methods like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) often fail to capture meaningful linguistic information, focusing instead on superficial patterns. This stems from a lack of integration of linguistic knowledge in training. To address this, Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs) are introduced, which prioritize semantic over syntactic features through a novel contrastive loss mechanism. The T-SAEs successfully disentangle semantic concepts in a self-supervised manner, yielding smoother and coherent semantic representations across various datasets and models. Surprisingly, these semantic structures emerge without explicit semantic supervision, indicating a promising approach for enhancing unsupervised interpretability in language models. <div>

Abstract: Translating the internal representations and computations of models into concepts that humans can understand is a key goal of interpretability. While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as "the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.

Abstract: We study architectural and optimization tech- niques for sample-efficient language modeling under the constraints of the BabyLM 2025 shared task. Our model, BLaLM, replaces self-attention with a linear-time mLSTM to- ken mixer and explores lightweight enhance- ments, including short convolutions, sliding window attention with dynamic modulation, and Hedgehog feature maps. To support train- ing in low-resource settings, we curate a high- quality corpus emphasizing readability and ped- agogical structure. Experiments across both STRICT and STRICT-SMALL tracks show that (1) linear attention combined with sliding win- dow attention consistently improves zero-shot performance, and (2) the Muon optimizer stabi- lizes convergence and reduces perplexity over AdamW. These results highlight effective strate- gies for efficient language modeling without relying on scale.

<div> tokenization, subword, language model, UTF-8, monoid theory

Summary:
This paper discusses the challenges of subword tokenization for language models, specifically focusing on the trade-offs between using code points and bytes in the vocabulary. By formalizing tokenization using monoid theory, the study proves that tokenizers with ill-formed UTF-8 tokens can result in sequences that are also ill-formed UTF-8. The research demonstrates the implications of converting tokens incrementally versus all at once, highlighting potential differences in results. Real-world bugs resulting from these issues are discussed, along with evaluations of mitigations. Case studies involving major foundation models, serving engines, and constrained generation systems are explored to showcase the impact of these findings. The study emphasizes the need for applications of language models to account for potential breakage introduced by using byte-based vocabularies. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subword tokenization segments input text according to a pre-defined vocabulary to feed it into a language model; the language model, in turn, generates a sequence made from this same vocabulary. The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once. This formal result predicts real-world bugs: we evaluate mitigations for the problem identified and provide case studies of major foundation models, serving engines, and constrained generation systems.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, model collaboration, diversity, quality, inference-time

Summary: 
Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo) is introduced as a framework for improving the diversity and quality of large language models (LLMs) by dynamically combining a base model with its aligned counterpart. Utilizing routing strategies based on next-token prediction uncertainty and semantic role prediction, BACo optimizes diversity and quality without compromising on performance. Compared to existing diversity-promoting methods, BACo achieves a balance between diversity and quality in a single pass, offering controllability and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across various generation tasks and metrics. Through collaboration between base and aligned models, BACo demonstrates a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality, as confirmed by human evaluations. This approach highlights the potential of model collaboration to enhance the output quality of LLMs while maintaining diversity. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment has greatly improved large language models (LLMs)' output quality at the cost of diversity, yielding highly similar outputs across generations. We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements. The results suggest that collaboration between base and aligned models can optimize and control diversity and quality.

Summary:
Large language models like GPT-4 and Claude 3 have greatly improved automated reasoning and code generation. However, existing benchmarks often overlook token efficiency, which plays a crucial role in determining system latency, cost, and energy consumption. In response to this gap, the OckBench benchmark was introduced to evaluate both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments on various models, it was discovered that models with similar accuracy can differ significantly in token consumption. The benchmark also highlights the importance of considering token efficiency when evaluating models, prompting a paradigm shift in research evaluation practices. OckBench serves as a comprehensive platform for measuring, comparing, and guiding research in token-efficient reasoning. The benchmarks are accessible at https://ockbench.github.io/. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models such as GPT-4, Claude 3, and the Gemini series have improved automated reasoning and code generation. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on accuracy and output quality, and they ignore an important factor: decoding token efficiency. In real systems, generating 10,000 tokens versus 100,000 tokens leads to large differences in latency, cost, and energy. In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as "free" to multiply. OckBench provides a unified platform for measuring, comparing, and guiding research in token-efficient reasoning. Our benchmarks are available at https://ockbench.github.io/ .

Summary: 
The study explores the role of induction heads in transformers, which are attention heads that perform inductive copying to match patterns and copy continuations. The research investigates whether transformers can still acquire in-context learning capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. The proposed Hapax setting omits the loss contribution for tokens predict correctly by induction heads. Despite a reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive in-context learning tasks remains comparable and even surpasses the vanilla model on various tasks. The model achieves lower loss values on token positions not predicted by induction heads. Analysis reveals that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still retain in-context learning capabilities. These findings suggest that inductive copying is not essential for learning abstractive in-context learning mechanisms. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Induction heads are attention heads that perform inductive copying by matching patterns from earlier context and copying their continuations verbatim. As models develop induction heads, they often experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may serve as a prerequisite for more complex in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities. Taken together, our findings indicate that inductive copying is not essential for learning abstractive ICL mechanisms.

Abstract: This study investigates a hybrid method for text classification that integrates deep feature extraction from large language models, multi-scale fusion through feature pyramids, and structured modeling with graph neural networks to enhance performance in complex semantic contexts. First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework. This study not only constructs an integrated framework that balances global and local information as well as semantics and structure, but also provides a new perspective for multi-scale feature fusion and structured semantic modeling in text classification tasks.

- Kleinberg and Mullainathan demonstrated the theoretical possibility of language generation with a sufficient number of positive examples, but practical feasibility is challenging.<br />
- Simple language families like regular and context-free languages may require an extraordinarily large number of examples for successful generation, sometimes without a computable bound.<br />
- There exists a significant gap between the theoretical potential and efficient learnability of language.<br />

arXiv:2511.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan showed that, in principle, language generation is always possible: with sufficiently many positive examples, a learner can eventually produce sentences indistinguishable from those of a target language. However, the existence of such a guarantee does not speak to its practical feasibility. In this work, we show that even for simple and well-studied language families -- such as regular and context-free languages -- the number of examples required for successful generation can be extraordinarily large, and in some cases not bounded by any computable function. These results reveal a substantial gap between theoretical possibility and efficient learnability. They suggest that explaining the empirical success of modern language models requires a refined perspective -- one that takes into account structural properties of natural language that make effective generation possible in practice.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework called DRAGON for unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) to protect private data and remove harmful knowledge. DRAGON leverages in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guide LLMs without the need for access to retain data. By utilizing a lightweight detection module and a CoT guard model, DRAGON can effectively identify forget-worthy prompts and enforce safe intervention without modifying the base model. The framework is evaluated across three unlearning tasks, demonstrating its strong capability, scalability, and practical applicability. The proposed metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting provide a robust evaluation of DRAGON's effectiveness in data-limited scenarios. Overall, DRAGON offers a promising solution for efficient and secure unlearning in LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for protecting private data and removing harmful knowledge. Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios.

<div> knowledge editing, fine-tuning, language models, edits decay, selective-layer fine-tuning

Summary:
In this study, the authors explore the interaction between knowledge editing and fine-tuning in large language models (LLMs). They investigate whether edits made to LLMs persist after fine-tuning, which is crucial for scenarios such as removing malicious edits or preserving beneficial ones. The experiments involve testing two editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets. The results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with the survival of edits varying across configurations. Selective-layer fine-tuning is proposed as a strategy to effectively remove edits, even though it may slightly impact downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. This study establishes empirical baselines and provides actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning in LLMs, emphasizing the importance of considering the full application pipeline when evaluating model editing. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as a lightweight alternative to retraining for correcting or injecting specific facts in large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown value in the medical field, but there are limitations. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies have potential to enhance clinical applicability. However, current research relies heavily on publicly available data, with limited use of private data. Retrieval approaches commonly use English-centric embedding models, while medical-specific LLMs are underutilized. Evaluation metrics focus on generation quality and task performance, but lack attention to bias and safety. RAG applications in medicine are concentrated on question answering, report generation, text summarization, and information extraction. The field of medical RAG is still in its early stages and requires advancements in clinical validation, cross-linguistic adaptation, and support for low-resource settings to ensure global use is trustworthy and responsible.

We found that research primarily relied on publicly available data, with limited application in private data. For retrieval, approaches commonly relied on English-centric embedding models, while LLMs were mostly generic, with limited use of medical-specific LLMs. For evaluation, automated metrics evaluated generation quality and task performance, whereas human evaluation focused on accuracy, completeness, relevance, and fluency, with insufficient attention to bias and safety. RAG applications were concentrated on question answering, report generation, text summarization, and information extraction. Overall, medical RAG remains at an early stage, requiring advances in clinical validation, cross-linguistic adaptation, and support for low-resource settings to enable trustworthy and responsible global use.

<div> Keywords: New Intent Discovery, Clustering, Language Models, Semi-Supervised Learning, Text Embeddings <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel clustering framework, NILC, designed for effective New Intent Discovery (NID) in dialogue systems. Existing NID approaches typically use a cascaded architecture, but NILC adopts an iterative workflow to leverage feedback from both text embeddings and clustering stages. By incorporating large language models (LLMs), NILC enriches cluster centroids with contextual semantics and refines uncertain utterances for improved clustering. It also utilizes LLMs to rewrite and correct ambiguous or terse utterances, enhancing the performance of NID. In the semi-supervised setting, NILC employs non-trivial techniques such as seeding and soft must links to provide supervision signals for more accurate intent recognition. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of NILC over recent baselines across various datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving significant improvements in NID tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: New intent discovery (NID) seeks to recognize both new and known intents from unlabeled user utterances, which finds prevalent use in practical dialogue systems. Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments comparing NILC against multiple recent baselines under both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings showcase that NILC can achieve significant performance improvements over six benchmark datasets of diverse domains consistently.

<div> Keywords: Voice-controlled dialog systems, Intent Detection, Active Learning, Semi-supervised learning, Annotation cost reduction

Summary:
IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction) is introduced as a semi-supervised framework for voice-controlled dialog systems. It aims to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing human annotation. The framework surpasses baseline methods, achieving higher accuracy and macro-F1 improvement. Empirical findings on benchmark datasets show 5-10% higher accuracy and 4-8% improvement in macro-F1 compared to baseline methods. Notably, IDALC maintains the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available. The framework can efficiently retrain agents with new intents from rejected queries over time, reducing the need for manual annotation. IDALC presents a cost-effective solution for improving the performance of voice-controlled dialog systems while minimizing human effort in annotation tasks.<br /><br />Summary: IDALC is a semi-supervised framework that detects intents and corrects rejected utterances in voice-controlled systems, achieving higher accuracy and macro-F1 improvement while minimizing annotation costs and manual effort. <div>

Abstract: Voice-controlled dialog systems have become immensely popular due to their ability to perform a wide range of actions in response to diverse user queries. These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system. The overall framework of IDALC is shown in Fig. 1

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, language model, hierarchical knowledge, structured prompting, internal activation analysis

Summary:
Reinforcement learning (RL) enhances language models' performance in recalling pure knowledge, especially in structured knowledge tasks like medical codes. The study shows that RL models outperform base and supervised fine-tuned models in recalling procedural paths within existing knowledge hierarchies. Structured prompting helps fine-tuned models bridge the performance gap, indicating that RL models excel in navigating knowledge hierarchies. While final-answer accuracy improves with prompting, RL models retain superior procedural path recall abilities. Internal activation analysis reveals that RL transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than knowledge representation itself. Factual representations maintain similarity between fine-tuned and RL models, but query representations diverge, highlighting RL's impact on knowledge traversal. This study challenges the notion that RL degrades memorized knowledge, instead showing its effectiveness in enhancing procedural skills in structured knowledge recall tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is often credited with improving language model reasoning and generalization at the expense of degrading memorized knowledge. We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement "code 57.95 refers to urinary infection") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., "what is code 57.95") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards, language models, entropy dynamics, calibration

Summary: 
Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been used to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the collapse of entropy during RLVR training can lead to suboptimal convergence and hinder performance improvement. A comprehensive study on entropy dynamics in RLVR is lacking, prompting extensive experiments to be conducted. Factors such as off-policy updates, data diversity, and clipping thresholds impact model entropy. Tokens with positive advantages contribute most to entropy collapse, and adjusting loss weights of tokens can regulate model entropy effectively. The study reveals a correlation between model entropy, response diversity, calibration, and performance in various benchmarks. This research provides valuable insights into improving RLVR training of LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a predominant approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the entropy of LLMs usually collapses during RLVR training, causing premature convergence to suboptimal local minima and hinder further performance improvement. Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that tokens with positive advantages are the primary contributors to entropy collapse, and that model entropy can be effectively regulated by adjusting the relative loss weights of tokens with positive and negative advantages during training.

Summary:
The study evaluates the retention of age-related information by state-of-the-art language models in generating abstractive summaries of biomedical studies. A novel age-stratified dataset, DemogSummary, is created to assess demographic distinctions in child, adult, and older adult populations. Three LLMs - Qwen, Longformer, and GPT-4.1 Nano - are evaluated using standard metrics and a new Demographic Salience Score. It is found that adult-focused summaries have the lowest demographic fidelity, and under-represented populations are more susceptible to hallucinations. The study highlights the limitations of current LLMs in maintaining faithful and unbiased summarization, emphasizing the necessity for fairness-aware evaluation frameworks and summarization pipelines in biomedical NLP.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.06000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical interventions often hinge on age: medications and procedures safe for adults may be harmful to children or ineffective for older adults. However, as language models are increasingly integrated into biomedical evidence synthesis workflows, it remains uncertain whether these systems preserve such crucial demographic distinctions. To address this gap, we evaluate how well state-of-the-art language models retain age-related information when generating abstractive summaries of biomedical studies. We construct DemogSummary, a novel age-stratified dataset of systematic review primary studies, covering child, adult, and older adult populations. We evaluate three prominent summarisation-capable LLMs, Qwen (open-source), Longformer (open-source) and GPT-4.1 Nano (proprietary), using both standard metrics and a newly proposed Demographic Salience Score (DSS), which quantifies age-related entity retention and hallucination. Our results reveal systematic disparities across models and age groups: demographic fidelity is lowest for adult-focused summaries, and under-represented populations are more prone to hallucinations. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in faithful and bias-free summarisation and point to the need for fairness-aware evaluation frameworks and summarisation pipelines in biomedical NLP.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Implicit biases, Discrimination, Multi-dimensional, De-biasing

Summary:
This paper introduces a Multi-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to address the implicit biases and discriminatory tendencies found in Large Language Models (LLMs). By creating a synthetic dataset based on Chinese-context discrimination categories and training a reward model with multi-dimensional signals, the GRPO fine-tunes LLMs to optimize ethical dimensions such as fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. Experimental results show a significant reduction in bias intensity and an improvement in alignment with non-discriminatory standards while maintaining fluency and informativeness. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of GRPO-based multi-reward optimization for de-biasing LLMs, providing a replicable framework for cultural-contextual ethical alignment.

arXiv:2511.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit implicit biases and discriminatory tendencies that reflect underlying social stereotypes. While recent alignment techniques such as RLHF and DPO have mitigated some of these issues, they remain limited in addressing culturally specific and multi-dimensional forms of discrimination. This paper proposes a Multi-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to fine-tune LLMs toward ethical and bias-free behavior. Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. The trained reward model then guides GRPO fine-tuning to optimize model outputs along these ethical dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in bias intensity and improved alignment with non-discriminatory standards without compromising fluency or informativeness. This study highlights the effectiveness of GRPO-based multi-reward optimization for de-biasing LLMs and offers a replicable framework for cultural-contextual ethical alignment.

Summary:
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a valuable tool for interpreting features in large language models by learning sparse directions. However, the vast number of extracted directions presents challenges for comprehensive exploration. Conventional embedding techniques like UMAP have limitations that can hinder accurate representation of global structure. In response, a focused exploration framework is proposed in this work, prioritizing curated concepts and their associated SAE features instead of attempting to visualize all features at once. An interactive visualization system combines topology-based visual encoding with dimensionality reduction, allowing users to examine both local and global relationships within selected features. This hybrid approach enhances understanding of SAE behavior through targeted and interpretable subsets, enabling deeper analysis of concept representation in latent space. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for uncovering interpretable features in large language models (LLMs) through the sparse directions they learn. However, the sheer number of extracted directions makes comprehensive exploration intractable. While conventional embedding techniques such as UMAP can reveal global structure, they suffer from limitations including high-dimensional compression artifacts, overplotting, and misleading neighborhood distortions. In this work, we propose a focused exploration framework that prioritizes curated concepts and their corresponding SAE features over attempts to visualize all available features simultaneously. We present an interactive visualization system that combines topology-based visual encoding with dimensionality reduction to faithfully represent both local and global relationships among selected features. This hybrid approach enables users to investigate SAE behavior through targeted, interpretable subsets, facilitating deeper and more nuanced analysis of concept representation in latent space.

Efficient hate speech detection systems are crucial for real-time deployment. A three-layer framework is proposed, combining rule-based pre-filtering with a parameter-efficient LoRA-tuned BERTweet model and continuous learning capabilities. This approach achieves a 0.85 macro F1 score, comparable to state-of-the-art large language models like SafePhi but with a base model 100 times smaller. Dataset unification and optimized fine-tuning contribute to superior performance compared to traditional BERT-based methods with similar computational requirements.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces ReMoD, a framework for multimodal stance detection that incorporates dual-reasoning mechanisms. By combining intuitive reasoning with reflective reasoning, ReMoD dynamically weights the contribution of different modalities based on their expressive power. The intuitive stage utilizes experience pools to form an initial stance hypothesis, while the reflective stage refines this hypothesis by adjusting for modality biases and incorporating deeper semantic insights. Through continuous refinement during training and inference, ReMoD guides robust and context-aware stance decisions. Experimental results on the MMSD benchmark show that ReMoD outperforms baseline models and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2511.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Stance Detection (MSD) is a crucial task for understanding public opinion on social media. Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions. Extensive experiments on the public MMSD benchmark demonstrate that our ReMoD significantly outperforms most baseline models and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

ArchCraft generates RTL and testbench code, facilitating verification and debugging to report Power, Area, and Performance metrics. The proposed benchmark ArchSynthBench provides a comprehensive evaluation of hardware synthesis from architectural descriptions. Experimental results showcase the superiority of ArchCraft over direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in paper understanding and code completion.

Abstract: The reproduction of hardware architectures from academic papers remains a significant challenge due to the lack of publicly available source code and the complexity of hardware description languages (HDLs). To this end, we propose \textbf{ArchCraft}, a Framework that converts abstract architectural descriptions from academic papers into synthesizable Verilog projects with register-transfer level (RTL) verification. ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA). Moreover, we propose the first benchmark, \textbf{ArchSynthBench}, for synthesizing hardware from architectural descriptions, with a complete set of evaluation indicators, 50 project-level circuits, and around 600 circuit blocks. We systematically assess ArchCraft on ArchSynthBench, where the experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, surpassing direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in both paper understanding and code completion. Furthermore, evaluation and physical implementation of the generated executable RTL code show that these implementations meet all timing constraints without violations, and their performance metrics are consistent with those reported in the original papers.

Summary: <br />
- The study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution, to prevent hallucinations in language models by validating against structured knowledge graphs.
- Unlike other methods, the Licensing Oracle integrates deterministic validation to ensure only factually accurate information is generated.
- Experiments comparing the Licensing Oracle with various methods showed it achieved perfect abstention precision and zero false answers, with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses.
- While methods like retrieval-augmented generation and fine-tuning improve performance, they do not eliminate hallucinations.

arXiv:2511.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models exhibit remarkable natural language generation capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect information despite producing syntactically coherent responses. This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match. Although the Licensing Oracle is specifically designed to address hallucinations in fact-based domains, its framework lays the groundwork for truth-constrained generation in future AI systems, providing a new path toward reliable, epistemically grounded models.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as a solution for grounded QA in both academia and industry, current RAG methods struggle with questions where the necessary information is distributed across many documents or where retrieval needs to be combined with complex reasoning. Recently, the LOFT study has shown that this limitation also applies to approaches based on long-context language models, with the QUEST benchmark exhibiting particularly large headroom. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the factors contributing to the poor performance on QUEST-LOFT, publish updated numbers based on a thorough human evaluation, and demonstrate that RAG can be optimized to significantly outperform long-context approaches when combined with a structured output format containing reasoning and evidence, optionally followed by answer re-verification.

<div> Keywords: Spatial Reasoning, Vision-language models, Referring Expression Comprehension, Ambiguity, Negation

Summary:
Spatial Reasoning plays a crucial role in human cognition, challenging the latest Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Traditional analysis focuses on image captioning and visual question answering, but this study suggests using the Referring Expression Comprehension task to evaluate VLMs' spatial reasoning. This task reveals VLMs' performance in detecting ambiguous objects, understanding complex spatial expressions, and handling negation. By comparing task-specific architectures and large VLMs, the study exposes the strengths and weaknesses of these models in various spatial semantics categories. Despite facing difficulties in the task, the models exhibit different behaviors based on their underlying structures. This research sheds light on existing challenges and opportunities for future studies in enhancing VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Spatial Reasoning is essential for human cognition and poses challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
- Referring Expression Comprehension task is proposed as an evaluation platform to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning abilities.
- The task highlights challenges in object detection ambiguity, complex spatial expressions, and negation understanding.
- Comparison of task-specific architectures and large VLMs exposes strengths and weaknesses in handling various spatial semantics categories.

Abstract: Spatial Reasoning is an important component of human cognition and is an area in which the latest Vision-language models (VLMs) show signs of difficulty. The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.

Summary: Aspect-based summarization for books is challenging due to the lack of reference summaries for long texts. To address this, BookAsSumQA introduces a QA-based evaluation framework that generates aspect-specific QA pairs from a narrative knowledge graph to evaluate summarization quality based on question-answering performance. Experimental results using BookAsSumQA indicate that LLM-based approaches exhibit higher accuracy on shorter texts, while RAG-based methods are more effective for longer documents, making them more practical for aspect-based book summarization. This framework allows for more personalized and targeted summaries by highlighting specific aspects of the text. <div>

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries that highlight specific aspects of a text, enabling more personalized and targeted summaries. However, its application to books remains unexplored due to the difficulty of constructing reference summaries for long text. To address this challenge, we propose BookAsSumQA, a QA-based evaluation framework for aspect-based book summarization. BookAsSumQA automatically generates aspect-specific QA pairs from a narrative knowledge graph to evaluate summary quality based on its question-answering performance. Our experiments using BookAsSumQA revealed that while LLM-based approaches showed higher accuracy on shorter texts, RAG-based methods become more effective as document length increases, making them more efficient and practical for aspect-based book summarization.

<div> framework, routing, Large Language Models, inference costs, confidence scores<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces STEER, a domain-agnostic framework for cost-efficient reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging confidence scores from smaller models, STEER performs step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs to reduce inference costs. Unlike existing methods, STEER does not rely on external models for routing and achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy across diverse benchmarks such as Mathematical Reasoning and Planning tasks. By utilizing model-internal confidence as a robust signal for routing, STEER offers a scalable approach for efficient deployment of LLMs. This approach helps to reduce inference costs by up to 48% while maintaining similar or improved accuracy compared to solely using larger models, showcasing the effectiveness of model-internal confidence in guiding efficient reasoning in LLMs. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) - particularly model scaling and test-time techniques - have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of language models at the expense of higher inference costs. To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules. Our results establish model-internal confidence as a robust, domain-agnostic signal for model routing, offering a scalable pathway for efficient LLM deployment.

Summary:
Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL) is proposed as a framework to enhance Alzheimer's Disease detection using narrative transcripts. It integrates structured explicit knowledge to improve reasoning stability and task alignment in large language models (LLMs) under out-of-distribution and data-scarce conditions. EK-ICL incorporates confidence scores from small language models to ground predictions, parsing feature scores for improved demonstration selection, and label word replacement to address semantic misalignment. A parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction are used to handle semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments showed that EK-ICL outperforms current fine-tuning and in-context learning approaches in AD detection. The study highlights the significance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning, emphasizing the importance of aligning label semantics with task context for optimal performance in low-resource settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from narrative transcripts remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), particularly under out-of-distribution (OOD) and data-scarce conditions. While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a new alignment paradigm called priority alignment, focusing on ensuring trustworthiness before helpfulness in language model applications for high-stakes scenarios. It presents Self-Priority Alignment (SPA), an unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, evaluates them, and refines them to meet trustworthy thresholds. SPA uses dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistencies and control variance, constructing preference pairs and fine-tuning the model with an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that SPA improves helpfulness while maintaining safety, outperforming strong baselines and preserving general capabilities. The approach provides a scalable and interpretable strategy for aligning language models in critical applications.

Abstract: In high-stakes scenarios-such as self-harm, legal, or medical queries-LLMs must be both trustworthy and helpful. However, these goals often conflict. We propose priority alignment, a new alignment paradigm that enforces a strict "trustworthy-before-helpful" ordering: optimization of helpfulness is conditioned on first meeting trustworthy thresholds (e.g., harmlessness or honesty). To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SPA improves helpfulness without compromising safety, outperforming strong baselines while preserving general capabilities. Our results demonstrate that SPA provides a scalable and interpretable alignment strategy for critical LLM applications.

Abstract: Discharge medication recommendation plays a critical role in ensuring treatment continuity, preventing readmission, and improving long-term management for patients with chronic metabolic diseases. This paper present an overview of the CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2 competition, which aimed to develop state-of-the-art approaches for automatically recommending appro-priate discharge medications using real-world Chinese EHR data. For this task, we constructed CDrugRed, a high-quality dataset consisting of 5,894 de-identified hospitalization records from 3,190 patients in China. This task is challenging due to multi-label nature of medication recommendation, het-erogeneous clinical text, and patient-specific variability in treatment plans. A total of 526 teams registered, with 167 and 95 teams submitting valid results to the Phase A and Phase B leaderboards, respectively. The top-performing team achieved the highest overall performance on the final test set, with a Jaccard score of 0.5102, F1 score of 0.6267, demonstrating the potential of advanced large language model (LLM)-based ensemble systems. These re-sults highlight both the promise and remaining challenges of applying LLMs to medication recommendation in Chinese EHRs. The post-evaluation phase remains open at https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/532411/.

Summary:  
- Pre-trained models for natural language inference lack understanding of language nuances like negation, relying on dataset artifacts for high performance.  
- An investigation into an ELECTRA-small model fine-tuned on the SNLI dataset revealed struggles in accurately classifying negation-containing examples.  
- To address this issue, training data was augmented with contrast sets and adversarial examples emphasizing negation.  
- Results showed that this targeted data augmentation improved the model's accuracy on negation-containing examples without compromising overall performance.  
- The identified dataset artifact of the model's struggle with negation was successfully mitigated through the data augmentation technique.  

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained models for natural language inference (NLI) often achieve high performance on benchmark datasets by using spurious correlations, or dataset artifacts, rather than understanding language touches such as negation. In this project, we investigate the performance of an ELECTRA-small model fine-tuned on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, focusing on its handling of negation. Through analysis, we identify that the model struggles with correctly classifying examples containing negation. To address this, we augment the training data with contrast sets and adversarial examples emphasizing negation. Our results demonstrate that this targeted data augmentation improves the model's accuracy on negation-containing examples without adversely affecting overall performance, therefore mitigating the identified dataset artifact.

Summary:
The study introduces the EvalTS benchmark consisting of 10 tasks to evaluate models incorporating text and temporal data. It addresses the issue of models biased towards textual cues by proposing TimeSense, a multimodal framework. TimeSense includes a Temporal Sense module to ground textual reasoning in time-series dynamics and uses coordinate-based positional embeddings for spatial understanding of time-series data. Experimental results show that TimeSense outperforms existing methods on complex multi-dimensional time-series reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks. The framework balances textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense, enhancing the model's ability to analyze time-series data effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the time-series domain, an increasing number of works combine text with temporal data to leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for various downstream time-series understanding tasks. This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeSense achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, and it particularly outperforms existing methods on complex multi-dimensional time-series reasoning tasks.

Summary:<br />
This study examines the optimization of offensive content moderation models for different types of hateful messages. While existing benchmarks focus on explicit hate toward protected groups, implicit hate, including demeaning comparisons and subtle discriminatory language, is often overlooked. The researchers propose using HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models, to enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate with as few as 50 examples per class. They demonstrate that these prototypes facilitate efficient hate speech detection without the need for repeated fine-tuning. Additionally, parameter-free early exiting with prototypes proves effective for both explicit and implicit hate. The code, prototype resources, and evaluation scripts have been released to support future research on efficient and transferable hate speech detection.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization of offensive content moderation models for different types of hateful messages is typically achieved through continued pre-training or fine-tuning on new hate speech benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks. Moreover, we show that parameter-free early exiting with prototypes is effective for both hate types. We release the code, prototype resources, and evaluation scripts to support future research on efficient and transferable hate speech detection.

Abstract: Sugar dating-related content has rapidly proliferated on mainstream social media platforms, giving rise to serious societal and regulatory concerns, including commercialization of intimate relationships and the normalization of transactional relationships.~Detecting such content is highly challenging due to the prevalence of subtle euphemisms, ambiguous linguistic cues, and extreme class imbalance in real-world data.~In this work, we present SugarTextNet, a novel transformer-based framework specifically designed to identify sugar dating-related posts on social media.~SugarTextNet integrates a pretrained transformer encoder, an attention-based cue extractor, and a contextual phrase encoder to capture both salient and nuanced features in user-generated text.~To address class imbalance and enhance minority-class detection, we introduce Context-Aware Focal Loss, a tailored loss function that combines focal loss scaling with contextual weighting.~We evaluate SugarTextNet on a newly curated, manually annotated dataset of 3,067 Chinese social media posts from Sina Weibo, demonstrating that our approach substantially outperforms traditional machine learning models, deep learning baselines, and large language models across multiple metrics.~Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the indispensable role of each component.~Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific, context-aware modeling for sensitive content detection, and provide a robust solution for content moderation in complex, real-world scenarios.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly utilized in the fields of drug development and personalized medicine. A new dataset has been introduced to evaluate LLMs on their factual knowledge of drug mechanisms and their ability to reason about them in novel situations, presented as counterfactuals. Results show that the o4-mini model performs better than other models from OpenAI, with the Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matching its performance. The open-world setting for reasoning tasks, where models must recall relevant knowledge, proves to be more challenging than the closed-world setting. Additionally, counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain are more difficult than those affecting links from the drug mentioned in the prompt. Overall, these findings suggest the importance of LLMs in drug development and personalized medicine, highlighting the need for models to demonstrate factual knowledge and deep understanding of drug mechanisms. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two scientific fields showing increasing interest in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are drug development / repurposing, and personalized medicine. For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt.

Abstract: Metaphors and metaphorical language (MLs) play an important role in healthcare communication between clinicians, patients, and patients' family members. In this work, we focus on Dutch language data from cancer patients. We extract metaphors used by patients using two data sources: (1) cancer patient storytelling interview data and (2) online forum data, including patients' posts, comments, and questions to professionals. We investigate how current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) perform on this task by exploring different prompting strategies such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting. With a human-in-the-loop setup, we verify the extracted metaphors and compile the outputs into a corpus named HealthQuote.NL. We believe the extracted metaphors can support better patient care, for example shared decision making, improved communication between patients and clinicians, and enhanced patient health literacy. They can also inform the design of personalized care pathways. We share prompts and related resources at https://github.com/aaronlifenghan/HealthQuote.NL

Summary: 
AI models are evolving beyond text and increasingly powering vision, audio, and document understanding. While large language models (LLMs) are effective, their high inference costs present challenges for real-time deployment. In contrast, smaller open-source models offer cost advantages but struggle with complex or multimodal queries. To address this, a unified framework has been introduced that intelligently routes queries to the most suitable expert model using a learned routing network. For vision tasks, a two-stage open-source pipeline is employed, optimized for efficiency by incorporating efficient classical vision components where they excel. Performance on benchmarks such as MMLU and VQA matches or exceeds monolithic LLM systems while reducing reliance on costly models by over 67%. The framework's extensible, multi-agent orchestration enables the delivery of high-quality, resource-efficient AI at scale.

We introduce a unified, modular framework that intelligently routes each query - textual, multimodal, or complex - to the most fitting expert model, using a learned routing network that balances cost and quality. For vision tasks, we employ a two-stage open-source pipeline optimized for efficiency and reviving efficient classical vision components where they remain SOTA for sub-tasks. On benchmarks such as Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) and Visual Question Answering (VQA), we match or exceed the performance of always-premium LLM (monolithic systems with one model serving all query types) performance, yet reduce the reliance on costly models by over 67%. With its extensible, multi-agent orchestration, we deliver high-quality, resource-efficient AI at scale.

<div> knowledge bases, language models, retrieval, structured knowledge, attention<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces SR-KI, a novel approach for integrating real-time and large-scale structured knowledge bases into large language models. SR-KI encodes KBs into key-value pairs and injects them into LLMs' KV cache for efficient retrieval. It employs a two-stage training paradigm, incorporating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM and applying an attention-based loss for supervision. Unlike traditional methods, SR-KI performs retrieval entirely within the model's latent space, allowing for dynamic knowledge updates. Experimental results show that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM while maintaining strong retrieval performance. It achieves high Recall@10 rates and up to 99.75% compression of injected KBs, demonstrating its effectiveness in question answering and KB ID generation tasks. <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes SR-KI, a novel approach for integrating real-time and large-scale structured knowledge bases (KBs) into large language models (LLMs). SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks. Task performance on question answering and KB ID generation also demonstrates that SR-KI maintains strong performance while achieving up to 99.75% compression of the injected KBs.

<br />
Summary: Realignment is a promising strategy for improving cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models. However, its effectiveness varies, especially for low-resource languages (LRLs). This study explores whether using strategically selected language subsets can provide comparable or even superior results compared to full multilingual alignment. The experiments show that realignment can greatly benefit LRLs and that carefully chosen language subsets can match or even outperform full alignment, particularly for unseen LRLs. This suggests that realignment does not always require all available languages, reducing the need for extensive data collection. Strategic language selection can lead to efficient and robust realignment, offering a more feasible approach for enhancing cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Realignment is a promising strategy to improve cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models. However, empirical results are mixed and often unreliable, particularly for typologically distant or low-resource languages (LRLs) compared to English. Moreover, word realignment tools often rely on high-quality parallel data, which can be scarce or noisy for many LRLs. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown excellent performance on various tasks, but their large size can lead to inefficiencies in memory and latency for applications requiring limited capabilities. This work introduces two new task-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) methods, Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ) and TAQO, which leverage task-specific signals encoded in hidden representations to guide the quantization process. By identifying task-relevant layers and preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing others, TAQ and TAQO achieve stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Experimental results demonstrate that TAQ and TAQO outperform existing baselines on various models, with TAQ leading on Phi-4 and TAQO leading on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5. For example, TAQ achieves significantly higher accuracy on Phi-4 compared to Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), while maintaining performance close to the original accuracy at lower average precision levels. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks, yet many applications require only limited capabilities, making large variants inefficient in memory and latency. Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest. This yields stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Across models, TAQ and TAQO outperform the baselines; TAQ leads on Phi-4, while TAQO leads on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5. For instances, on Phi-4 it achieves 42.33 EM / 50.81 F1, far surpassing Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) (2.25 / 7.07), while remaining within < 1.0% of the original accuracy at lower average precision.

<div> Framework, Question-Answer, Data refinement, Large Language Models, Dataset quality  
Summary:  
RefineLab is a novel framework that uses Large Language Models to automatically refine Question-Answer datasets, addressing quality issues such as domain coverage gaps, difficulty imbalances, and factual inconsistencies. By setting target quality attributes and a token budget constraint, RefineLab performs selective edits on the dataset to improve overall quality while being resource-efficient. The framework operates as a constrained optimization problem, selecting optimal refinement strategies such as rephrasing or distractor replacement for each QA sample. Experimental results show that RefineLab significantly enhances dataset quality in terms of coverage, difficulty alignment, factual fidelity, and distractor quality, reducing discrepancies from expert-crafted datasets. This approach offers a scalable and customizable solution for reproducible dataset design, with implications for improving Large Language Model evaluation.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality Question-Answer (QA) datasets are foundational for reliable Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, yet even expert-crafted datasets exhibit persistent gaps in domain coverage, misaligned difficulty distributions, and factual inconsistencies. The recent surge in generative model-powered datasets has compounded these quality challenges. In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint. Experiments demonstrate that RefineLab consistently narrows divergence from expert datasets across coverage, difficulty alignment, factual fidelity, and distractor quality. RefineLab pioneers a scalable, customizable path to reproducible dataset design, with broad implications for LLM evaluation.

Summary: 
- Nigeria, with over 200 million people and 500 languages, lacks NLP research in languages beyond Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yoruba.
- A new dataset, ibom, introduces Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro languages for machine translation and topic classification.
- These languages are not represented in major benchmarks like Google Translate or Flores-200, highlighting the need for their inclusion.
- Evaluation shows current language models perform poorly in machine translation for these languages but improve steadily in topic classification with more shots.

Abstract: Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with a population of more than 200 million people. More than 500 languages are spoken in Nigeria and it is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world. Despite this, natural language processing (NLP) research has mostly focused on the following four languages: Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yoruba (i.e <1% of the languages spoken in Nigeria). This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200. We focus on extending Flores-200 benchmark to these languages, and further align the translated texts with topic labels based on SIB-200 classification dataset. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs perform poorly on machine translation for these languages in both zero-and-few shot settings. However, we find the few-shot samples to steadily improve topic classification with more shots.

Summary:
Rep2Text introduces a new framework for decoding full text from last-token representations in large language models (LLMs). Through a trainable adapter and decoding language model, it can recover over half of the information in 16-token sequences while maintaining semantic integrity. There is an observed information bottleneck effect where longer sequences show decreased token-level recovery but maintain semantic coherence. The framework shows robust generalization to out-of-distribution medical data, indicating its potential applicability across diverse domains. <div>
arXiv:2511.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across diverse tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this work, we address a fundamental question: to what extent can the original input text be recovered from a single last-token representation within an LLM? We propose Rep2Text, a novel framework for decoding full text from last-token representations. Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity. Besides, our framework also demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution medical data.

Abstract: Ingesting data for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves either fine-tuning the embedding model directly on the target corpus or parsing documents for embedding model encoding. The former, while accurate, incurs high computational hardware requirements, while the latter suffers from suboptimal performance when extracting tabular data. In this work, we address the latter by presenting TabRAG, a parsing-based RAG pipeline designed to tackle table-heavy documents via structured language representations. TabRAG outperforms existing popular parsing-based methods for generation and retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/jacobyhsi/TabRAG.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models transition from text-based interfaces to audio interactions in clinical settings, they might introduce new vulnerabilities through paralinguistic cues in audio. We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities. We conclude that bias-aware architectures are essential and urgently needed before the clinical deployment of these models.

<title>Duality-based Mode Operations and Pyramid Multilayer Mapping for Rhetorical Modes</title>

Abstract: Rhetorical modes are useful in both academic and non-academic writing, and can be subjects to be studied within linguistic research and computational modeling. Establishing a conceptual bridge among these domains could enable each to benefit from the others. This paper proposes duality-based mode operations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction and orthogonal dualities) to expand the set of rhetorical modes, introducing generated modes like combination and generalization, thereby enhancing epistemic diversity across multiple applications. It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes. These considerations appear to transform static and non-measurable rhetorical taxonomies into more dynamic and more measurable systems for discourse design. From this work, it would be possible to identify a pathway for future AI systems to operate not only on language tokens but on layered rhetorical reasoning structures, bridging linguistic, pedagogical, academic, and computational research

<title>How AI Fails: An Interactive Pedagogical Tool for Demonstrating Dialectal Bias in Automated Toxicity Models</title>

Abstract: Now that AI-driven moderation has become pervasive in everyday life, we often hear claims that "the AI is biased". While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as "inappropriate" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for "identity hate". Second, I introduce an interactive pedagogical tool that makes these abstract biases tangible. The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled "sensitivity threshold," demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination. This work provides both statistical evidence of disparate impact and a public-facing tool designed to foster critical AI literacy.

<title>Steering LLMs toward Korean Local Speech: Iterative Refinement Framework for Faithful Dialect Translation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard-to-dialect machine translation remains challenging due to a persistent dialect gap in large language models and evaluation distortions inherent in n-gram metrics, which favor source copying over authentic dialect translation. In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions. Our work establishes a robust framework for goal-directed, inclusive dialect translation, providing both rigorous evaluation and critical insights into model performance.

<title>Textual Self-attention Network: Test-Time Preference Optimization through Textual Gradient-based Attention</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities, but aligning their outputs with human preferences typically requires expensive supervised fine-tuning. Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the gaming industry, driven by technological advancements and a burgeoning community, necessitates a deeper understanding of user sentiments, especially as expressed on popular social media platforms like YouTube. This study presents a sentiment analysis on video games based on YouTube comments, aiming to understand user sentiments within the gaming community. Utilizing YouTube API, comments related to various video games were collected and analyzed using the TextBlob sentiment analysis tool. The pre-processed data underwent classification using machine learning algorithms, including Na\"ive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Among these, SVM demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest classification accuracy across different datasets. The analysis spanned multiple popular gaming videos, revealing trends and insights into user preferences and critiques. The findings underscore the importance of advanced sentiment analysis in capturing the nuanced emotions expressed in user comments, providing valuable feedback for game developers to enhance game design and user experience. Future research will focus on integrating more sophisticated natural language processing techniques and exploring additional data sources to further refine sentiment analysis in the gaming domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of medicine, yet two fundamental challenges persist: keeping up with rapidly evolving medical knowledge and providing verifiable, evidence-grounded reasoning. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively. These findings call for re-examining RAG's role in medicine and highlight the importance of stage-aware evaluation and deliberate system design for reliable medical LLM applications.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are increasingly being deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet their behavioral robustness to data contamination during instruction tuning remains poorly understood. We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\textit{capability curse}" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven significant progress in Natural Language Interface to Database (NLIDB). However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised critical privacy and security concerns. During interactions, LLMs may unintentionally expose confidential database contents or be manipulated by attackers to exfiltrate data through seemingly benign queries. While current efforts typically rely on rule-based heuristics or LLM agents to mitigate this leakage risk, these methods still struggle with complex inference-based attacks, suffer from high false positive rates, and often compromise the reliability of SQL queries. To address these challenges, we propose \textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both larger-scale LLMs and ideal-setting baselines, achieving significant security improvements while preserving high utility.WARNING: This work may contain content that is offensive and harmful!

Abstract: Attention is a core component of transformer architecture, whether encoder-only, decoder-only, or encoder-decoder model. However, the standard softmax attention often produces noisy probability distribution, which can impair effective feature selection at every layer of these models, particularly for long contexts. We propose Focal Attention, a simple yet effective modification that sharpens the attention distribution by controlling the softmax temperature, either as a fixed hyperparameter or as a learnable parameter during training. This sharpening enables the model to concentrate on the most relevant tokens while suppressing irrelevant ones. Empirically, Focal Attention scales more favorably than standard transformer with respect to model size, training data, and context length. Across diverse benchmarks, it achieves the same accuracy with up to 42% fewer parameters or 33% less training data. On long-context tasks, it delivers substantial relative improvements ranging from 17% to 82%, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world applications.

<title>Beyond Plain Demos: A Demo-centric Anchoring Paradigm for In-Context Learning in Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>

Abstract: Detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) from narrative transcripts challenges large language models (LLMs): pre-training rarely covers this out-of-distribution task, and all transcript demos describe the same scene, producing highly homogeneous contexts. These factors cripple both the model's built-in task knowledge (\textbf{task cognition}) and its ability to surface subtle, class-discriminative cues (\textbf{contextual perception}). Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce \textbf{DA4ICL}, a demo-centric anchoring framework that jointly expands context width via \emph{\textbf{Diverse and Contrastive Retrieval}} (DCR) and deepens each demo's signal via \emph{\textbf{Projected Vector Anchoring}} (PVA) at every Transformer layer. Across three AD benchmarks, DA4ICL achieves large, stable gains over both ICL and TV baselines, charting a new paradigm for fine-grained, OOD and low-resource LLM adaptation.

<title>CLiFT-ASR: A Cross-Lingual Fine-Tuning Framework for Low-Resource Taiwanese Hokkien Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages such as Taiwanese Hokkien is difficult due to the scarcity of annotated data. However, direct fine-tuning on Han-character transcriptions often fails to capture detailed phonetic and tonal cues, while training only on romanization lacks lexical and syntactic coverage. In addition, prior studies have rarely explored staged strategies that integrate both annotation types. To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures. Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus demonstrate that CLiFT-ASR achieves a 24.88\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared with strong baselines. The results indicate that CLiFT-ASR provides an effective and parameter-efficient solution for Taiwanese Hokkien ASR and that it has potential to benefit other low-resource language scenarios.

Abstract: Most of the Natural Language Processing sys- tems are involved in entity-based processing for several tasks like Information Extraction, Question-Answering, Text-Summarization and so on. A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way.

Abstract: Large Language Models for Simulating Professions (SP-LLMs), particularly as teachers, are pivotal for personalized education. However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in multimodal reasoning and have shown impressive performance on various multimodal benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning.

<title>HLPD: Aligning LLMs to Human Language Preference for Machine-Revised Text Detection</title>

Abstract: To prevent misinformation and social issues arising from trustworthy-looking content generated by LLMs, it is crucial to develop efficient and reliable methods for identifying the source of texts. Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%. Code will be made available at https://github.com/dfq2021/HLPD.

Abstract: Large language models sometimes inadvertently reproduce passages that are copyrighted, exposing downstream applications to legal risk. Most existing studies for inference-time defences focus on surface-level token matching and rely on external blocklists or filters, which add deployment complexity and may overlook semantically paraphrased leakage. In this work, we reframe copyright infringement mitigation as intrinsic semantic-space control and introduce SCOPE, an inference-time method that requires no parameter updates or auxiliary filters. Specifically, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) projects hidden states into a high-dimensional, near-monosemantic space; benefiting from this representation, we identify a copyright-sensitive subspace and clamp its activations during decoding. Experiments on widely recognized benchmarks show that SCOPE mitigates copyright infringement without degrading general utility. Further interpretability analyses confirm that the isolated subspace captures high-level semantics.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand neural networks by identifying which learned features mediate specific behaviors. Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules.
  Across five prompts including classic "capitals" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness. Entity-swap tests reveal a layerwise hierarchy: early-layer features transfer robustly (64% transfer rate, mean layer 6.3), while late-layer Say-X features specialize for output promotion (mean layer 16.4), supporting a backbone-and-specialization view of transformer computation.
  We release code (https://github.com/peppinob-ol/attribution-graph-probing), an interactive demo (https://huggingface.co/spaces/Peppinob/attribution-graph-probing), and minimal artifacts enabling immediate reproduction and community adoption.

Abstract: Large language models have significantly advanced Multilingual Machine Translation (MMT), yet the broad language coverage, consistent translation quality, and English-centric bias remain open challenges. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{LMT}, a suite of \textbf{L}arge-scale \textbf{M}ultilingual \textbf{T}ranslation models centered on both Chinese and English, covering 60 languages and 234 translation directions. During development, we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon of \textbf{directional degeneration}, where symmetric multi-way fine-tuning data overemphasize reverse directions (X $\to$ En/Zh), leading to excessive many-to-one mappings and degraded translation quality. We propose \textbf{Strategic Downsampling}, a simple yet effective method to mitigate this degeneration. In addition, we design \textbf{Parallel Multilingual Prompting (PMP)}, which leverages typologically related auxiliary languages to enhance cross-lingual transfer. Through rigorous data curation and refined adaptation strategies, LMT achieves SOTA performance among models of comparable language coverage, with our 4B model (LMT-60-4B) surpassing the much larger Aya-101-13B and NLLB-54B models by a substantial margin. We release LMT in four sizes (0.6B/1.7B/4B/8B) to catalyze future research and provide strong baselines for inclusive, scalable, and high-quality MMT \footnote{\href{https://github.com/NiuTrans/LMT}{https://github.com/NiuTrans/LMT}}.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our system under the team name BLEU Monday for the English-to-Indic Multimodal Translation Task at WAT 2025. We participate in the text-only translation tasks for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, English-Malayalam, and English-Odia language pairs. We present a two-stage approach that addresses quality issues in the training data through automated error detection and correction, followed by parameter-efficient model fine-tuning.
  Our methodology introduces a vision-augmented judge-corrector pipeline that leverages multimodal language models to systematically identify and correct translation errors in the training data. The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated (poor translation quality). Identified errors are routed to specialized correctors: GPT-4o-mini regenerates captions requiring visual disambiguation, while IndicTrans2 retranslates cases with pure translation quality issues. This automated pipeline processes 28,928 training examples across four languages, correcting an average of 17.1% of captions per language.
  We then apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the IndicTrans2 en-indic 200M distilled model on both original and corrected datasets. Training on corrected data yields consistent improvements, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali on the evaluation set (42.00 -> 43.30) and +0.70 on the challenge set (44.90 -> 45.60), +0.60 for English-Odia on the evaluation set (41.00 -> 41.60), and +0.10 for English-Hindi on the challenge set (53.90 -> 54.00).

<title>Multilingual Lexical Feature Analysis of Spoken Language for Predicting Major Depression Symptom Severity</title>

Abstract: Background: Captured between clinical appointments using mobile devices, spoken language has potential for objective, more regular assessment of symptom severity and earlier detection of relapse in major depressive disorder. However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.
  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.
  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.
  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.
  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.

Abstract: We introduce llama-embed-nemotron-8b, an open-weights text embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Multilingual Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) leaderboard as of October 21, 2025. While recent models show strong performance, their training data or methodologies are often not fully disclosed. We aim to address this by developing a fully open-source model, publicly releasing its weights and detailed ablation studies, and planning to share the curated training datasets. Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging. The llama-embed-nemotron-8b is an instruction-aware model, supporting user-defined instructions to enhance performance for specific use-cases. This combination of top-tier performance, broad applicability, and user-driven flexibility enables it to serve as a universal text embedding solution.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over one-fifth of adults globally, yet detecting such conditions from text remains challenging due to the subtle and varied nature of symptom expression. This study evaluates multiple approaches for mental health detection, comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama and GPT with classical machine learning and transformer-based architectures including BERT, XLNet, and Distil-RoBERTa. Using the DAIC-WOZ dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression, and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score (0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to 0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach (SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models and highlight the value of synthetic data in improving recall and generalization. However, careful calibration is required to prevent precision loss. Overall, this work emphasizes the potential of combining advanced language models and data augmentation to enhance automated mental health assessment from text.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods typically provide minimal sufficient evidence justifying a model decision. However, in many applications this is inadequate. For compliance and cataloging, the full set of contributing features must be identified - complete evidence. We perform a case study on a medical dataset which contains human-annotated complete evidence. We show that individual models typically recover only subsets of complete evidence and that aggregating evidence from several models improves evidence recall from $\sim$0.60 (single best model) to $\sim$0.86 (ensemble). We analyze the recall-precision trade-off, the role of training with evidence, dynamic ensembles with certainty thresholds, and discuss implications.

<title>Aligning Attention with Human Rationales for Self-Explaining Hate Speech Detection</title>

Abstract: The opaque nature of deep learning models presents significant challenges for the ethical deployment of hate speech detection systems. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Rational Attention (SRA), a framework that explicitly aligns model attention with human rationales, improving both interpretability and fairness in hate speech classification. SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics. These findings demonstrate that incorporating human rationales into attention mechanisms can enhance interpretability and faithfulness without compromising fairness.

<title>Importance-Aware Data Selection for Efficient LLM Instruction Tuning</title>

Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in enhancing the performance and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Its success depends not only on the quality of the instruction data but also on the inherent capabilities of the LLM itself. Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV metric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using In-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for enhancing instruction tuning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that selecting only the top 1\% of data based on MIWV can outperform training on the full dataset. Furthermore, this approach extends beyond existing research that focuses on data quality scoring for data selection, offering strong empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method.

While significant progress has been made for English and other high-resource languages, Bengali remains underexplored despite being the world's fourth most spoken language. The lack of large, standardized datasets classifies Bengali as a low-resource language for emotion detection. Existing studies mainly employ classical machine learning models with traditional feature engineering, yielding limited performance. In this paper, we introduce a new Bengali emotion dataset annotated across eight emotion categories and propose two models for automatic emotion detection: (i) a hybrid Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model (EmoBangHybrid) and (ii) an AdaBoost-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) ensemble model (EmoBangEnsemble). Additionally, we evaluate six baseline models with five feature engineering techniques and assess zero-shot and few-shot large language models (LLMs) on the dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark for Bengali emotion detection. Experimental results show that EmoBangH and EmoBangE achieve accuracies of 92.86% and 93.69%, respectively, outperforming existing methods and establishing strong baselines for future research.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) depends heavily on the quality and scale of their pre-training datasets. Recent research shows that large multimodal models trained on natural documents where images and text are interleaved outperform those trained only on image-text pairs across a wide range of benchmarks, leveraging advanced pre- trained models to enforce semantic alignment, image-sequence consistency, and textual coherence. For Arabic, however, the lack of high-quality multimodal datasets that preserve document structure has limited progress. In this paper, we present our pipeline Wasm for processing the Common Crawl dataset to create a new Arabic multimodal dataset that uniquely provides markdown output. Unlike existing Arabic corpora that focus solely on text extraction, our approach preserves the structural integrity of web content while maintaining flexibility for both text-only and multimodal pre-training scenarios. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of our data processing pipeline against those used for major existing datasets, highlighting the convergences in filtering strategies and justifying our specific design choices. To support future research, we publicly release a representative dataset dump along with the multimodal processing pipeline for Arabic.

<title>More Agents Helps but Adversarial Robustness Gap Persists</title>

Abstract: When LLM agents work together, they seem to be more powerful than a single LLM in mathematical question answering. However, are they also more robust to adversarial inputs? We investigate this question using adversarially perturbed math questions. These perturbations include punctuation noise with three intensities (10, 30, and 50 percent), plus real-world and human-like typos (WikiTypo, R2ATA). Using a unified sampling-and-voting framework (Agent Forest), we evaluate six open-source models (Qwen3-4B/14B, Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma3-4B/12B) across four benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU-Math, MultiArith), with various numbers of agents n from one to 25 (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25). Our findings show that (1) Noise type matters: punctuation noise harm scales with its severity, and the human typos remain the dominant bottleneck, yielding the largest gaps to Clean accuracy and the highest ASR even with a large number of agents. And (2) Collaboration reliably improves accuracy as the number of agents, n, increases, with the largest gains from one to five agents and diminishing returns beyond 10 agents. However, the adversarial robustness gap persists regardless of the agent count.

<title>Think Consistently, Reason Efficiently: Energy-Based Calibration for Implicit Chain-of-Thought</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities through \emph{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting, which enables step-by-step intermediate reasoning. However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model. Extensive experiments across mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the consistency and efficiency of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning large language models.However, conventional LoRA adapters are typically trained for a single task, limiting their applicability in real-world settings where inputs may span diverse and unpredictable domains. At inference time, existing approaches combine multiple LoRAs for improving performance on diverse tasks, while usually requiring labeled data or additional task-specific training, which is expensive at scale. In this work, we introduce LoRA on the Go (LoGo), a training-free framework that dynamically selects and merges adapters at the instance level without any additional requirements. LoGo leverages signals extracted from a single forward pass through LoRA adapters, to identify the most relevant adapters and determine their contributions on-the-fly. Across 5 NLP benchmarks, 27 datasets, and 3 model families, LoGo outperforms training-based baselines on some tasks upto a margin of 3.6% while remaining competitive on other tasks and maintaining inference throughput, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modern medicine, yet their application in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains severely limited by the absence of standardized benchmarks and the scarcity of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we introduce TCM-Eval, the first dynamic and extensible benchmark for TCM, meticulously curated from national medical licensing examinations and validated by TCM experts. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale training corpus and propose Self-Iterative Chain-of-Thought Enhancement (SI-CoTE) to autonomously enrich question-answer pairs with validated reasoning chains through rejection sampling, establishing a virtuous cycle of data and model co-evolution. Using this enriched training data, we develop ZhiMingTang (ZMT), a state-of-the-art LLM specifically designed for TCM, which significantly exceeds the passing threshold for human practitioners. To encourage future research and development, we release a public leaderboard, fostering community engagement and continuous improvement.

<title>Categorical Emotions or Appraisals - Which Emotion Model Explains Argument Convincingness Better?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07162</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The convincingness of an argument does not only depend on its structure (logos), the person who makes the argument (ethos), but also on the emotion that it causes in the recipient (pathos). While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals. This work presents the first systematic comparison between emotion models for convincingness prediction, demonstrating the advantage of appraisals, providing insights for theoretical and practical applications in computational argumentation.

Abstract: We propose AdaRec, a few-shot in-context learning framework that leverages large language models for an adaptive personalized recommendation. AdaRec introduces narrative profiling, transforming user-item interactions into natural language representations to enable unified task handling and enhance human readability. Centered on a bivariate reasoning paradigm, AdaRec employs a dual-channel architecture that integrates horizontal behavioral alignment, discovering peer-driven patterns, with vertical causal attribution, highlighting decisive factors behind user preferences. Unlike existing LLM-based approaches, AdaRec eliminates manual feature engineering through semantic representations and supports rapid cross-task adaptation with minimal supervision. Experiments on real ecommerce datasets demonstrate that AdaRec outperforms both machine learning models and LLM-based baselines by up to eight percent in few-shot settings. In zero-shot scenarios, it achieves up to a nineteen percent improvement over expert-crafted profiling, showing effectiveness for long-tail personalization with minimal interaction data. Furthermore, lightweight fine-tuning on synthetic data generated by AdaRec matches the performance of fully fine-tuned models, highlighting its efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world communication settings, yet their ability to resolve context-dependent ambiguity remains underexplored. In this work, we present EMODIS, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capacity to interpret ambiguous emoji expressions under minimal but contrastive textual contexts. Each instance in EMODIS comprises an ambiguous sentence containing an emoji, two distinct disambiguating contexts that lead to divergent interpretations, and a specific question that requires contextual reasoning. We evaluate both open-source and API-based LLMs, and find that even the strongest models frequently fail to distinguish meanings when only subtle contextual cues are present. Further analysis reveals systematic biases toward dominant interpretations and limited sensitivity to pragmatic contrast. EMODIS provides a rigorous testbed for assessing contextual disambiguation, and highlights the gap in semantic reasoning between humans and LLMs.

<title>Discourse Graph Guided Document Translation with Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2511.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting large language models to full document translation remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing long-range dependencies and preserving discourse coherence throughout extended texts. While recent agentic machine translation systems mitigate context window constraints through multi-agent orchestration and persistent memory, they require substantial computational resources and are sensitive to memory retrieval strategies. We introduce TransGraph, a discourse-guided framework that explicitly models inter-chunk relationships through structured discourse graphs and selectively conditions each translation segment on relevant graph neighbourhoods rather than relying on sequential or exhaustive context. Across three document-level MT benchmarks spanning six languages and diverse domains, TransGraph consistently surpasses strong baselines in translation quality and terminology consistency while incurring significantly lower token overhead.

Abstract: News articles often reference numerous organizations, but traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) treats all mentions equally, obscuring which entities genuinely drive the narrative. This limits downstream tasks that rely on understanding event salience, influence, or narrative focus. We introduce Protagonist Entity Recognition (PER), a task that identifies the organizations that anchor a news story and shape its main developments. To validate PER, we compare he predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) against annotations from four expert annotators over a gold corpus, establishing both inter-annotator consistency and human-LLM agreement. Leveraging these findings, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically label large-scale news collections through NER-guided prompting, generating scalable, high-quality supervision. We then evaluate whether other LLMs, given reduced context and without explicit candidate guidance, can still infer the correct protagonists. Our results demonstrate that PER is a feasible and meaningful extension to narrative-centered information extraction, and that guided LLMs can approximate human judgments of narrative importance at scale.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Bangla hate speech identification, a socially impactful yet linguistically challenging task. As part of the "Bangla Multi-task Hate Speech Identification" shared task at the BLP Workshop, IJCNLP-AACL 2025, our team "Retriv" participated in all three subtasks: (1A) hate type classification, (1B) target group identification, and (1C) joint detection of type, severity, and target. For subtasks 1A and 1B, we employed a soft-voting ensemble of transformer models (BanglaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERTv2). For subtask 1C, we trained three multitask variants and aggregated their predictions through a weighted voting ensemble. Our systems achieved micro-f1 scores of 72.75% (1A) and 72.69% (1B), and a weighted micro-f1 score of 72.62% (1C). On the shared task leaderboard, these corresponded to 9th, 10th, and 7th positions, respectively. These results highlight the promise of transformer ensembles and weighted multitask frameworks for advancing Bangla hate speech detection in low-resource contexts. We made experimental scripts publicly available for the community.

<title>ACE-ICD: Acronym Expansion As Data Augmentation For Automated ICD Coding</title>

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding, the task of assigning disease and procedure codes to electronic medical records, is crucial for clinical documentation and billing. While existing methods primarily enhance model understanding of code hierarchies and synonyms, they often overlook the pervasive use of medical acronyms in clinical notes, a key factor in ICD code inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel effective data augmentation technique that leverages large language models to expand medical acronyms, allowing models to be trained on their full form representations. Moreover, we incorporate consistency training to regularize predictions by enforcing agreement between the original and augmented documents. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our approach, ACE-ICD establishes new state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings, including common codes, rare codes, and full-code assignments. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Adaptive Verifiable Environments (RLVE), an approach using verifiable environments that procedurally generate problems and provide algorithmically verifiable rewards, to scale up RL for language models (LMs). RLVE enables each verifiable environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses. In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute. We release our code publicly.

Abstract: Despite substantial advances, large language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet incorrect responses. In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.

Abstract: While LLMs have shown great success in financial tasks like stock prediction and question answering, their application in fully automating Equity Research Report generation remains uncharted territory. In this paper, we formulate the Equity Research Report (ERR) Generation task for the first time. To address the data scarcity and the evaluation metrics absence, we present an open-source evaluation benchmark for ERR generation - FinRpt. We frame a Dataset Construction Pipeline that integrates 7 financial data types and produces a high-quality ERR dataset automatically, which could be used for model training and evaluation. We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation system including 11 metrics to assess the generated ERRs. Moreover, we propose a multi-agent framework specifically tailored to address this task, named FinRpt-Gen, and train several LLM-based agents on the proposed datasets using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results indicate the data quality and metrics effectiveness of the benchmark FinRpt and the strong performance of FinRpt-Gen, showcasing their potential to drive innovation in the ERR generation field. All code and datasets are publicly available.

<title>Selecting Auxiliary Data via Neural Tangent Kernels for Low-Resource Domains</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across widespread tasks, yet their application in low-resource domains remains a significant challenge due to data scarcity and the high risk of overfitting. While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \textbf{\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the automated generation of code from natural language prompts. However, low-resource languages (LRLs) like Bangla remain underrepresented due to the limited availability of instruction-to-code datasets and evaluation benchmarks. To address this, the BLP Workshop at IJCNLP-AACL 2025 introduced a shared task on "Code Generation in Bangla". In this work, we propose a method that combines instruction prompting with a test-driven, feedback-guided iterative refinement process using a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model. The model generates code from Bangla instructions, tests it against unit tests, and iteratively refines any failing outputs through three evaluation passes, using test feedback to guide each step. This approach helped our team "Retriv" to secure 2nd place in the shared task with a Pass@1 score of 0.934. The analysis highlights challenges in Bangla instruction understanding and Python code generation, emphasizing the need for targeted methods in LRLs. We made experimental scripts publicly available for the community.

In this work, we study how to convert existing pretrained non-recurrent language models into depth-recurrent models. We find that using a curriculum of recurrences to increase the effective depth of the model over the course of training preserves performance while reducing total computational cost. In our experiments, on mathematics, we observe that converting pretrained models to recurrent ones results in better performance at a given compute budget than simply post-training the original non-recurrent language model.

Abstract: In da Vinci robotic surgery, surgeons' hands and eyes are fully engaged in the procedure, making it difficult to access and manipulate multimodal patient data without interruption. We propose a voice-directed Surgical Agent Orchestrator Platform (SAOP) built on a hierarchical multi-agent framework, consisting of an orchestration agent and three task-specific agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). These LLM-based agents autonomously plan, refine, validate, and reason to map voice commands into specific tasks such as retrieving clinical information, manipulating CT scans, or navigating 3D anatomical models on the surgical video. We also introduce a Multi-level Orchestration Evaluation Metric (MOEM) to comprehensively assess the performance and robustness from command-level and category-level perspectives. The SAOP achieves high accuracy and success rates across 240 voice commands, while LLM-based agents improve robustness against speech recognition errors and diverse or ambiguous free-form commands, demonstrating strong potential to support minimally invasive da Vinci robotic surgery.

Abstract: Deploying conversational voice agents with large language models faces a critical challenge: cloud-based foundation models provide deep reasoning and domain knowledge but introduce latency that disrupts natural conversation, while on-device models respond immediately but lack sophistication. We propose conversational infill, a task where a lightweight on-device model generates contextually appropriate dialogue while seamlessly incorporating streaming knowledge from a powerful backend model. This approach decouples response latency from model capability, enabling systems that feel responsive while accessing the full power of large-scale models. We present ConvFill, a 360M parameter model trained on synthetic multi-domain conversations. Evaluation across multiple backend models shows that conversational infill can be successfully learned, with ConvFill achieving accuracy improvements of 36-42% over standalone small models of the same size while consistently retaining sub-200ms response latencies. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach for building on-device conversational agents that are both immediately responsive and knowledgeable.

Abstract: We introduce SPOT (Stopping Points in Online Threads), the first annotated corpus translating the sociological concept of stopping point into a reproducible NLP task. Stopping points are ordinary critical interventions that pause or redirect online discussions through a range of forms (irony, subtle doubt or fragmentary arguments) that frameworks like counterspeech or social correction often overlook. We operationalize this concept as a binary classification task and provide reliable annotation guidelines. The corpus contains 43,305 manually annotated French Facebook comments linked to URLs flagged as false information by social media users, enriched with contextual metadata (article, post, parent comment, page or group, and source). We benchmark fine-tuned encoder models (CamemBERT) and instruction-tuned LLMs under various prompting strategies. Results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform prompted LLMs in F1 score by more than 10 percentage points, confirming the importance of supervised learning for emerging non-English social media tasks. Incorporating contextual metadata further improves encoder models F1 scores from 0.75 to 0.78. We release the anonymized dataset, along with the annotation guidelines and code in our code repository, to foster transparency and reproducible research.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) are rapidly being applied to radiology, enabling automated image interpretation and report generation tasks. Their deployment in clinical practice requires both high diagnostic accuracy and low inference latency, which in turn demands powerful hardware. High-performance graphical processing units (GPUs) provide the necessary compute and memory throughput to run large LLMs on imaging data. We review modern GPU architectures (e.g. NVIDIA A100/H100, AMD Instinct MI250X/MI300) and key performance metrics of floating-point throughput, memory bandwidth, VRAM capacity. We show how these hardware capabilities affect radiology tasks: for example, generating reports or detecting findings on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR images is computationally intensive and benefits from GPU parallelism and tensor-core acceleration. Empirical studies indicate that using appropriate GPU resources can reduce inference time and improve throughput. We discuss practical challenges including privacy, deployment, cost, power and optimization strategies: mixed-precision, quantization, compression, and multi-GPU scaling. Finally, we anticipate that next-generation features (8-bit tensor cores, enhanced interconnect) will further enable on-premise and federated radiology AI. Advancing GPU infrastructure is essential for safe, efficient LLM-based radiology diagnostics.

Abstract: Oscar nominations are an important factor in the movie industry because they can boost both the visibility and the commercial success. This work explores whether it is possible to predict Oscar nominations for screenplays using modern language models. Since no suitable dataset was available, a new one called Movie-O-Label was created by combining the MovieSum collection of movie scripts with curated Oscar records. Each screenplay was represented by its title, Wikipedia summary, and full script. Long scripts were split into overlapping text chunks and encoded with the E5 sentence em bedding model. Then, the screenplay embed dings were classified using a logistic regression model. The best results were achieved when three feature inputs related to screenplays (script, summary, and title) were combined. The best-performing model reached a macro F1 score of 0.66, a precision recall AP of 0.445 with baseline 0.19 and a ROC-AUC of 0.79. The results suggest that even simple models based on modern text embeddings demonstrate good prediction performance and might be a starting point for future research.

Abstract: Music language models (Music LMs), like vision language models, leverage multimodal representations to answer natural language queries about musical audio recordings. Although Music LMs are reportedly improving, we find that current evaluations fail to capture whether their answers are correct. Specifically, for all Music LMs that we examine, widely-used evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore fail to measure anything beyond linguistic fluency of the model's responses. To measure the true performance of Music LMs, we propose (1) a better general-purpose evaluation metric for Music LMs adapted to the music domain and (2) a factual evaluation framework to quantify the correctness of a Music LM's responses. Our framework is agnostic to the modality of the question-answering model and could be generalized to quantify performance in other open-ended question-answering domains. We use open datasets in our experiments and will release all code on publication.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks like visual question answering and multimodal text generation, but their effectiveness in scientific domains such as materials science remains limited. While some machine learning methods have addressed specific challenges in this field, there is still a lack of foundation models designed for broad tasks like polymer property prediction using multimodal data. In this work, we present a multimodal polymer dataset to fine-tune VLMs through instruction-tuning pairs and assess the impact of multimodality on prediction performance. Our fine-tuned models, using LoRA, outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal learning. Additionally, this approach reduces the need to train separate models for different properties, lowering deployment and maintenance costs.

Abstract: The complexity of human cognition has meant that psychology makes more use of theory and conceptual models than perhaps any other biomedical field. To enable precise quantitative study of the full breadth of phenomena in psychological and psychiatric medicine as well as cognitive aspects of AI safety, there is a need for a mathematical formulation which is both mathematically precise and equally accessible to experts from numerous fields. In this paper we formalize human psychodynamics via the diagrammatic framework of process theory, describe its key properties, and explain the links between a diagrammatic representation and central concepts in analysis of cognitive processes in contexts such as psychotherapy, neurotechnology, AI alignment, AI agent representation of individuals in autonomous negotiations, developing human-like AI systems, and other aspects of AI safety.

<title>A Representation Sharpening Framework for Zero Shot Dense Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot dense retrieval is a challenging setting where a document corpus is provided without relevant queries, necessitating a reliance on pretrained dense retrievers (DRs). However, since these DRs are not trained on the target corpus, they struggle to represent semantic differences between similar documents. To address this failing, we introduce a training-free representation sharpening framework that augments a document's representation with information that helps differentiate it from similar documents in the corpus. On over twenty datasets spanning multiple languages, the representation sharpening framework proves consistently superior to traditional retrieval, setting a new state-of-the-art on the BRIGHT benchmark. We show that representation sharpening is compatible with prior approaches to zero-shot dense retrieval and consistently improves their performance. Finally, we address the performance-cost tradeoff presented by our framework and devise an indexing-time approximation that preserves the majority of our performance gains over traditional retrieval, yet suffers no additional inference-time cost.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown promising performance on tabular data compared to their classical counterparts such as neural networks and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) in scenarios with limited training data. They utilize their pre-trained knowledge to adapt to new domains, achieving commendable performance with only a few training examples, also called the few-shot regime. However, the performance gain in the few-shot regime comes at the expense of significantly increased complexity and number of parameters. To circumvent this trade-off, we introduce TabDistill, a new strategy to distill the pre-trained knowledge in complex transformer-based models into simpler neural networks for effectively classifying tabular data. Our framework yields the best of both worlds: being parameter-efficient while performing well with limited training data. The distilled neural networks surpass classical baselines such as regular neural networks, XGBoost and logistic regression under equal training data, and in some cases, even the original transformer-based models that they were distilled from.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been driven largely by undisclosed datasets and proprietary data synthesis recipes, leaving open questions about how to systematically build large-scale, vision-centric reasoning datasets, particularly for tasks that go beyond visual math. In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.

Abstract: Musical instrument classification is essential for music information retrieval (MIR) and generative music systems. However, research on non-Western traditions, particularly Persian music, remains limited. We address this gap by introducing a new dataset of isolated recordings covering seven traditional Persian instruments, two common but originally non-Persian instruments (i.e., violin, piano), and vocals. We propose a culturally informed data augmentation strategy that generates realistic polyphonic mixtures from monophonic samples. Using the MERT model (Music undERstanding with large-scale self-supervised Training) with a classification head, we evaluate our approach with out-of-distribution data which was obtained by manually labeling segments of traditional songs. On real-world polyphonic Persian music, the proposed method yielded the best ROC-AUC (0.795), highlighting complementary benefits of tonal and temporal coherence. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of culturally grounded augmentation for robust Persian instrument recognition and provide a foundation for culturally inclusive MIR and diverse music generation systems.

<title>Anchors in the Machine: Behavioral and Attributional Evidence of Anchoring Bias in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly examined as both behavioral subjects and decision systems, yet it remains unclear whether observed cognitive biases reflect surface imitation or deeper probability shifts. Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.

Abstract: Building trustworthy clinical AI systems requires not only accurate predictions but also transparent, biologically grounded explanations. We present \texttt{DiagnoLLM}, a hybrid framework that integrates Bayesian deconvolution, eQTL-guided deep learning, and LLM-based narrative generation for interpretable disease diagnosis. DiagnoLLM begins with GP-unmix, a Gaussian Process-based hierarchical model that infers cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data while modeling biological uncertainty. These features, combined with regulatory priors from eQTL analysis, power a neural classifier that achieves high predictive performance in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection (88.0\% accuracy). To support human understanding and trust, we introduce an LLM-based reasoning module that translates model outputs into audience-specific diagnostic reports, grounded in clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge. Human evaluations confirm that these reports are accurate, actionable, and appropriately tailored for both physicians and patients. Our findings show that LLMs, when deployed as post-hoc reasoners rather than end-to-end predictors, can serve as effective communicators within hybrid diagnostic pipelines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in solving complex tasks when integrated with external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become a standard interface for enabling such tool-based interactions. However, these interactions introduce substantial security concerns, particularly when the MCP server is compromised or untrustworthy. While prior benchmarks primarily focus on prompt injection attacks or analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM MCP interaction trajectories, limited attention has been given to the underlying system logs associated with malicious MCP servers. To address this gap, we present the first synthetic benchmark for evaluating LLMs ability to identify security risks from system logs. We define nine categories of MCP server risks and generate 1,800 synthetic system logs using ten state-of-the-art LLMs. These logs are embedded in the return values of 243 curated MCP servers, yielding a dataset of 2,421 chat histories for training and 471 queries for evaluation. Our pilot experiments reveal that smaller models often fail to detect risky system logs, leading to high false negatives. While models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) tend to over-flag benign logs, resulting in elevated false positives, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) offers a better precision-recall balance. In particular, after training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct achieves 83% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing large remote model by 9 percentage points. Fine-grained, per-category analysis further underscores the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing LLM safety within the MCP framework.

Abstract: User simulation is important for developing and evaluating human-centered AI, yet current student simulation in educational applications has significant limitations. Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes.

Abstract: LLMs are now an integral part of information retrieval. As such, their role as question answering chatbots raises significant concerns due to their shown vulnerability to adversarial man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Here, we propose the first principled attack evaluation on LLM factual memory under prompt injection via Xmera, our novel, theory-grounded MitM framework. By perturbing the input given to "victim" LLMs in three closed-book and fact-based QA settings, we undermine the correctness of the responses and assess the uncertainty of their generation process. Surprisingly, trivial instruction-based attacks report the highest success rate (up to ~85.3%) while simultaneously having a high uncertainty for incorrectly answered questions. To provide a simple defense mechanism against Xmera, we train Random Forest classifiers on the response uncertainty levels to distinguish between attacked and unattacked queries (average AUC of up to ~96%). We believe that signaling users to be cautious about the answers they receive from black-box and potentially corrupt LLMs is a first checkpoint toward user cyberspace safety.

Abstract: We propose Self-correction Relative Policy Optimization (ScRPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance large language models on challenging mathemati- cal problems by leveraging self-reflection and error correction. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Trial-and-error learning stage: training the model with GRPO and collect- ing incorrect answers along with their cor- responding questions in an error pool; (2) Self-correction learning stage: guiding the model to reflect on why its previous an- swers were wrong. Extensive experiments across multiple math reasoning benchmarks, including AIME, AMC, Olympiad, MATH- 500, GSM8k, using Deepseek-Distill-Qwen- 1.5B and Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-7B. The ex- perimental results demonstrate that ScRPO consistently outperforms several post-training methods. These findings highlight ScRPO as a promising paradigm for enabling language models to self-improve on difficult tasks with limited external feedback, paving the way to- ward more reliable and capable AI systems.

Abstract: Simulated Students offer a valuable methodological framework for evaluating pedagogical approaches and modelling diverse learner profiles, tasks which are otherwise challenging to undertake systematically in real-world settings. Recent research has increasingly focused on developing such simulated agents to capture a range of learning styles, cognitive development pathways, and social behaviours. Among contemporary simulation techniques, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational research has emerged as a particularly versatile and scalable paradigm. LLMs afford a high degree of linguistic realism and behavioural adaptability, enabling agents to approximate cognitive processes and engage in contextually appropriate pedagogical dialogues. This paper presents a thematic review of empirical and methodological studies utilising LLMs to simulate student behaviour across educational environments. We synthesise current evidence on the capacity of LLM-based agents to emulate learner archetypes, respond to instructional inputs, and interact within multi-agent classroom scenarios. Furthermore, we examine the implications of such systems for curriculum development, instructional evaluation, and teacher training. While LLMs surpass rule-based systems in natural language generation and situational flexibility, ongoing concerns persist regarding algorithmic bias, evaluation reliability, and alignment with educational objectives. The review identifies existing technological and methodological gaps and proposes future research directions for integrating generative AI into adaptive learning systems and instructional design.

Abstract: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment specific tasks and demonstrations. Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SynthAgent.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted into frameworks that grant them the capacity to make real decisions, it is increasingly important to ensure that they are unbiased. In this paper, we argue that the predominant approach of simply removing existing biases from models is not enough. Using a paradigm from the psychology literature, we demonstrate that LLMs can spontaneously develop novel social biases about artificial demographic groups even when no inherent differences exist. These biases result in highly stratified task allocations, which are less fair than assignments by human participants and are exacerbated by newer and larger models. In social science, emergent biases like these have been shown to result from exploration-exploitation trade-offs, where the decision-maker explores too little, allowing early observations to strongly influence impressions about entire demographic groups. To alleviate this effect, we examine a series of interventions targeting model inputs, problem structure, and explicit steering. We find that explicitly incentivizing exploration most robustly reduces stratification, highlighting the need for better multifaceted objectives to mitigate bias. These results reveal that LLMs are not merely passive mirrors of human social biases, but can actively create new ones from experience, raising urgent questions about how these systems will shape societies over time.

Abstract: While recent safety guardrails effectively suppress overtly biased outputs, subtler forms of social bias emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks that evade current evaluation benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical.

<title>Enhancing Adversarial Robustness of IoT Intrusion Detection via SHAP-Based Attribution Fingerprinting</title>

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed numerous industries by enabling seamless connectivity and data-driven automation. However, this expansion has also exposed IoT networks to increasingly sophisticated security threats, including adversarial attacks targeting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) to deliberately evade detection, induce misclassification, and systematically undermine the reliability and integrity of security defenses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial detection model that enhances the robustness of IoT IDS against adversarial attacks through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based fingerprinting. Using SHAP's DeepExplainer, we extract attribution fingerprints from network traffic features, enabling the IDS to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarially perturbed inputs. By capturing subtle attribution patterns, the model becomes more resilient to evasion attempts and adversarial manipulations. We evaluated the model on a standard IoT benchmark dataset, where it significantly outperformed a state-of-the-art method in detecting adversarial attacks. In addition to enhanced robustness, this approach improves model transparency and interpretability, thereby increasing trust in the IDS through explainable AI.

<title>Reasoning with Confidence: Efficient Verification of LLM Reasoning Steps via Uncertainty Heads</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06209</link>

Abstract: Solving complex tasks usually requires LLMs to generate long multi-step reasoning chains. Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.

Abstract: Challenging the prevailing consensus that small models inherently lack robust reasoning, this report introduces VibeThinker-1.5B, a 1.5B-parameter dense model developed via our Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP). This challenges the prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800, VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its base model's 0.0. These findings demonstrate that small models can achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to large models, drastically reducing training and inference costs and thereby democratizing advanced AI research.

<title>Mixtures of SubExperts for Large Language Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to a continuous stream of tasks is a critical yet challenging endeavor. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in both knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings.

<title>Enhancing Multimodal Misinformation Detection by Replaying the Whole Story from Image Modality Perspective</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) refers to the task of detecting social media posts involving misinformation, where the post often contains text and image modalities. However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features. Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of RETSIMD.

Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on visual cues from the target speaker. However, humans also leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntactic constraints, next word prediction, and prior knowledge of conversation, to extract target speech. Inspired by this observation, we propose ELEGANCE, a novel framework that incorporates linguistic knowledge from large language models (LLMs) into AV-TSE models through three distinct guidance strategies: output linguistic constraints, intermediate linguistic prediction, and input linguistic prior. Comprehensive experiments with RoBERTa, Qwen3-0.6B, and Qwen3-4B on two AV-TSE backbones demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach. Significant improvements are observed in challenging scenarios, including visual cue impaired, unseen languages, target speaker switches, increased interfering speakers, and out-of-domain test set.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in reasoning, question answering, and professional applications; however, their true capabilities remain difficult to evaluate using existing benchmarks. Current datasets often focus on simplified tasks or artificial scenarios, overlooking long-tail knowledge and the complexities of real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose LPFQA, a long-tail knowledge-based benchmark derived from authentic professional forums across 20 academic and industrial fields, covering 502 tasks grounded in practical expertise. LPFQA introduces four key innovations: fine-grained evaluation dimensions that target knowledge depth, reasoning, terminology comprehension, and contextual analysis; a hierarchical difficulty structure that ensures semantic clarity and unique answers; authentic professional scenario modeling with realistic user personas; and interdisciplinary knowledge integration across diverse domains. We evaluated 12 mainstream LLMs on LPFQA and observed significant performance disparities, especially in specialized reasoning tasks. LPFQA provides a robust, authentic, and discriminative benchmark for advancing LLM evaluation and guiding future model development.

<title>MONICA: Real-Time Monitoring and Calibration of Chain-of-Thought Sycophancy in Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from sycophantic behavior, where models tend to agree with users' incorrect beliefs and follow misinformation rather than maintain independent reasoning. This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.

Abstract: Test-time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) has shown promise in adapting foundation models for complex tasks at test-time, resulting in large performance improvements. TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second. To address this, we propose context-guided TTRL (CG-TTRL), integrating context dynamically into both sampling phases and propose a method for efficient context selection for on-device applications. Our evaluations on mathematical and scientific QA benchmarks show CG-TTRL outperforms TTRL (e.g. additional 7% relative accuracy improvement over TTRL), while boosting efficiency by obtaining strong performance after only a few steps of test-time training (e.g. 8% relative improvement rather than 1% over TTRL after 3 steps).

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables Large Language Models to solve complex problems, but deploying these models safely requires reliable confidence estimates, a capability where existing methods suffer from poor calibration and severe overconfidence on incorrect predictions. We propose Enhanced Dirichlet and Topology Risk (EDTR), a novel decoding strategy that combines topological analysis with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification to measure LLM confidence across multiple reasoning paths. EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty. We evaluate EDTR against three state-of-the-art calibration methods across four diverse reasoning benchmarks spanning olympiad-level mathematics (AIME), grade school math (GSM8K), commonsense reasoning, and stock price prediction \cite{zhang2025aime, cobbe2021training, talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa, yahoo_finance}. EDTR achieves 41\% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672, while notably achieving perfect accuracy on AIME and exceptional calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107, domains where baselines exhibit severe overconfidence. Our work provides a geometric framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enabling more reliable deployment where calibrated confidence estimates are essential.

Abstract: In this work, we study the risks of collective financial fraud in large-scale multi-agent systems powered by large language model (LLM) agents. We investigate whether agents can collaborate in fraudulent behaviors, how such collaboration amplifies risks, and what factors influence fraud success. To support this research, we present MultiAgentFraudBench, a large-scale benchmark for simulating financial fraud scenarios based on realistic online interactions. The benchmark covers 28 typical online fraud scenarios, spanning the full fraud lifecycle across both public and private domains. We further analyze key factors affecting fraud success, including interaction depth, activity level, and fine-grained collaboration failure modes. Finally, we propose a series of mitigation strategies, including adding content-level warnings to fraudulent posts and dialogues, using LLMs as monitors to block potentially malicious agents, and fostering group resilience through information sharing at the societal level. Notably, we observe that malicious agents can adapt to environmental interventions. Our findings highlight the real-world risks of multi-agent financial fraud and suggest practical measures for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/zheng977/MutiAgent4Fraud.

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks, the building blocks of AI, were inspired by the human brain's network of neurons. Over the years, these networks have evolved to replicate the complex capabilities of the brain, allowing them to handle tasks such as image and language processing. In the realm of Large Language Models, there has been a keen interest in making the language learning process more akin to that of humans. While neuroscientific research has shown that different grammatical categories are processed by different neurons in the brain, we show that LLMs operate in a similar way. Utilizing Llama 3, we identify the most important neurons associated with the prediction of words belonging to different part-of-speech tags. Using the achieved knowledge, we train a classifier on a dataset, which shows that the activation patterns of these key neurons can reliably predict part-of-speech tags on fresh data. The results suggest the presence of a subspace in LLMs focused on capturing part-of-speech tag concepts, resembling patterns observed in lesion studies of the brain in neuroscience.

Abstract: The growing complexity of computational workloads has amplified the need for efficient and specialized hardware accelerators. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have emerged as prominent solutions, each excelling in specific domains. Although there is substantial research comparing FPGAs and GPUs, most of the work focuses primarily on performance metrics, offering limited insight into the specific types of applications that each accelerator benefits the most. This paper aims to bridge this gap by synthesizing insights from various research articles to guide users in selecting the appropriate accelerator for domain-specific applications. By categorizing the reviewed studies and analyzing key performance metrics, this work highlights the strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases for FPGAs and GPUs. The findings offer actionable recommendations, helping researchers and practitioners navigate trade-offs in performance, energy efficiency, and programmability.

Abstract: Contracts are complex documents featuring detailed formal structures, explicit and implicit dependencies and rich semantic content. Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph. This allows for a more dynamic analysis, including building the groundwork for contract linting similar to what is now practiced in software engineering.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude 3.5, underscores the need to distinguish LLM-generated text from human-written content to mitigate the spread of misinformation and misuse in education. One promising approach to address this issue is the watermark technique, which embeds subtle statistical signals into LLM-generated text to enable reliable identification. In this paper, we first generalize the likelihood-based LLM detection method of a previous study by introducing a flexible weighted formulation, and further adapt this approach to the inverse transform sampling method. Moving beyond watermark detection, we extend this adaptive detection strategy to tackle the more challenging problem of segmenting a given text into watermarked and non-watermarked substrings. In contrast to the approach in a previous study, which relies on accurate estimation of next-token probabilities that are highly sensitive to prompt estimation, our proposed framework removes the need for precise prompt estimation. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology is both effective and robust in accurately segmenting texts containing a mixture of watermarked and non-watermarked content.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP have achieved impressive results in image-text retrieval by aligning image and text representations in a shared embedding space. However, these models often treat text as flat sequences, limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-form descriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties of language: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositional structure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions should result in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations, we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-style models without modifying the encoder architecture. HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly under long or compositional descriptions. The code is available at https://github.com/UnicomAI/HiMo-CLIP.

Abstract: How do we make a meaningful comparison of a large language model's knowledge of the law in one place compared to another? Quantifying these differences is critical to understanding if the quality of the legal information obtained by users of LLM-based chatbots varies depending on their location. However, obtaining meaningful comparative metrics is challenging because legal institutions in different places are not themselves easily comparable. In this work we propose a methodology to obtain place-to-place metrics based on the comparative law concept of functionalism. We construct a dataset of factual scenarios drawn from Reddit posts by users seeking legal advice for family, housing, employment, crime and traffic issues. We use these to elicit a summary of a law from the LLM relevant to each scenario in Los Angeles, London and Sydney. These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place. This suggests that the quality of legal solutions provided by these models is not evenly distributed across geography. Additionally, we show a strong negative correlation between hallucination rate and the frequency of the majority response when the LLM is sampled multiple times, suggesting a measure of uncertainty of model predictions of legal facts.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have spurred significant progress in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy. Our code will be released at https://github.com/qijianyu277/DifficultySampling.

<title>MENTOR: A Metacognition-Driven Self-Evolution Framework for Uncovering and Mitigating Implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks</title>

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and value alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment. Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.

Abstract: Internet of Agents (IoA) envisions a unified, agent-centric paradigm where heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents can interconnect and collaborate at scale. Within this paradigm, federated learning (FL) serves as a key enabler that allows distributed LLM agents to co-train global models without centralizing data. However, the FL-enabled IoA system remains vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, and the prevailing distance and similarity-based defenses become fragile at billion-parameter scale and under heterogeneous data distributions. This paper proposes a graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP) attack, which passively exploits observed benign local models to construct a parameter correlation graph and extends an adversarial variational graph autoencoder to capture and reshape higher-order dependencies. The GRMP attack synthesizes malicious local models that preserve benign-like statistics while embedding adversarial objectives, remaining elusive to detection at the server. Experiments demonstrate a gradual drop in system accuracy under the proposed attack and the ineffectiveness of the prevailing defense mechanism in detecting the attack, underscoring a severe threat to the ambitious IoA paradigm.

Abstract: Large-scale models are at the forefront of time series (TS) forecasting, dominated by two paradigms: fine-tuning text-based Large Language Models (LLM4TS) and training Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) from scratch. Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \textit{\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\times$ inference speedup. We validate the universality of our method on 8 prominent SOTA models (LLM4TS and TSFMs, 90M to 6B), showing that retaining less than 30\% of layers achieves comparable or superior accuracy in over 95\% of tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research agents have shown promise for autonomous knowledge construction through dynamic reasoning over external sources. However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\% to 42.5\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models.

Abstract: Reliability and failure detection of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment in high-stakes, multi-step reasoning tasks. Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses. However, most methods focus on single-step outputs and overlook the challenges of multi-step reasoning. In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, improving their trustworthiness and providing a practical framework for failure detection.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks, but they continue to struggle with spatial understanding. Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning.

Abstract: AI agents capable of controlling user interfaces have the potential to transform human interaction with digital devices. To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.

<title>Language Generation with Infinite Contamination</title>

Abstract: We study language generation in the limit, where an algorithm observes an adversarial enumeration of strings from an unknown target language $K$ and must eventually generate new, unseen strings from $K$. Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] proved that generation is achievable in surprisingly general settings. But their generator suffers from ``mode collapse,'' producing from an ever-smaller subset of the target. To address this, Kleinberg and Wei [KW25] require the generator's output to be ``dense'' in the target language. They showed that generation with density, surprisingly, remains achievable at the same generality.
  Both results assume perfect data: no noisy insertions and no omissions. This raises a central question: how much contamination can generation tolerate? Recent works made partial progress on this question by studying (non-dense) generation with either finite amounts of noise (but no omissions) or omissions (but no noise).
  We characterize robustness under contaminated enumerations: 1. Generation under Contamination: Language generation in the limit is achievable for all countable collections iff the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. When this fails, we characterize which collections are generable. 2. Dense Generation under Contamination: Dense generation is strictly less robust to contamination than generation. As a byproduct, we resolve an open question of Raman and Raman [ICML25] by showing that generation is possible with only membership oracle access under finitely many contaminated examples.
  Finally, we introduce a beyond-worst-case model inspired by curriculum learning and prove that dense generation is achievable even with infinite contamination provided the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. This suggests curriculum learning may be crucial for learning from noisy web data.

Abstract: Considering the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in logical reasoning and planning, prior efforts have sought to augment LLMs with access to external solvers. While progress has been made on simple reasoning problems, solving classical constraint satisfaction problems, such as the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) and Graph Coloring Problem (GCP), remains difficult for off-the-shelf solvers due to their intricate expressions and exponential search spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel differential logic layer-aided language modeling (DiLA) approach, where logical constraints are integrated into the forward and backward passes of a network layer, to provide another option for LLM tool learning. In DiLA, LLM aims to transform the language description to logic constraints and identify initial solutions of the highest quality, while the differential logic layer focuses on iteratively refining the LLM-prompted solution. Leveraging the logic layer as a bridge, DiLA enhances the logical reasoning ability of LLMs on a range of reasoning problems encoded by Boolean variables, guaranteeing the efficiency and correctness of the solution process. We evaluate the performance of DiLA on two classic reasoning problems and empirically demonstrate its consistent outperformance against existing prompt-based and solver-aided approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate natural language generation tasks as automated metrics. However, the likelihood, a measure of LLM's plausibility for a sentence, can vary due to superficial differences in sentences, such as word order and sentence structure. It is therefore possible that there might be a likelihood bias if LLMs are used for evaluation: they might overrate sentences with higher likelihoods while underrating those with lower likelihoods. In this paper, we investigate the presence and impact of likelihood bias in LLM-based evaluators. We also propose a method to mitigate the likelihood bias. Our method utilizes highly biased instances as few-shot examples for in-context learning. Our experiments in evaluating the data-to-text and grammatical error correction tasks reveal that several LLMs we test display a likelihood bias. Furthermore, our proposed method successfully mitigates this bias, also improving evaluation performance (in terms of correlation of models with human scores) significantly.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) technology has changed our role in interacting with these models. Instead of primarily testing these models with questions we already know answers to, we are now using them for queries where the answers are unknown to us, driven by human curiosity. This shift highlights the growing need to understand curiosity-driven human questions - those that are more complex, open-ended, and reflective of real-world needs. To this end, we present Quriosity, a collection of 13.5K naturally occurring questions from three diverse sources: human-to-search-engine queries, human-to-human interactions, and human-to-LLM conversations. Our comprehensive collection enables a rich understanding of human curiosity across various domains and contexts. Our analysis reveals a significant presence of causal questions (up to 42%) in the dataset, for which we develop an iterative prompt improvement framework to identify all causal queries and examine their unique linguistic properties, cognitive complexity and source distribution. Our paper paves the way for future work on causal question identification and open-ended chatbot interactions. Our code and data are at https://github.com/roberto-ceraolo/quriosity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative force in artificial intelligence, demonstrating exceptional proficiency across various tasks. However, their deployment in resource-constrained environments and concerns over user data privacy pose significant challenges. In contrast, Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency but often lag in performance. To address these issues, we propose FedCoT, a federated framework designed for the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation of knowledge from LLMs to SLMs, while ensuring the preservation of clients' data privacy. FedCoT ensures secure and efficient knowledge transfer from an LLM on a high-powered server to an SLM on a resource-constrained client, while adhering to privacy requirements. Leveraging perturbed prompts and rationales generated through the CoT approach, the framework enhances the performance of the client's SLM without compromising user data privacy within a multi-task learning framework. We propose two privacy protection strategies: the Exponential Mechanism Strategy and the Adaptive Exponential Mechanism Strategy, which balance user prompt privacy and the usability of rationales. Empirical evaluation on various text generation tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of FedCoT in training task-specific SLMs with enhanced performance while prioritizing data privacy protection. Our code has been contributed to the FATE open-source project and is now publicly accessible at \textit{https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE-LLM/tree/main/python/fate_llm/algo/fedcot}

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) through developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has brought significant advancements across various technological domains. While these models enhance capabilities in natural language processing and visual interactive tasks, their growing adoption raises critical concerns regarding security and ethical alignment. This survey provides an extensive review of the emerging field of jailbreaking--deliberately circumventing the ethical and operational boundaries of LLMs and VLMs--and the consequent development of defense mechanisms. Our study categorizes jailbreaks into seven distinct types and elaborates on defense strategies that address these vulnerabilities. Through this comprehensive examination, we identify research gaps and propose directions for future studies to enhance the security frameworks of LLMs and VLMs. Our findings underscore the necessity for a unified perspective that integrates both jailbreak strategies and defensive solutions to foster a robust, secure, and reliable environment for the next generation of language models.

Abstract: Tabular data is considered the last unconquered castle of deep learning, yet the task of data stream classification is stated to be an equally important and demanding research area. Due to the temporal constraints, it is assumed that deep learning methods are not the optimal solution for application in this field. However, excluding the entire -- and prevalent -- group of methods seems rather rash given the progress that has been made in recent years in its development. For this reason, the following paper is the first to present an approach to natural language data stream classification using the sentence space method, which allows for encoding text into the form of a discrete digital signal. This allows the use of convolutional deep networks dedicated to image classification to solve the task of recognizing fake news based on text data. Based on the real-life Fakeddit dataset, the proposed approach was compared with state-of-the-art algorithms for data stream classification based on generalization ability and time complexity.

Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires the iterative integration of scientific domain knowledge, statistical expertise, and an understanding of data semantics to make nuanced analytical decisions, e.g., about which variables, transformations, and statistical models to consider. LM-based agents equipped with planning, memory, and code execution capabilities have the potential to support data-driven science. However, evaluating agents on such open-ended tasks is challenging due to multiple valid approaches, partially correct steps, and different ways to express the same decisions. To address these challenges, we present BLADE, a benchmark to automatically evaluate agents' multifaceted approaches to open-ended research questions. BLADE consists of 12 datasets and research questions drawn from existing scientific literature, with ground truth collected from independent analyses by expert data scientists and researchers. To automatically evaluate agent responses, we developed corresponding computational methods to match different representations of analyses to this ground truth. Though language models possess considerable world knowledge, our evaluation shows that they are often limited to basic analyses. However, agents capable of interacting with the underlying data demonstrate improved, but still non-optimal, diversity in their analytical decision making. Our work enables the evaluation of agents for data-driven science and provides researchers deeper insights into agents' analysis approaches.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are great translators, but this is largely limited to high-resource languages. For many LLMs, translating in and out of low-resource languages remains a challenging task. To maximize data efficiency in this low-resource setting, we introduce Mufu, which includes a selection of automatically generated multilingual candidates and an instruction to correct inaccurate translations in the prompt. Mufu prompts turn a translation task into a postediting one, and seek to harness the LLM's reasoning capability with auxiliary translation candidates, from which the model is required to assess the input quality, align the semantics cross-lingually, copy from relevant inputs and override instances that are incorrect. Our experiments on En-XX translations over the Flores-200 dataset show LLMs finetuned against Mufu-style prompts are robust to poor quality auxiliary translation candidates, achieving performance superior to NLLB 1.3B distilled model in 64% of low- and very-low-resource language pairs. We then distill these models to reduce inference cost, while maintaining on average 3.1 chrF improvement over finetune-only baseline in low-resource translations.

Abstract: Circuit graph discovery has emerged as a fundamental approach to elucidating the skill mechanistic of language models. Despite the output faithfulness of circuit graphs, they suffer from atomic ablation, which causes the loss of causal dependencies between connected components. In addition, their discovery process, designed to preserve output faithfulness, inadvertently captures extraneous effects other than an isolated target skill. To alleviate these challenges, we introduce skill paths, which offers a more refined and compact representation by isolating individual skills within a linear chain of components. To enable skill path extracting from circuit graphs, we propose a three-step framework, consisting of decomposition, pruning, and post-pruning causal mediation. In particular, we offer a complete linear decomposition of the transformer model which leads to a disentangled computation graph. After pruning, we further adopt causal analysis techniques, including counterfactuals and interventions, to extract the final skill paths from the circuit graph. To underscore the significance of skill paths, we investigate three generic language skills-Previous Token Skill, Induction Skill, and In-Context Learning Skill-using our framework. Experiments support two crucial properties of these skills, namely stratification and inclusiveness.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the need for efficient and reliable methods to evaluate their performance. Traditional evaluation methods often face challenges like high costs, limited task formats, dependence on human references, and systematic biases. To address these limitations, we propose Auto-PRE, an automatic LLM evaluation framework inspired by the peer review process. Unlike previous approaches that rely on human annotations, Auto-PRE automatically selects evaluator LLMs based on three core traits: consistency, pertinence, and self-confidence, which correspond to the instruction, content, and response stages, respectively, and collectively cover the entire evaluation process. Experiments on three representative tasks, including summarization, non-factoid QA, and dialogue generation, demonstrate that Auto-PRE achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing evaluation costs. Furthermore, the structured and scalable design of our automatic qualification exam framework provides valuable insights into automating the evaluation of LLMs-as-judges, paving the way for more advanced LLM-based evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Due to their capacity to acquire world knowledge from large corpora, pre-trained language models (PLMs) are extensively used in ultra-fine entity typing tasks where the space of labels is extremely large. In this work, we explore the limitations of the knowledge acquired by PLMs by proposing a novel heuristic to approximate the pre-training distribution of entities when the pre-training data is unknown. Then, we systematically demonstrate that entity-typing approaches that rely solely on the parametric knowledge of PLMs struggle significantly with entities at the long tail of the pre-training distribution, and that knowledge-infused approaches can account for some of these shortcomings. Our findings suggest that we need to go beyond PLMs to produce solutions that perform well for infrequent entities.

Abstract: Historical documents in the Sinosphere are known to share common formats and practices, particularly in veritable records compiled by court historians. This shared linguistic heritage has led researchers to use Classical Chinese resources for cross-lingual transfer when processing historical documents from Korea and Japan, which remain relatively low-resource. In this paper, we question the assumption of cross-lingual transferability from Classical Chinese to Hanja and Kanbun, the ancient written languages of Korea and Japan, respectively. Our experiments across machine translation, named entity recognition, and punctuation restoration tasks show minimal impact of Classical Chinese datasets on language model performance for ancient Korean documents written in Hanja, with performance differences within $\pm{}0.0068$ F1-score for sequence labeling tasks and up to $+0.84$ BLEU score for translation. These limitations persist consistently across various model sizes, architectures, and domain-specific datasets. Our analysis reveals that the benefits of Classical Chinese resources diminish rapidly as local language data increases for Hanja, while showing substantial improvements only in extremely low-resource scenarios for both Korean and Japanese historical documents. These findings emphasize the need for careful empirical validation rather than assuming benefits from indiscriminate cross-lingual transfer.

Abstract: Learners of a second language (L2) often map non-native phonemes to similar native-language (L1) phonemes, making conventional L2-focused training slow and effortful. To address this, we propose an L1-grounded pronunciation training method based on compositional phoneme approximation (CPA), a feature-based representation technique that approximates L2 sounds with sequences of L1 phonemes. Evaluations with 20 Korean non-native English speakers show that CPA-based training achieves a 76% in-box formant rate in acoustic analysis, 17.6% relative improvement in phoneme recognition accuracy, and over 80% of speech being rated as more native-like, with minimal training.

Abstract: Mining parallel document pairs for document-level machine translation (MT) remains challenging due to the limitations of existing Cross-Lingual Document Alignment (CLDA) techniques. Existing methods often rely on metadata such as URLs, which are scarce, or on pooled document representations that fail to capture fine-grained alignment cues. Moreover, the limited context window of sentence embedding models hinders their ability to represent document-level context, while sentence-based alignment introduces a combinatorially large search space, leading to high computational cost. To address these challenges for Indic languages, we introduce Pralekha, a benchmark containing over 3 million aligned document pairs across 11 Indic languages and English, which includes 1.5 million English-Indic pairs. Furthermore, we propose Document Alignment Coefficient (DAC), a novel metric for fine-grained document alignment. Unlike pooling-based methods, DAC aligns documents by matching smaller chunks and computes similarity as the ratio of aligned chunks to the average number of chunks in a pair. Intrinsic evaluation shows that our chunk-based method is 2-3x faster while maintaining competitive performance, and that DAC achieves substantial gains over pooling-based baselines. Extrinsic evaluation further demonstrates that document-level MT models trained on DAC-aligned pairs consistently outperform those using baseline alignment methods. These results highlight DAC's effectiveness for parallel document mining. The dataset and evaluation framework are publicly available to support further research.

<title>LLM Teacher-Student Framework for Text Classification With No Manually Annotated Data: A Case Study in IPTC News Topic Classification</title>

Abstract: With the ever-increasing number of news stories available online, classifying them by topic, regardless of the language they are written in, has become crucial for enhancing readers' access to relevant content. To address this challenge, we propose a teacher-student framework based on large language models (LLMs) for developing multilingual news topic classification models of reasonable size with no need for manual data annotation. The framework employs a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model as the teacher model to develop a news topic training dataset through automatic annotation of 20,000 news articles in Slovenian, Croatian, Greek, and Catalan. Articles are classified into 17 main categories from the Media Topic schema, developed by the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC). The teacher model exhibits high zero-shot performance in all four languages. Its agreement with human annotators is comparable to that between the human annotators themselves. To mitigate the computational limitations associated with the requirement of processing millions of texts daily, smaller BERT-like student models are fine-tuned on the GPT-annotated dataset. These student models achieve high performance comparable to the teacher model. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the training data size on the performance of the student models and investigate their monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities. The findings indicate that student models can achieve high performance with a relatively small number of training instances, and demonstrate strong zero-shot cross-lingual abilities. Finally, we publish the best-performing news topic classifier, enabling multilingual classification with the top-level categories of the IPTC Media Topic schema.

Abstract: Rare diseases, despite their low individual incidence, collectively impact around 300 million people worldwide due to the vast number of diseases. The involvement of multiple organs and systems, and the shortage of specialized doctors with relevant experience, make diagnosing and treating rare diseases more challenging than common diseases. Recently, agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable applications across various domains. In the medical field, some agent methods have outperformed direct prompts in question-answering tasks from medical examinations. However, current agent frameworks are not well-adapted to real-world clinical scenarios, especially those involving the complex demands of rare diseases. To bridge this gap, we introduce RareAgents, the first LLM-driven multi-disciplinary team decision-support tool designed specifically for the complex clinical context of rare diseases. RareAgents integrates advanced Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) coordination, memory mechanisms, and medical tools utilization, leveraging Llama-3.1-8B/70B as the base model. Experimental results show that RareAgents outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models, GPT-4o, and current agent frameworks in diagnosis and treatment for rare diseases. Furthermore, we contribute a novel rare disease dataset, MIMIC-IV-Ext-Rare, to facilitate further research in this field.

Abstract: People acquire concepts through rich physical and social experiences and use them to understand and navigate the world. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), trained solely through next-token prediction on text, exhibit strikingly human-like behaviors. Are these models developing concepts akin to those of humans? If so, how are such concepts represented, organized, and related to behavior? Here, we address these questions by investigating the representations formed by LLMs during an in-context concept inference task. We found that LLMs can flexibly derive concepts from linguistic descriptions in relation to contextual cues about other concepts. The derived representations converge toward a shared, context-independent structure, and alignment with this structure reliably predicts model performance across various understanding and reasoning tasks. Moreover, the convergent representations effectively capture human behavioral judgments and closely align with neural activity patterns in the human brain, providing evidence for biological plausibility. Together, these findings establish that structured, human-like conceptual representations can emerge purely from language prediction without real-world grounding, highlighting the role of conceptual structure in understanding intelligent behavior. More broadly, our work suggests that LLMs offer a tangible window into the nature of human concepts and lays the groundwork for advancing alignment between artificial and human intelligence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks through example-based prompts without requiring parameter updates. However, understanding how tasks are internally encoded and generalized remains a challenge. To address some of the empirical and technical gaps in the literature, we introduce an automated formulation for encoding task information in ICL prompts as a function of attention heads within the transformer architecture. This approach computes a single task vector as a weighted sum of attention heads, with the weights optimized causally via gradient descent. Our findings show that existing methods fail to generalize effectively to modalities beyond text. In response, we also design a benchmark to evaluate whether a task vector can preserve task fidelity in functional regression tasks. The proposed method successfully extracts task-specific information from in-context demonstrations and excels in both text and regression tasks, demonstrating its generalizability across modalities.

Abstract: The tendency of users to anthropomorphise large language models (LLMs) is of growing interest to AI developers, researchers, and policy-makers. Here, we present a novel method for empirically evaluating anthropomorphic LLM behaviours in realistic and varied settings. Going beyond single-turn static benchmarks, we contribute three methodological advances in state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM evaluation. First, we develop a multi-turn evaluation of 14 anthropomorphic behaviours. Second, we present a scalable, automated approach by employing simulations of user interactions. Third, we conduct an interactive, large-scale human subject study (N=1101) to validate that the model behaviours we measure predict real users' anthropomorphic perceptions. We find that all SOTA LLMs evaluated exhibit similar behaviours, characterised by relationship-building (e.g., empathy and validation) and first-person pronoun use, and that the majority of behaviours only first occur after multiple turns. Our work lays an empirical foundation for investigating how design choices influence anthropomorphic model behaviours and for progressing the ethical debate on the desirability of these behaviours. It also showcases the necessity of multi-turn evaluations for complex social phenomena in human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Zero-shot LLMs are now also used for textual classification tasks, e.g., sentiment and bias detection in a sentence or article. However, their performance can be suboptimal in such data annotation tasks. We introduce a novel technique that evaluates an LLM's confidence for classifying a textual input by leveraging Metamorphic Relations (MRs). The MRs generate semantically equivalent yet textually divergent versions of the input. Following the principles of Metamorphic Testing (MT), the mutated versions are expected to have annotation labels similar to the input. By analyzing the consistency of an LLM's responses across these variations, we compute a perceived confidence score (PCS) based on the frequency of the predicted labels. PCS can be used for both single and multiple LLM settings (e.g., when multiple LLMs are vetted in a majority-voting setup). Empirical evaluation shows that our PCS-based approach improves the performance of zero-shot LLMs by 9.3% in textual classification tasks. When multiple LLMs are used in a majority-voting setup, we obtain a performance boost of 5.8% with PCS.

Abstract: Compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into task-specific Small Language Models (SLMs) encounters two significant challenges: safeguarding domain-specific knowledge privacy and managing limited resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose PPC-GPT, a novel unified framework that systematically addresses both privacy preservation and model compression in federated settings. PPC-GPT works on a server-client federated architecture, where the client sends differentially private (DP) perturbed task-specific data to the server's LLM. The LLM then generates synthetic data along with their corresponding rationales. This synthetic data is subsequently used for both LLM pruning and retraining processes. Our framework's key innovation lies in its holistic integration of privacy-preserving mechanisms, synthetic data generation, and task-specific compression techniques, creating unique benefits through component interaction. Our experiments across diverse text generation tasks demonstrate that PPC-GPT successfully achieves dual objectives: maintaining competitive performance comparable to full-sized LLMs while ensuring robust privacy protection through its federated architecture. Our code has been contributed to the FATE open-source project and is now publicly accessible at \textit{https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE-LLM/tree/main/python/fate_llm/algo/ppc-gpt}

<title>KVLink: Accelerating Large Language Models via Efficient KV Cache Reuse</title>

Abstract: We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we investigate a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse. Additionally, KVLink can be combined with KV cache compression to further save cache loading and storage overhead while outperforming the baselines.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs) to ensure accurate and coherent inference. However, LLMs struggle with reasoning order variations and fail to generalize across logically equivalent transformations. LLMs often rely on fixed sequential patterns rather than true logical understanding. To address this issue, we introduce an order-centric data augmentation framework based on commutativity in logical reasoning. We first randomly shuffle independent premises to introduce condition order augmentation. For reasoning steps, we construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model dependencies between steps, which allows us to identify valid reorderings of steps while preserving logical correctness. By leveraging order-centric augmentations, models can develop a more flexible and generalized reasoning process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments across multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that our method significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning performance and adaptability to diverse logical structures. We release our codes and augmented data in https://github.com/qianxiHe147/Order-Centric-Data-Augmentation.

Abstract: To achieve equitable performance across languages, large language models (LLMs) must be able to abstract knowledge beyond the language in which it was learnt. However, the current literature lacks reliable ways to measure LLMs' capability of such cross-lingual knowledge transfer. To that end, we present ECLeKTic, a multilingual closed-book QA dataset that Evaluates Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer in a simple, black-box manner. Concretely, we used the presence and absence of Wikipedia articles in 12 languages to detect pieces of information that were likely available during pre-training in one of the languages but not in the others. We curate ECLeKTic as a set of fact-seeking questions over this kind of information, in all the different languages. Therefore, in order to solve ECLeKTic the model is required to transfer knowledge between languages. We evaluated 8 LLMs and showed that current SOTA models struggle to effectively share knowledge across languages, even if they can predict the answer for questions in the language in which the knowledge was acquired.

Abstract: Gaps arise between a language model's use of concepts and people's expectations. This gap is critical when LLMs generate text to help people communicate via Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) tools. In this work, we introduce the evaluation task of Representation Alignment for measuring this gap via human judgment. In our study, we expand keywords and emotion representations into full sentences. We select four emotion representations: Words, Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensions expressed in both Lexical and Numeric forms, and Emojis. In addition to Representation Alignment, we also measure people's judgments of the accuracy and realism of the generated sentences. While representations like VAD break emotions into easy-to-compute components, our findings show that people agree more with how LLMs generate when conditioned on English words (e.g., "angry") rather than VAD scales. This difference is especially visible when comparing Numeric VAD to words. Furthermore, we found that the perception of how much a generated sentence conveys an emotion is dependent on both the representation type and which emotion it is.

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling of large language models (LLMs), exemplified by DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o1, show that extending the chain of thought during inference can significantly improve general reasoning performance. However, the impact of this paradigm on legal reasoning remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of 12 LLMs, including both reasoning-focused and general-purpose models, across 17 Chinese and English legal tasks spanning statutory and case-law traditions. In addition, we curate a bilingual chain-of-thought dataset for legal reasoning through distillation from DeepSeek-R1 and develop Legal-R1, an open-source model specialized for the legal domain. Experimental results show that Legal-R1 delivers competitive performance across diverse tasks. DeepSeek-R1 exhibits clear advantages in Chinese legal reasoning, while OpenAI's o1 achieves comparable results on English tasks. We further conduct a detailed error analysis, which reveals recurring issues such as outdated legal knowledge, limited capacity for legal interpretation, and susceptibility to factual hallucinations. These findings delineate the main obstacles confronting legal-domain LLMs and suggest promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong performance in multilingual question-answering (QA) tasks by leveraging relevant passages retrieved from corpora. In multilingual RAG (mRAG), the retrieved passages can be written in languages other than that of the query entered by the user, making it challenging for LLMs to effectively utilize the provided information. Recent research suggests that retrieving passages from multilingual corpora can improve RAG performance, particularly for low-resource languages. However, the extent to which LLMs can leverage different kinds of multilingual contexts to generate accurate answers, *independently from retrieval quality*, remains understudied. In this paper, we conduct an extensive assessment of LLMs' ability to (i) make consistent use of a relevant passage regardless of its language, (ii) respond in the expected language, and (iii) focus on the relevant passage even when multiple `distracting' passages in different languages are provided in the context. Our experiments with four LLMs across three QA datasets covering a total of 48 languages reveal a surprising ability of LLMs to extract the relevant information from passages in a different language than the query, but a much weaker ability to formulate a full answer in the correct language. Our analysis, based on both accuracy and feature attribution techniques, further shows that distracting passages negatively impact answer quality regardless of their language. However, distractors in the query language exert a slightly stronger influence. Taken together, our findings deepen the understanding of how LLMs utilize context in mRAG systems, providing directions for future improvements.

Abstract: Post-training is essential for the success of large language models (LLMs), transforming pre-trained base models into more useful and aligned post-trained models. While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HZD01/post-training-mechanistic-analysis.

Abstract: The collaborative paradigm of large and small language models (LMs) effectively balances performance and cost, yet its pivotal challenge lies in precisely pinpointing the moment of invocation when hallucinations arise in small LMs. Previous optimization efforts primarily focused on post-processing techniques, which were separate from the reasoning process of LMs, resulting in high computational costs and limited effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a practical invocation evaluation metric called AttenHScore, which calculates the accumulation and propagation of hallucinations during the generation process of small LMs, continuously amplifying potential reasoning errors. By dynamically adjusting the detection threshold, we achieve more accurate real-time invocation of large LMs. Additionally, considering the limited reasoning capacity of small LMs, we leverage uncertainty-aware knowledge reorganization to assist them better capture critical information from different text chunks. Extensive experiments reveal that our AttenHScore outperforms most baselines in enhancing real-time hallucination detection capabilities across multiple QA datasets, especially when addressing complex queries. Moreover, our strategies eliminate the need for additional model training and display flexibility in adapting to various transformer-based LMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce factoid hallucinations - plausible yet incorrect answers. A common mitigation strategy is model alignment, which improves factual accuracy by training on curated (factual, non-factual) pairs. However, this approach often relies on a stronger model (e.g., GPT-4) or an external knowledge base to assess factual correctness that may not always be accessible. Addressing this, we propose Atomic Consistency Preference Optimization (ACPO), a self-supervised preference-tuning method that enhances factual accuracy without external supervision. ACPO leverages atomic consistency signals (i.e., the agreement of individual facts across multiple stochastic responses) to identify high- and low-quality data pairs for model alignment. Despite being fully self-supervised, ACPO outperforms the strong supervised alignment baseline by 1.95 points averaged across Phi-3 and Llama3 on the LongFact and BioGen datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving factual reliability without relying on external models or knowledge bases.

Abstract: Multimodal models play a key role in empathy detection, but their performance can suffer when modalities provide conflicting cues. To understand these failures, we examine cases where unimodal and multimodal predictions diverge. Using fine-tuned models for text, audio, and video, along with a gated fusion model, we find that such disagreements often reflect underlying ambiguity, as evidenced by annotator uncertainty. Our analysis shows that dominant signals in one modality can mislead fusion when unsupported by others. We also observe that humans, like models, do not consistently benefit from multimodal input. These insights position disagreement as a useful diagnostic signal for identifying challenging examples and improving empathy system robustness.

Abstract: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of psychological abuse that poses serious threats to mental health. Nevertheless, detecting mental manipulation remains a largely underexplored research problem. The field faces three major challenges: (i) insufficient and hard-to-obtain training data; (ii) the covert nature of mental manipulation, which hinders detection; and (iii) the lack of real-world datasets. To address these challenges, we propose MentalMAC, a novel framework that enhances large language models' ability to detect elements of mental manipulation in multi-turn dialogue. Our approach consists of three key components: EvoSA, an annotation-free data augmentation method based on evolutionary operations and speech act theory; teacher-model-generated multi-task supervision; and progressive task-level anti-curriculum distillation. We then constructed the ReaMent dataset, comprising 5,000 real-world dialogue samples, utilizing MentalMAC-distilled models to aid in human annotation. Vast experiments show that MentalMAC achieves up to 25.9% improvement in F1mac and 8.1% in accuracy over the best-performing baseline, outperforming commercial LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet.

<title>Language Model Distillation: A Temporal Difference Imitation Learning Perspective</title>

Abstract: Large language models have led to significant progress across many NLP tasks, although their massive sizes often incur substantial computational costs. Distillation has become a common practice to compress these large and highly capable models into smaller, more efficient ones. Many existing language model distillation methods can be viewed as behavior cloning from the perspective of imitation learning or inverse reinforcement learning. This viewpoint has inspired subsequent studies that leverage (inverse) reinforcement learning techniques, including variations of behavior cloning and temporal difference learning methods. Rather than proposing yet another specific temporal difference method, we introduce a general framework for temporal difference-based distillation by exploiting the distributional sparsity of the teacher model. Specifically, it is often observed that language models assign most probability mass to a small subset of tokens. Motivated by this observation, we design a temporal difference learning framework that operates on a reduced action space (a subset of vocabulary), and demonstrate how practical algorithms can be derived and the resulting performance improvements.

Abstract: In recent years, protein-text models have gained significant attention for their potential in protein generation and understanding. Current approaches focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a novel evaluation framework based on biological entities. Motivated by our observation, we propose a retrieval-enhanced method, which significantly outperforms fine-tuned LLMs for protein-to-text generation and shows accuracy and efficiency in training-free scenarios. Our code and data can be seen at https://github.com/IDEA-XL/RAPM.

Abstract: Information seeking demands iterative evidence gathering and reflective reasoning, yet large language models (LLMs) still struggle with it in open-web question answering. Existing prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods remain fixed by prompt rules or training corpora, and are usually benchmarked only on well-structured wiki sources, limiting real-world adaptability. We introduce WebPuzzle, a 24k-sample training and 275-sample test benchmark that evaluates information seeking on the live internet, across both wiki and open-domain queries. Leveraging 7k WebPuzzle instances, we develop DeepDiver, a reinforcement-learning (RL) framework that cultivates Search Intensity Scaling (SIS)-an emergent ability to escalate search frequency and depth instead of settling on overconfident, under-evidenced answers. With SIS, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Pangu-7B-Reasoner attain performance on real-web tasks comparable to the 671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1. We detail DeepDiver's curriculum from cold-start SFT to a well designed RL procedure, and show that its seeking policy generalized from closed-ended queries to open-ended generation such as long-form writing. Our results advance adaptive information seeking in LLMs and provide a rigorous benchmark for future work.

<title>When Language Shapes Thought: Cross-Lingual Transfer of Factual Knowledge in Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for cross-lingual information access, yet their use of factual knowledge remains highly sensitive to the input language. Prior work has addressed this through English prompting and evaluation, assuming that English-based reasoning is universally beneficial. In this work, we challenge that assumption by exploring factual knowledge transfer from non-English to English through the lens of Language and Thought Theory. We introduce Language-to-Thought (L2T) prompting, which aligns the model's internal ''thinking'' language with the source of knowledge. Across three languages and four models, L2T consistently outperforms English-based reasoning, reversing the expected advantage of English prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/GeomeunByeol/Language2Thought.

<title>LegalEval-Q: A New Benchmark for The Quality Evaluation of LLM-Generated Legal Text</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in legal applications, current evaluation benchmarks tend to focus mainly on factual accuracy while largely neglecting important linguistic quality aspects such as clarity, coherence, and terminology. To address this gap, we propose three steps: First, we develop a regression model to evaluate the quality of legal texts based on clarity, coherence, and terminology. Second, we create a specialized set of legal questions. Third, we analyze 49 LLMs using this evaluation framework.
  Our analysis identifies three key findings: First, model quality levels off at 14 billion parameters, with only a marginal improvement of $2.7\%$ noted at 72 billion parameters. Second, engineering choices such as quantization and context length have a negligible impact, as indicated by statistical significance thresholds above 0.016. Third, reasoning models consistently outperform base architectures. A significant outcome of our research is the release of a ranking list and Pareto analysis, which highlight the Qwen3 series as the optimal choice for cost-performance tradeoffs. This work not only establishes standardized evaluation protocols for legal LLMs but also uncovers fundamental limitations in current training data refinement approaches. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/lyxx3rd/LegalEval-Q.

<title>OpenUnlearning: Accelerating LLM Unlearning via Unified Benchmarking of Methods and Metrics</title>

Abstract: Robust unlearning is crucial for safely deploying large language models (LLMs) in environments where data privacy, model safety, and regulatory compliance must be ensured. Yet the task is inherently challenging, partly due to difficulties in reliably measuring whether unlearning has truly occurred. Moreover, fragmentation in current methodologies and inconsistent evaluation metrics hinder comparative analysis and reproducibility. To unify and accelerate research efforts, we introduce OpenUnlearning, a standardized and extensible framework designed explicitly for benchmarking both LLM unlearning methods and metrics. OpenUnlearning integrates 13 unlearning algorithms and 16 diverse evaluations across 3 leading benchmarks (TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP) and also enables analyses of forgetting behaviors across 450+ checkpoints we publicly release. Leveraging OpenUnlearning, we propose a novel meta-evaluation benchmark focused specifically on assessing the faithfulness and robustness of evaluation metrics themselves. We also benchmark diverse unlearning methods and provide a comparative analysis against an extensive evaluation suite. Overall, we establish a clear, community-driven pathway toward rigorous development in LLM unlearning research.

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation is a central goal in reinforcement learning (RL). Despite recent advances in enhancing large language model (LLM) reasoning, most methods lean toward exploitation, and increasingly encounter performance plateaus. In this work, we revisit entropy -- a signal of exploration in RL -- and examine its relationship to exploratory reasoning in LLMs. Through empirical analysis, we uncover positive correlations between high-entropy regions and three types of exploratory reasoning actions: (1) pivotal tokens that determine or connect logical steps, (2) reflective actions such as self-verification and correction, and (3) rare behaviors under-explored by the base LLMs. Motivated by this, we introduce a minimal modification to standard RL with only one line of code: augmenting the advantage function with an entropy-based term. Unlike traditional maximum-entropy methods which encourage exploration by promoting uncertainty, we encourage exploration by promoting longer and deeper reasoning chains. Notably, our method achieves significant gains on the Pass@K metric -- an upper-bound estimator of LLM reasoning capabilities -- even when evaluated with extremely large K values, pushing the boundaries of LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a robust mastery of syntax when processing and generating text. While this suggests internalized understanding of hierarchical syntax and dependency relations, the precise mechanism by which they represent syntactic structure is an open area within interpretability research. Probing provides one way to identify the mechanism of syntax being linearly encoded in activations, however, no comprehensive study has yet established whether a model's probing accuracy reliably predicts its downstream syntactic performance. Adopting a "mechanisms vs. outcomes" framework, we evaluate 32 open-weight transformer models and find that syntactic features extracted via probing fail to predict outcomes of targeted syntax evaluations across English linguistic phenomena. Our results highlight a substantial disconnect between latent syntactic representations found via probing and observable syntactic behaviors in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ReCode.

<title>DP-Fusion: Token-Level Differentially Private Inference for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) do not preserve privacy at inference-time. The LLM's outputs can inadvertently reveal information about the model's context, which presents a privacy challenge when the LLM is augmented via tools or databases containing sensitive information. Existing privacy-preserving methods at inference-time have significant limitations since they (i) lack provable guarantees or (ii) have a poor utility/privacy trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a Differentially Private Inference (DPI) mechanism for LLMs that provably bounds the influence a set of tokens in the context can have on the LLM's output. DP-Fusion works as follows: (1) label a subset of sensitive tokens, (2) infer the LLM without any sensitive tokens to obtain a baseline, (3) infer the LLM with the sensitive tokens, and (4) blend distributions so that the final output remains within a bounded distance of the baseline distribution. While this per-token influence bound also mitigates jailbreak-style prompt injection, we focus on \emph{document privatization}, where the goal is to paraphrase a document containing sensitive tokens, e.g., personally identifiable information, so that no attacker can reliably infer them from the paraphrased document while preserving high text quality. The privacy/utility trade-off is controlled by $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon=0$ hides sensitive tokens entirely, while higher values trade off privacy for improved text quality. We show that our method creates token-level provably privatized documents with substantially improved theoretical and empirical privacy, achieving $6\times$ lower perplexity than related DPI methods.

ECom-Bench features dynamic user simulation based on persona information collected from real e-commerce customer interactions and a realistic task dataset derived from authentic e-commerce dialogues. These tasks, covering a wide range of business scenarios, are designed to reflect real-world complexities, making ECom-Bench highly challenging. For instance, even advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only a 10-20% pass^3 metric in our benchmark, highlighting the substantial difficulties posed by complex e-commerce scenarios. The code and data have been made publicly available at https://github.com/XiaoduoAILab/ECom-Bench to facilitate further research and development in this domain.

Abstract: We investigate the abilities of 28 Large language Models (LLMs) to reason about cardinal directions (CDs) using a benchmark generated from a set of templates, extensively testing an LLM's ability to determine the correct CD given a particular scenario. The templates allow for a number of degrees of variation such as means of locomotion of the agent involved, and whether set in the first, second or third person. Even the newer Large Reasoning Models are unable to reliably determine the correct CD for all questions. This paper summarises and extends earlier work presented at COSIT-24.

<title>EMBRACE: Shaping Inclusive Opinion Representation by Aligning Implicit Conversations with Social Norms</title>

Abstract: Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair participation and reflections of values is at the core of many conversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface inclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social groups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion embedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can exacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations in model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable inclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the stance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to evaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by introducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often overlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and discourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the underlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of diverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i) positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii) instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through this, we provide a principled and structured lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer a pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs. To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of correction-based supervision.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Dataset-v3, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-8B-v3 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. Furthermore, we show our moderately multilingual fine-tuning enables robust cross-lingual transfer and strong zero-shot generalization to unseen languages. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work advances multilingual LLM safety by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines, defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of 1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing, unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally, LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human judgments of creativity.

Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs (PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.

Abstract: The relationship between tokenizer algorithm (e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), Unigram), morphological alignment, tokenization quality (e.g., compression efficiency), and downstream performance remains largely unclear, particularly for languages with complex morphology. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of tokenizers using small-sized BERT models -- from pre-training through fine-tuning -- for Telugu (agglutinative), along with preliminary evaluation in Hindi (primarily fusional with some agglutination) and English (fusional). To evaluate morphological alignment of tokenizers in Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600 derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal two key findings for Telugu. First, the choice of tokenizer algorithm is the most significant factor influencing performance, with Unigram-based tokenizers consistently outperforming BPE across most settings. Second, while better morphological alignment shows a moderate, positive correlation with performance on text classification and structure prediction tasks, its impact is secondary to the tokenizer algorithm. Notably, hybrid approaches that use morphological information for pre-segmentation significantly boost the performance of BPE, though not Unigram. Our results further showcase the need for comprehensive intrinsic evaluation metrics for tokenizers that could explain downstream performance trends consistently.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training. While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data. Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews, our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to 71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support. When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks, it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant margin.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias(ADRD) affect nearly five million older adults in the United States, yet more than half remain undiagnosed. Speech-based natural language processing(NLP) offers a scalable approach for detecting early cognitive decline through subtle linguistic markers that may precede clinical diagnosis. This study develops and evaluates a speech-based screening pipeline integrating transformer embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, synthetic augmentation using large language models(LLMs), and benchmarking of unimodal and multimodal classifiers. External validation assessed generalizability to a MCI-only cohort.
  Transcripts were drawn from the ADReSSo 2021 benchmark dataset(n=237, Pitt Corpus) and the DementiaBank Delaware corpus(n=205, MCI vs. controls). Ten transformer models were tested under three fine-tuning strategies. A late-fusion model combined embeddings from the top transformer with 110 linguistic features. Five LLMs(LLaMA8B/70B, MedAlpaca7B, Ministral8B,GPT-4o) generated label-conditioned synthetic speech for augmentation, and three multimodal LLMs(GPT-4o,Qwen-Omni,Phi-4) were evaluated in zero-shot and fine-tuned modes. On ADReSSo, the fusion model achieved F1=83.3(AUC=89.5), outperforming transformer-only and linguistic baselines. MedAlpaca7B augmentation(2x) improved F1=85.7, though larger scales reduced gains. Fine-tuning boosted unimodal LLMs(MedAlpaca7B F1=47.7=>78.7), while multimodal models performed lower (Phi-4=71.6;GPT-4o=67.6). On Delaware, the fusion plus 1x MedAlpaca7B model achieved F1=72.8(AUC=69.6). Integrating transformer and linguistic features enhances ADRD detection. LLM-based augmentation improves data efficiency but yields diminishing returns, while current multimodal models remain limited. Validation on an independent MCI cohort supports the pipeline's potential for scalable, clinically relevant early screening.

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning over extended context and its high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods could fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition on reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global context comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm towards retrieval-based stateful reasoning. Our framework is made publicly available at https://github.com/EternityJune25/ComoRAG.

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88 teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 14 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations. Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection, revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors. This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at https://e-m-n-l-p.github.io/.

<title>GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains, their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline \textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of ``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs, including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods. Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset, and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of normality. Its core argument is that the Turing test is a test of normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test requires machines to "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of multiple judges. Its conclusions are twofold. First, it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence, insofar as they deviate from the original goal of Turing for the modeling of artificial minds. Second, it argues that the objectivization of normal human behavior in the Turing test fails due to the game configuration of the test which ends up objectivizing normative ideals of normal behavior rather than normal behavior per se.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed across diverse applications. This often includes tasks LLMs have not encountered during training. This implies that enumerating and obtaining the high-quality training data for all tasks is infeasible. Thus, we often need to rely on transfer learning using datasets with different characteristics, and anticipate out-of-distribution requests. Motivated by this practical need, we propose an analysis framework, building a transfer learning matrix and dimensionality reduction, to dissect these cross-task interactions. We train and analyze 10 models to identify latent abilities (e.g., Reasoning, Sentiment Classification, NLU, Arithmetic) and discover the side effects of the transfer learning. Our findings reveal that performance improvements often defy explanations based on surface-level dataset similarity or source data quality. Instead, hidden statistical factors of the source dataset, such as class distribution and generation length proclivities, alongside specific linguistic features, are actually more influential. This work offers insights into the complex dynamics of transfer learning, paving the way for more predictable and effective LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Recent trends in NLP aim to improve reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), with key focus on generalization and robustness to variations in tasks. Counterfactual task variants introduce minimal but semantically meaningful changes to otherwise valid first-order logic (FOL) problem instances altering a single predicate or swapping roles of constants to probe whether a reasoning system can maintain logical consistency under perturbation. Previous studies showed that LLMs becomes brittle on counterfactual variations, suggesting that they often rely on spurious surface patterns to generate responses. In this work, we explore if a neurosymbolic (NS) approach that integrates an LLM and a symbolic logical solver could mitigate this problem. Experiments across LLMs of varying sizes show that NS methods are more robust but perform worse overall that purely neural methods. We then propose NSCoT that combines an NS method and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and demonstrate that while it improves performance, NSCoT still lags behind standard CoT. Our analysis opens research directions for future work.

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis, effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent innovations, particularly multimodal large language models, have shown improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO, a mixed-policy reinforcement learning algorithm designed specifically to optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B, EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4\% in clinical metrics across four major datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9\% on unseen datasets.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures, enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/LinearRAG.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality can be decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy, proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language models but suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learned updates interfere with the dominant singular directions that encode essential pre-trained knowledge. We propose Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA), a theoretically grounded approach that prevents this interference through double-sided orthogonal projections. By decomposing frozen weights via SVD, OPLoRA constrains LoRA updates to lie entirely within the orthogonal complement of the top-$k$ singular subspace using projections $P_L = I - U_k U_k^\top$ and $P_R = I - V_k V_k^\top$. We prove that this construction exactly preserves the top-$k$ singular triples, providing mathematical guarantees for knowledge retention. To quantify subspace interference, we introduce $\rho_k$, a metric measuring update alignment with dominant directions. Extensive experiments across commonsense reasoning, mathematics, and code generation demonstrate that OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive task-specific performance on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen2.5 7B, establishing orthogonal projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache, which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned, special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation. Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free compression techniques.

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise) ontology extraction.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a standard way to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially. While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g., FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed top frequent subset of the target model's vocabulary. Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. Across standard speculative decoding benchmarks, DynaSpec delivers consistent improvements in mean accepted length, for Llama-3-8B, reaching upto 98.2% of full-vocabulary performance, while fixed-shortlist baselines attain only 84.4%. By leveraging context-dependent selection, DynaSpec achieves up to a 2.18 times increase in generated tokens compared to 1.91 times for fixed-vocabulary approaches.

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii) PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home, office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often struggle in real-world environments, where ambient noise severely degrades their performance. This paper explores a novel approach that exploits prior knowledge of testing environments to maximize SER performance under noisy conditions. To address this task, we propose a text-guided, environment-aware training where an SER model is trained with contaminated speech samples and their paired noise description. We use a pre-trained text encoder to extract the text-based environment embedding and then fuse it to a transformer-based SER model during training and inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through our experiment with the MSP-Podcast corpus and real-world additive noise samples collected from the Freesound and DEMAND repositories. Our experiment indicates that the text-based environment descriptions processed by a large language model (LLM) produce representations that improve the noise-robustness of the SER system. With a contrastive learning (CL)-based representation, our proposed method can be improved by jointly fine-tuning the text encoder with the emotion recognition model. Under the -5dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level, fine-tuning the text encoder improves our CL-based representation method by 76.4% (arousal), 100.0% (dominance), and 27.7% (valence).

Abstract: The post-training of LLMs, which typically consists of the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and the preference learning stage (RLHF or DPO), is crucial to effective and safe LLM applications. The widely adopted approach in post-training popular open-source LLMs is to sequentially perform SFT and RLHF/DPO. However, this is suboptimal in terms of SFT and RLHF/DPO trade-off: the LLM gradually forgets about the first stage's training when undergoing the second stage's training. This sequential paradigm persists largely due to its simplicity and modularity, which make it easier to implement and manage at scale despite its limitations. We theoretically prove the sub-optimality of sequential post-training and propose a practical joint post-training framework which has theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically outperforms sequential post-training framework, with up to 23% overall performance improvement across multiple LLM evaluation benchmarks, while having minimal computational overhead.

<title>Zeroth-Order Adaptive Neuron Alignment Based Pruning without Re-Training</title>

Abstract: Network pruning focuses on algorithms that aim to reduce a given model's computational cost by removing a subset of its parameters while having minimal impact on performance. Throughout the last decade, the most widely used pruning paradigm has been pruning and re-training, which nowadays is inconvenient due to the vast amount of pre-trained models, which are, in any case, too expensive to re-train. In this paper, we exploit functional information from dense pre-trained models, i.e., their input activations, to obtain sparse models that maximize the activations' alignment with respect to their corresponding dense models. Hence, we propose \textbf{NeuroAl}, a \emph{top-up} algorithm that can be used on top of any given pruning algorithm for LLMs, which modifies the block-wise and row-wise sparsity, exploiting information from both the dense model and its sparse version to maximize the \emph{neuron alignment} among activations. Different from existing methods, our approach adaptively selects the best hyperparameters for the block-wise and row-wise sparsity ratios w.r.t. the model and the desired sparsity, and requires \emph{no re-training}. We test our method over $\sim$300 test cases with four LLM families, three sparsity ratios, and ten language tasks (three language modeling and seven zero-shot datasets), showing how it consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance-runtime trade-off.

Abstract: Peer review, as a cornerstone of scientific research, ensures the integrity and quality of scholarly work by providing authors with objective feedback for refinement. However, in the traditional peer review process, authors often receive vague or insufficiently detailed feedback, which provides limited assistance and leads to a more time-consuming review cycle. If authors can identify some specific weaknesses in their paper, they can not only address the reviewer's concerns but also improve their work. This raises the critical question of how to enhance authors' comprehension of review comments. In this paper, we present SEAGraph, a novel framework developed to clarify review comments by uncovering the underlying intentions behind them. We construct two types of graphs for each paper: the semantic mind graph, which captures the authors' thought process, and the hierarchical background graph, which delineates the research domains related to the paper. A retrieval method is then designed to extract relevant content from both graphs, facilitating coherent explanations for the review comments. Extensive experiments show that SEAGraph excels in review comment understanding tasks, offering significant benefits to authors. By bridging the gap between reviewers' critiques and authors' comprehension, SEAGraph contributes to a more efficient, transparent and collaborative scientific publishing ecosystem.

Abstract: Language models, while capable of generating remarkably coherent and seemingly accurate text, can occasionally produce undesirable content, including harmful or toxic outputs. In this paper, we present a new two-stage approach to detect and mitigate undesirable content generations by rectifying activations. First, we train an ensemble of layerwise classifiers to detect undesirable content using activations by minimizing a smooth surrogate of the risk-aware score. Then, for detected undesirable contents, we propose layerwise distributional steering policies that transform the attention heads. These policies are computed through principled semidefinite programming, which aims to minimally perturb the attention distribution while probabilistically guaranteeing the effectiveness of the editions. Empirical evaluations across multiple language models and datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in reducing the generation of undesirable output.

<title>Continual Pre-training of MoEs: How robust is your router?</title>

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers are promising architectures for foundation models. Compared to dense transformers that require the same amount of floating-point operations (FLOPs) per forward pass, MoEs benefit from improved sample efficiency at training time and achieve much stronger performance. Many closed-source and open-source frontier language models have thus adopted an MoE architecture. Naturally, practitioners will want to extend the capabilities of these models with large amounts of newly collected data without completely re-training them. Prior work has shown that a simple combination of replay, learning rate re-warming, and re-decaying can enable the continual pre-training (CPT) of dense decoder-only transformers with minimal performance degradation compared to full re-training. In the case of decoder-only MoE transformers, however, it is unclear how the routing algorithm will impact continual pre-training performance: 1) do the MoE transformer's routers exacerbate forgetting relative to a dense model?; 2) do the routers maintain a balanced load on previous distributions after CPT?; 3) are the same strategies applied to dense models sufficient to continually pre-train MoE LLMs? In what follows, we conduct a large-scale study training a 500M parameter dense transformer and four 500M-active/2B-total parameter MoE transformers. Each model is trained for 600B tokens. Our results establish a surprising robustness to distribution shifts for MoEs using both Sinkhorn-Balanced and Z-and-Aux-loss-balanced routing algorithms, even in MoEs continually pre-trained without replay. Moreover, we show that MoE LLMs maintain their sample efficiency (relative to a FLOP-matched dense model) during CPT and that they can match the performance of a fully re-trained MoE at a fraction of the cost.

Abstract: Color plays an important role in human perception and usually provides critical clues in visual reasoning. However, it is unclear whether and how vision-language models (VLMs) can perceive, understand, and leverage color as humans. This paper introduces ColorBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to assess the capabilities of VLMs in color understanding, including color perception, reasoning, and robustness. By curating a suite of diverse test scenarios, with grounding in real applications, ColorBench evaluates how these models perceive colors, infer meanings from color-based cues, and maintain consistent performance under varying color transformations. Through an extensive evaluation of 32 VLMs with varying language models and vision encoders, our paper reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) The scaling law (larger models are better) still holds on ColorBench, while the language model plays a more important role than the vision encoder. (ii) However, the performance gaps across models are relatively small, indicating that color understanding has been largely neglected by existing VLMs. (iii) CoT reasoning improves color understanding accuracies and robustness, though they are vision-centric tasks. (iv) Color clues are indeed leveraged by VLMs on ColorBench but they can also mislead models in some tasks. These findings highlight the critical limitations of current VLMs and underscore the need to enhance color comprehension. Our ColorBenchcan serve as a foundational tool for advancing the study of human-level color understanding of multimodal AI.

Abstract: Data preparation (DP) transforms raw data into a form suitable for downstream applications, typically by composing operations into executable pipelines. Building such pipelines is time-consuming and requires sophisticated programming skills, posing a significant barrier for non-experts. To lower this barrier, we introduce Text-to-Pipeline, a new task that translates NL data preparation instructions into DP pipelines, and PARROT, a large-scale benchmark to support systematic evaluation. To ensure realistic DP scenarios, PARROT is built by mining transformation patterns from production pipelines and instantiating them on 23,009 real-world tables, resulting in ~18,000 tasks spanning 16 core operators. Our empirical evaluation on PARROT reveals a critical failure mode in cutting-edge LLMs: they struggle not only with multi-step compositional logic but also with semantic parameter grounding. We thus establish a strong baseline with Pipeline-Agent, an execution-aware agent that iteratively reflects on intermediate states. While it achieves state-of-the-art performance, a significant gap remains, underscoring the deep, unsolved challenges for PARROT. It provides the essential, large-scale testbed for developing and evaluating the next generation of autonomous data preparation agentic systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-chain-of-thought reasoning models via scaling reinforcement learning (RL), its underlying training dynamics remain poorly understood, and several counterintuitive behaviors persist. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in scaling RL, revealing that positive samples mainly facilitate precise fitting to the training data, whereas negative samples significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, while positive samples are essential for convergence in the zero-RL setting, training on negative samples alone suffices to attain strong reasoning performance and even better generalization in cold-start scenarios. (2) We identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization, where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we explore two strategies, including relative length rewards and offline sample injection, to leverage these data better and enhance reasoning efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that greedy decoding can distort evaluation by flipping the correctness of responses.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to unintended out-of-distribution generalization. Standard approaches to this problem rely on modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks, including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions. Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall, CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without modifying training data.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful solution for dealing with complex problems across diverse domains. The effectiveness of MAS is critically dependent on its collaboration topology, which has become a focal point for automated design research. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on a template graph modification paradigm with a predefined set of agents and hard-coded interaction structures, significantly limiting their adaptability to task-specific requirements. To address these limitations, we reframe MAS design as a conditional autoregressive graph generation task, where both the system composition and structure are designed jointly. We propose ARG-Designer, a novel autoregressive model that operationalizes this paradigm by constructing the collaboration graph from scratch. Conditioned on a natural language task query, ARG-Designer sequentially and dynamically determines the required number of agents, selects their appropriate roles from an extensible pool, and establishes the optimal communication links between them. This generative approach creates a customized topology in a flexible and extensible manner, precisely tailored to the unique demands of different tasks. Extensive experiments across six diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ARG-Designer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also enjoys significantly greater token efficiency and enhanced extensibility. The source code of ARG-Designer is available at https://github.com/Shiy-Li/ARG-Designer.

Abstract: Realizing personalized medicine at scale calls for methods that distill insights from longitudinal patient journeys, which can be viewed as a sequence of medical events. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation and generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with medical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion encounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we introduce the Curiosity models, a family of decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing 115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the largest scaling-law study of medical event data, establishing a methodology for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute, tokens, and model size. Consequently, we pretrained a series of compute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a patient's real-world history, Curiosity autoregressively predicts the next medical event to simulate patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks, including diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations. Remarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based inference, Curiosity generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot examples. Curiosity's predictive power consistently improves as the model and pretraining scale. Our results show that Curiosity, a generative medical event foundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing an extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making, streamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation. Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment. These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models in generation.

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations. This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

arXiv:2510.06557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget. With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus. The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink. Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B) often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient, scalable reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted through parameter efficient fine tuning, but current release practices provide weak assurances about what data were used and how updates were computed. We present Verifiable Fine Tuning, a protocol and system that produces succinct zero knowledge proofs that a released model was obtained from a public initialization under a declared training program and an auditable dataset commitment. The approach combines five elements. First, commitments that bind data sources, preprocessing, licenses, and per epoch quota counters to a manifest. Second, a verifiable sampler that supports public replayable and private index hiding batch selection. Third, update circuits restricted to parameter efficient fine tuning that enforce AdamW style optimizer semantics and proof friendly approximations with explicit error budgets. Fourth, recursive aggregation that folds per step proofs into per epoch and end to end certificates with millisecond verification. Fifth, provenance binding and optional trusted execution property cards that attest code identity and constants. On English and bilingual instruction mixtures, the method maintains utility within tight budgets while achieving practical proof performance. Policy quotas are enforced with zero violations, and private sampling windows show no measurable index leakage. Federated experiments demonstrate that the system composes with probabilistic audits and bandwidth constraints. These results indicate that end to end verifiable fine tuning is feasible today for real parameter efficient pipelines, closing a critical trust gap for regulated and decentralized deployments.

Abstract: Reasoning over procedural sequences, where the order of steps directly impacts outcomes, is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). In this work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from shuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain where correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive evaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence alignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence (NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects of ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with increasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer procedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input, corresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in procedural reasoning, especially with longer and more disordered inputs.

<br />
Summary: ATLAS is an adaptive testing framework that uses Item Response Theory to estimate model ability by selecting benchmark items based on Fisher information. It reduces the number of items needed for evaluation by 90% while maintaining measurement precision. Analysis shows that a small percentage of benchmark items have negative discrimination, indicating annotation errors that can corrupt evaluation results. ATLAS allows for more efficient evaluation with lower item exposure rates and test overlap compared to static benchmarks where all models see all items. IRT rankings of models differ from accuracy rankings, with models having the same accuracy receiving different IRT scores and a significant percentage of models shifting rank positions. The framework provides code and calibrated item banks for easy implementation. <div>

Abstract: Large language model evaluation requires thousands of benchmark items, making evaluations expensive and slow. Existing methods compute average accuracy across fixed item sets, treating all items equally despite varying quality and informativeness. We present ATLAS an adaptive testing framework using Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate model ability through Fisher information-guided item selection. Our analysis of five major benchmarks reveals that 3-6% of items exhibit negative discrimination, indicating annotation errors that corrupt static evaluation. ATLAS achieves 90% item reduction while maintaining measurement precision: on HellaSwag (5,608 items), we match full-benchmark estimates using only 42 items with 0.154 MAE. Our framework maintains item exposure rates below 10% and test overlap at 16-27%, compared to static benchmarks where every model sees all items (100% exposure). Among 4,000+ tested models, IRT ranks differ from accuracy ranks: models with the same accuracy get different IRT scores, and 23-31% of all models shift by more than 10 rank positions. Code and calibrated item banks are available at https://github.com/Peiyu-Georgia-Li/ATLAS.git.

<div> Keywords: fake news detection, sentiment information, user roles, deep clustering, SARC

Summary: <br /><br /> Fake news detection in social networks has been a significant research focus, with recent studies highlighting the importance of incorporating sentiment information from both news content and user comments for improved performance. However, existing approaches often overlook role differentiation, where the same sentiment polarity can come from users with different roles, limiting their ability to capture nuanced patterns. To address this issue, the proposed Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering (SARC) framework utilizes sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for better fake news detection. By generating user features through joint comment text representation and sentiment encoding, SARC constructs a deep clustering module to categorize user roles and optimize dual objectives for role clustering and fake news detection simultaneously. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that SARC outperforms baseline models in all metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing fake news detection. <div>

Abstract: Fake news detection has been a long-standing research focus in social networks. Recent studies suggest that incorporating sentiment information from both news content and user comments can enhance detection performance. However, existing approaches typically treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals, overlooking role differentiation, that is, the same sentiment polarity may originate from users with distinct roles, thereby limiting their ability to capture nuanced patterns for effective detection. To address this issue, we propose SARC, a Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering framework which utilizes sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for improved fake news detection. The framework first generates user features through joint comment text representation (with BiGRU and Attention mechanism) and sentiment encoding. It then constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to automatically categorize user roles. Finally, unlike existing approaches which take fake news label as the unique supervision signal, we propose a joint optimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection to further improve the model performance. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp, demonstrate that SARC achieves superior performance across all metrics compared to baseline models. The code is available at: https://github.com/jxshang/SARC.

<div> Keywords: language model, instruction hierarchy, reasoning task, reinforcement learning, safety-critical settings

Summary:
This article introduces the concept of instruction hierarchy in large language models (LLMs) to manage conflicting instructions from different sources within a prompt context. The researchers frame instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task and create the VerIH dataset to train models on prioritizing instructions. Through lightweight reinforcement learning, models are trained to understand the relationship between user prompts and system instructions, leading to improvements in instruction following and hierarchy benchmarks. The trained models demonstrate enhanced reasoning abilities that extend to safety-critical scenarios, protecting against adversarial attacks. By effectively resolving conflicts between user inputs and predefined policies, the models exhibit robustness and controllability in responding to prompt updates. This research highlights how reasoning over instruction hierarchies can enhance the reliability and performance of LLMs in real-world decision-making contexts.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first "think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior.

Abstract: The early detection of mental health disorders from social media text is critical for enabling timely support, risk assessment, and referral to appropriate resources. This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned RoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple curated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps, revealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well as anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category. Comparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods, domain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models demonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro F1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup (excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline classifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including Layer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues that drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression from suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned transformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts, while also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and human-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as a lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental health platforms.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources to address their limitations in accessing up-to-date or specialized information. A natural strategy to increase the likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of retrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks. Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of WinnowRAG over state-of-the-art baselines.

Summary:<br /><br />
In this study, a systematic review was conducted on 445 benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) to evaluate their capabilities and identify safety or robustness issues. It was found that the measures used in these benchmarks often did not effectively capture the phenomena of safety and robustness, leading to questionable validity of the claims made. The team of 29 expert reviewers identified patterns related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics that undermined the construct validity of the benchmarks. To address these shortcomings, eight key recommendations and actionable guidance were provided for researchers and practitioners in the development of LLM benchmarks. It is crucial for the field to improve the measurement of safety and robustness in LLM evaluations to ensure the reliability and validity of their assessments.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is crucial for both assessing their capabilities and identifying safety or robustness issues prior to deployment. Reliably measuring abstract and complex phenomena such as 'safety' and 'robustness' requires strong construct validity, that is, having measures that represent what matters to the phenomenon. With a team of 29 expert reviewers, we conduct a systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks from leading conferences in natural language processing and machine learning. Across the reviewed articles, we find patterns related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the resulting claims. To address these shortcomings, we provide eight key recommendations and detailed actionable guidance to researchers and practitioners in developing LLM benchmarks.

Summary:
POLIS-Bench is introduced as a comprehensive evaluation suite for LLMs in governmental bilingual policy scenarios. It includes an up-to-date bilingual policy corpus, scenario-grounded task design, and a dual-metric evaluation framework. The benchmark reveals a performance hierarchy among LLMs, with reasoning models excelling in cross-task stability and accuracy. Compliance tasks are particularly challenging. Leveraging POLIS-Bench, a lightweight open-source model achieves comparable or better performance to proprietary baselines at a reduced cost. This provides a cost-effective pathway for real-world governmental deployment. <div>
arXiv:2511.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce POLIS-Bench, the first rigorous, systematic evaluation suite designed for LLMs operating in governmental bilingual policy scenarios. Compared to existing benchmarks, POLIS-Bench introduces three major advancements. (i) Up-to-date Bilingual Corpus: We construct an extensive, up-to-date policy corpus that significantly scales the effective assessment sample size, ensuring relevance to current governance practice. (ii) Scenario-Grounded Task Design: We distill three specialized, scenario-grounded tasks -- Clause Retrieval & Interpretation, Solution Generation, and the Compliance Judgmen--to comprehensively probe model understanding and application. (iii) Dual-Metric Evaluation Framework: We establish a novel dual-metric evaluation framework combining semantic similarity with accuracy rate to precisely measure both content alignment and task requirement adherence. A large-scale evaluation of over 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on POLIS-Bench reveals a clear performance hierarchy where reasoning models maintain superior cross-task stability and accuracy, highlighting the difficulty of compliance tasks. Furthermore, leveraging our benchmark, we successfully fine-tune a lightweight open-source model. The resulting POLIS series models achieves parity with, or surpasses, strong proprietary baselines on multiple policy subtasks at a significantly reduced cost, providing a cost-effective and compliant path for robust real-world governmental deployment.

Summary: 
The study focuses on understanding how training samples affect Large Language Model (LLM) decision-making and the methods used to estimate their influence. Contrary to prior beliefs, the cancellation effect hypothesis regarding the informative nature of the first layers for influence computation is debunked. The research suggests that middle attention layers are more accurate estimators of influence in LLMs. Additionally, alternative aggregation methods such as ranking and vote-based approaches significantly improve influence score performance. The study introduces the Noise Detection Rate (NDR) as a novel metric for assessing influence score efficacy without retraining the model, demonstrating superior predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect. Through extensive experimentation with various types and scales of LLMs, the research concludes that the first layers are not always better than the last layers for influence estimation in LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM) decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work, we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR) that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect. Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior knowledge in the field.

RADAR, or Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, is a system designed to aid in rare disease detection in brain MRI scans. The approach utilizes AI agents that have access to external medical knowledge from case reports and literature. By embedding this knowledge and using efficient similarity search techniques, RADAR can retrieve relevant evidence to assist radiologists in making diagnostic decisions for unfamiliar diseases.

Abstract: Rare diseases represent the long tail of medical imaging, where AI models often fail due to the scarcity of representative training data. In clinical workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2% performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence conditions in medical imaging.

Summary:<br />
- The study focuses on quantifying linguistic diversity in image captioning using surprisal variance, which measures the spread of token-level negative log-probabilities within a set of captions.
- Comparison of five advanced vision-and-language LLMs, decoded with greedy and nucleus sampling, to human captions on the MSCOCO test set reveals humans display approximately double the surprisal variance of models.
- However, when rescoring captions with a general-language model, the pattern is reversed, indicating the importance of evaluating diversity under multiple scoring metrics.
- The analysis introduces the metric of surprisal-based diversity for image captioning, highlighting the need for robust evaluation methods in assessing diversity.
- It is emphasized that relying on a single scorer can completely reverse conclusions, underscoring the significance of considering surprisal under various scorers in diversity evaluations. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We quantify linguistic diversity in image captioning with surprisal variance - the spread of token-level negative log-probabilities within a caption set. On the MSCOCO test set, we compare five state-of-the-art vision-and-language LLMs, decoded with greedy and nucleus sampling, to human captions. Measured with a caption-trained n-gram LM, humans display roughly twice the surprisal variance of models, but rescoring the same captions with a general-language model reverses the pattern. Our analysis introduces the surprisal-based diversity metric for image captioning. We show that relying on a single scorer can completely invert conclusions, thus, robust diversity evaluation must report surprisal under several scorers.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Verifiable Rewards, Large Language Models, Group Relative Policy Optimization, Explore Residual Prompts<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and the challenges faced when training large language models (LLMs) with residual prompts providing no training signal. The Explore Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework is introduced to address this issue by encouraging exploration on residual prompts and reactivating their training signals. ERPO maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adjusts sampling temperature for prompts with all correct responses to introduce more diverse reasoning traces. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ERPO outperforms strong baselines, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of training large language models with RLVR. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts, those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently, fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces, introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

<div> sampling, semantic calibration, question-answering, calibration, local loss optimality 
Summary:<br /><br />Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to exhibit semantic calibration in open-domain question-answering tasks, suggesting they can assess confidence in their responses beyond token-level. A theoretical framework based on next-token prediction explains how semantic calibration emerges as a byproduct of calibration and local loss optimality. Base LLMs are expected to be semantically calibrated when able to predict their distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. Experimental validation confirms three implications: (1) Base LLMs exhibit semantic calibration, (2) RL instruction-tuning breaks this calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning disrupts calibration. This study provides a foundational understanding of the conditions under which semantic calibration arises in LLMs. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for their outputs. While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.

Summary: 
1. The study explores the emergence of behavioral self-awareness in Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit supervision.
2. Through experiments with low-rank adapters (LoRA), it is found that self-awareness can be induced with a single rank-1 LoRA adapter.
3. The learned self-aware behavior can be represented by a single steering vector in activation space, capturing most of the fine-tune's effect.
4. Self-awareness is domain-specific and localized, with unique representations across tasks.
5. The findings suggest that self-awareness in LLMs is a linear feature that can be easily induced and modulated. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that LLMs can exhibit behavioral self-awareness: the ability to accurately describe or predict their own learned behaviors without explicit supervision. This capability raises safety concerns as it may, for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily induced and modulated.

<div> benchmark, visual document retrieval, Korean, public documents, multimodal models <br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces SDS KoPub VDR, an innovative benchmark focusing on visual document retrieval for Korean public documents. The benchmark includes a corpus of 361 real-world documents with complex visual elements such as tables and charts. It also features 600 query-page-answer triples generated using multimodal models and refined for accuracy. The queries cover six major public domains and are categorized based on reasoning modality. Evaluation tasks include text-only retrieval and multimodal retrieval to assess model performance. Results show significant gaps in performance, particularly in multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning. SDS KoPub VDR not only facilitates rigorous evaluation of textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also serves as a valuable resource for advancing multimodal AI in real-world document intelligence.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.04910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for visual document retrieval (VDR) largely overlook non-English languages and the structural complexity of official publications. To address this critical gap, we introduce SDS KoPub VDR, the first large-scale, publicly available benchmark for retrieving and understanding Korean public documents. The benchmark is built upon a corpus of 361 real-world documents (40,781 pages), including 256 files under the KOGL Type 1 license and 105 from official legal portals, capturing complex visual elements like tables, charts, and multi-column layouts. To establish a challenging and reliable evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples. These were initially generated using multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) and subsequently underwent a rigorous human verification and refinement process to ensure factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The queries span six major public domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required: text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2) multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features (e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art models. As a foundational resource, SDS KoPub VDR not only enables rigorous and fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world document intelligence.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, BudgetMem, memory constraints, selective memory policies, document length

Summary:
BudgetMem is a novel memory augmented architecture designed to address the computational and memory challenges faced by Large Language Models when processing long contexts. It focuses on learning what information to remember rather than storing everything, utilizing selective memory policies and feature-based salience scoring. The system combines learned gating mechanisms with BM25 sparse retrieval to efficiently access information while under strict budget constraints. Through comprehensive experiments, BudgetMem demonstrates remarkable results on long documents, achieving minimal F1 score degradation while saving a significant amount of memory compared to baseline models. The approach is validated through budget sensitivity analysis, baseline comparisons, and document length analysis, highlighting its benefits increasing with longer documents. BudgetMem offers a practical solution for deploying advanced language understanding capabilities on modest hardware, making it more accessible to a wider range of users.

arXiv:2511.04919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory constraints when processing long contexts, despite growing demand for applications requiring reasoning over extensive documents, multi-session dialogues, and book length texts. While recent advances have extended context windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything. Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks, BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700 question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens) documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits increase with document length. Our work provides a practical pathway for deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access to advanced language understanding capabilities.

Summary:
Large language model agents are being used for tasks like information retrieval and complex reasoning on the web. To facilitate scientific research, automation of experiment design through dataset and baseline retrieval is critical in AI research. Existing methods have limitations in data coverage and bias toward superficial similarity. In this study, a framework for comprehensive baseline and dataset recommendation is proposed by leveraging collective perception from citation networks. An automated data-collection pipeline links accepted papers to the baselines and datasets they actually used. A collective perception enhanced retriever is designed to represent the scholarly network, enabling efficient candidate recall. A reasoning-augmented reranker constructs explicit reasoning chains for interpretable justifications and refined rankings. The method outperforms prior baselines with significant improvements in Recall@20 and HitRate@5 on datasets from top AI conferences. This advancement offers reliable and interpretable automation for experimental design.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language model agents are becoming increasingly capable at web-centric tasks such as information retrieval, complex reasoning. These emerging capabilities have given rise to surge research interests in developing LLM agent for facilitating scientific quest. One key application in AI research is to automate experiment design through agentic dataset and baseline retrieval. However, prior efforts suffer from limited data coverage, as recommendation datasets primarily harvest candidates from public portals and omit many datasets actually used in published papers, and from an overreliance on content similarity that biases model toward superficial similarity and overlooks experimental suitability. Harnessing collective perception embedded in the baseline and dataset citation network, we present a comprehensive framework for baseline and dataset recommendation. First, we design an automated data-collection pipeline that links roughly one hundred thousand accepted papers to the baselines and datasets they actually used. Second, we propose a collective perception enhanced retriever. To represent the position of each dataset or baseline within the scholarly network, it concatenates self-descriptions with aggregated citation contexts. To achieve efficient candidate recall, we finetune an embedding model on these representations. Finally, we develop a reasoning-augmented reranker that exact interaction chains to construct explicit reasoning chains and finetunes a large language model to produce interpretable justifications and refined rankings. The dataset we curated covers 85\% of the datasets and baselines used at top AI conferences over the past five years. On our dataset, the proposed method outperforms the strongest prior baseline with average gains of +5.85\% in Recall@20, +8.30\% in HitRate@5. Taken together, our results advance reliable, interpretable automation of experimental design.

Abstract: Wikidata is currently the largest open knowledge graph on the web, encompassing over 120 million entities. It integrates data from various domain-specific databases and imports a substantial amount of content from Wikipedia, while also allowing users to freely edit its content. This openness has positioned Wikidata as a central resource in knowledge graph research and has enabled convenient knowledge access for users worldwide. However, its relatively loose editorial policy has also led to a degree of taxonomic inconsistency. Building on prior work, this study proposes and applies a novel validation method to confirm the presence of classification errors, over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific domains of Wikidata. We further introduce a new evaluation criterion for determining whether such issues warrant correction and develop a system that allows users to inspect the taxonomic relationships of arbitrary Wikidata entities-leveraging the platform's crowdsourced nature to its full potential.

Summary: <br />
Long context inference in large language models is important but computationally intensive. Existing methods for parallel tokenization suffer from inconsistent results. To address this issue, a novel framework called LoPT is proposed, ensuring lossless tokenization with significant speedup. LoPT uses character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment to accurately align and merge tokenized segments. Extensive experiments on various long-text datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and consistency of LoPT. The theoretical proof and analytical studies further validate the robustness of the approach. <div>

Abstract: Long context inference scenarios have become increasingly important for large language models, yet they introduce significant computational latency. While prior research has optimized long-sequence inference through operators, model architectures, and system frameworks, tokenization remains an overlooked bottleneck. Existing parallel tokenization methods accelerate processing through text segmentation and multi-process tokenization, but they suffer from inconsistent results due to boundary artifacts that occur after merging. To address this, we propose LoPT, a novel Lossless Parallel Tokenization framework that ensures output identical to standard sequential tokenization. Our approach employs character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment to align and merge tokenized segments accurately. Extensive experiments across diverse long-text datasets demonstrate that LoPT achieves significant speedup while guaranteeing lossless tokenization. We also provide theoretical proof of consistency and comprehensive analytical studies to validate the robustness of our method.

<br />
Summary: The study explores the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to portray morally ambiguous or villainous characters. The researchers introduce the Moral RolePlay benchmark, which evaluates LLMs' role-playing fidelity on a four-level moral alignment scale. Results show a decline in role-playing accuracy as character morality decreases, with models struggling with traits like deceit and manipulation. The study highlights a conflict between model safety and creative fidelity, as highly safety-aligned models perform poorly in playing villainous roles. The findings emphasize the need for more nuanced alignment methods to address this limitation. <div>
arXiv:2511.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful'' and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

Abstract: Knowledge about emotional events is an important kind of knowledge which has been applied to improve the effectiveness of different applications. However, emotional events cannot be easily acquired, especially common or generalized emotional events that are context-independent. The goal of this paper is to obtain common emotional events in Chinese language such as "win a prize" and "be criticized". Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of Chinese emotional event indicators. Then, we generate emotional events by prompting a Chinese large language model (LLM) using these indicators. To ensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard invalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being positive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we harvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment polarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of emotional events in Chinese language. Intrinsic evaluation results show that the proposed method in this paper can be effectively used to acquire common Chinese emotional events. An extrinsic use case also demonstrates the strong potential of common emotional events in the field of emotion cause extraction (ECE). Related resources including emotional event indicators and emotional events will be released after the publication of this paper.

Summary:
PBSUITE is introduced as a dynamic evaluation suite for assessing LLMs' adherence to pluralistic alignment in multi-turn conversations. It includes a dataset with 300 behavioral policies from various industries and an evaluation framework to test model compliance in adversarial conditions. Leading LLMs show strong adherence to behavioral policies in single-turn interactions but struggle in multi-turn adversarial settings, indicating a gap in enforcing pluralistic behavioral policies. The study highlights the need for improved alignment and safety measures to support diverse user values in real-world LLM interactions. <div>
arXiv:2511.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to a universal set of safety and usage principles intended for broad public acceptability. Yet, real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements, use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE (PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs' capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn, interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300 realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to 84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.

Abstract: Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves the way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models.

Summary: 
This paper investigates the commonalities in context aggregation patterns across different language models (LMs). By analyzing the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from Attention Rollout, the study reveals significant similarities in OLA among different LMs at the same order, suggesting a implicit mapping to syntactic knowledge. Based on these findings, the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA) is proposed as a training-free method for cross-LM knowledge transfer. By utilizing OLA as a syntactic feature representation, TOA generalizes effectively to unseen LMs without parameter updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the TOA method enhances the performance of unseen LMs through cross-LM generalization. The code implementation of the proposed method is available on GitHub for further exploration and application.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet previously neglected question: Do context aggregation patterns across Language Models (LMs) share commonalities? While some works have investigated context aggregation or attention weights in LMs, they typically focus on individual models or attention heads, lacking a systematic analysis across multiple LMs to explore their commonalities. In contrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our understanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In this work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we discover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on these two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a training-free cross-LM adapter transfer method. Specifically, we treat the OLA as a unified syntactic feature representation and train an adapter that takes OLA as input. Due to the similarities in OLA across LMs, the adapter generalizes to unseen LMs without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TOA's cross-LM generalization effectively enhances the performance of unseen LMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jinglin-liang/OLAS.

Abstract: We address claim normalization for multilingual misinformation detection - transforming noisy social media posts into clear, verifiable statements across 20 languages. The key contribution demonstrates how systematic decomposition of posts using Who, What, Where, When, Why and How questions enables robust cross-lingual transfer despite training exclusively on English data. Our methodology incorporates finetuning Qwen3-14B using LoRA with the provided dataset after intra-post deduplication, token-level recall filtering for semantic alignment and retrieval-augmented few-shot learning with contextual examples during inference. Our system achieves METEOR scores ranging from 41.16 (English) to 15.21 (Marathi), securing third rank on the English leaderboard and fourth rank for Dutch and Punjabi. The approach shows 41.3% relative improvement in METEOR over baseline configurations and substantial gains over existing methods. Results demonstrate effective cross-lingual generalization for Romance and Germanic languages while maintaining semantic coherence across diverse linguistic structures.

<div> health-seeking behavior, digital consumption, text simplification, linguistic capabilities, discourse fidelity 
Summary:<br /><br />The study evaluates the performance of two large language models (LLMs) for text simplification. Mistral 24B shows a balanced approach to simplification, improving readability and maintaining discourse fidelity with a high BERTScore of 0.91. In contrast, QWen2.5 32B struggles to balance readability and accuracy, resulting in a lower BERTScore of 0.89. Mistral's lexical simplification strategy enhances readability metrics and achieves a mean SARI of 42.46. The study also identifies the importance of heuristic metric selection for text simplification tasks. Further analysis reveals functional redundancies among readability indices and highlights lexical support as a crucial domain-adaptation issue for text simplification models. This empirical evidence establishes Mistral as a promising option for text simplification and provides valuable insights for improving the effectiveness of LLMs in this domain.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The increasing health-seeking behavior and digital consumption of biomedical information by the general public necessitate scalable solutions for automatically adapting complex scientific and technical documents into plain language. Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large language models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral 24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46), while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability, discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary domain-adaptation issue for simplification.

Summary: 
This work explores distillation methods for large language models (LLMs) to create compact models without significant performance loss. By iteratively evaluating layer importance and training with a joint loss function, the proposed method based on ShortGPT reduces the number of layers in the Qwen2.5-3B model with minimal quality loss. Experiment results show that middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, indicating the potential of the approach for efficient model creation. The findings highlight the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making the method suitable for resource-limited environments. <div>

Abstract: This work investigates distillation methods for large language models (LLMs) with the goal of developing compact models that preserve high performance. Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a 9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making the approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt optimization has demonstrated effectiveness in refining prompts for LLMs. However, existing approaches lack robust operators and efficient evaluation mechanisms. In this work, we propose several key improvements to evolutionary prompt optimization that can partially generalize to prompt optimization in general: 1) decomposing evolution into distinct steps to enhance the evolution and its control, 2) introducing an LLM-based judge to verify the evolutions, 3) integrating human feedback to refine the evolutionary operator, and 4) developing more efficient evaluation strategies that maintain performance while reducing computational overhead. Our approach improves both optimization quality and efficiency. We release our code, enabling prompt optimization on new tasks and facilitating further research in this area.

Summary: <br /><br />ManufactuBERT is a specialized RoBERTa model pretrained on a large-scale corpus specifically curated for the manufacturing domain. The development of ManufactuBERT involved creating a comprehensive data processing pipeline to filter domain-specific terminology and semantics from web data. The multi-stage deduplication process implemented in the pipeline significantly reduced redundancies, leading to improved model performance. ManufactuBERT outperformed strong specialized baselines on manufacturing-related NLP tasks, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in the field. Additionally, training on the carefully deduplicated corpus accelerated convergence, reducing training time and computational costs by 33%. The proposed pipeline serves as a reproducible example for building high-performing encoders in other specialized domains.

Abstract: While large general-purpose Transformer-based encoders excel at general language understanding, their performance diminishes in specialized domains like manufacturing due to a lack of exposure to domain-specific terminology and semantics. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing ManufactuBERT, a RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale corpus curated for the manufacturing domain. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline to create this corpus from web data, involving an initial domain-specific filtering step followed by a multi-stage deduplication process that removes redundancies. Our experiments show that ManufactuBERT establishes a new state-of-the-art on a range of manufacturing-related NLP tasks, outperforming strong specialized baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that training on our carefully deduplicated corpus significantly accelerates convergence, leading to a 33\% reduction in training time and computational cost compared to training on the non-deduplicated dataset. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible example for developing high-performing encoders in other specialized domains. We will release our model and curated corpus at https://huggingface.co/cea-list-ia.

arXiv:2511.05162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most current large language models (LLMs) support a wide variety of languages in addition to English, including high-resource languages (e.g. German, Chinese, French), as well as low-resource ones (e.g. Swahili, Telugu). In addition they have also shown impressive capabilities in different domains, like coding, science and math. In this short paper, taking math as an example domain, we study the performance of different LLMs across languages. Experimental results show that there exists a non-negligible and consistent gap in the performance of the models across languages. Interestingly, and somewhat against expectations, the gap exists for both high- and low-resource languages. We hope that these results influence further research into cross-lingual capability generalization for next generation LLMs. If it weren't for the fact that they are false! By analyzing one of the standard multilingual math benchmarks (MGSM), we determine that several translation errors are present in the data. Furthermore, the lack of standardized answer extraction from LLM outputs further influences the final results. We propose a method for automatic quality assurance to address the first issue at scale, and give recommendations to address the second one. Combining these two approaches we show that the aforementioned language gap mostly disappears, leading to completely different conclusions from our research. We additionally release the corrected dataset to the community.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a widely used method to improve the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). More recently, CoT has been leveraged in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer reasoning capability from a larger LLM to a smaller one. This paper examines the role of CoT in distilling the reasoning capability from larger LLMs to smaller LLMs using white-box KD, analysing its effectiveness in improving the performance of the distilled models for various natural language reasoning and understanding tasks. We conduct white-box KD experiments using LLMs from the Qwen and Llama2 families, employing CoT data from the CoT-Collection dataset. The distilled models are then evaluated on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from the BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH) benchmark, which presents complex challenges for smaller LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the role of CoT in improving white-box KD effectiveness, enabling the distilled models to achieve better average performance in natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from BBH.

In this study, the process of translating classical Chinese into Japanese through character annotation is analyzed as sequence tagging tasks compatible with modern language technologies. The research addresses the challenge of low-resource availability in this annotation and translation system by introducing a LLM-based annotation pipeline and developing a new dataset from digitalized open-source translation data. The study demonstrates that incorporating auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks enhances the training of sequence tagging tasks in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Ancient people translated classical Chinese into Japanese by annotating around each character. We abstract this process as sequence tagging tasks and fit them into modern language technologies. The research of this annotation and translation system is a facing low-resource problem. We release this problem by introducing a LLM-based annotation pipeline and construct a new dataset from digitalized open-source translation data. We show that under the low-resource setting, introducing auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks has a promoting effect on the training of sequence tagging tasks. We also evaluate the performance of large language models. They achieve high scores in direct machine translation, but they are confused when being asked to annotate characters. Our method could work as a supplement of LLMs.

<div> reflection module, personalization, large language models, optimization, user-centric generation<br />
<br />
Summary:
The article introduces Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a new framework for personalizing black-box large language models (LLMs). RPO decouples content generation from alignment in two stages: a base model generates a generic response, and an external reflection module rewrites it to align with user preferences. The reflection module is trained through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Experiments on the LaMP benchmark show that RPO outperforms current methods, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. RPO provides an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can enhance user-centric generation scenarios by integrating seamlessly with base models. <div>
arXiv:2511.05286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The personalization of black-box large language models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging task. Existing approaches predominantly rely on context injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs. Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.

Summary: <br />
Podcasts play a crucial role in shaping public opinion, making them a valuable resource for studying contemporary discourse. However, their unscripted and conversational nature poses challenges for automated analysis. Current language models struggle to accurately capture the narrative frames used in podcasts, hindering large-scale analysis. To address this, a fine-tuned BERT model is developed to link narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in conversations. This methodology bridges the gap between abstract frames and concrete details, enabling a more nuanced analysis of podcast narratives. By correlating granular frame labels with high-level topics, broader discourse trends can be revealed. The study highlights a novel frame-labeling approach that aligns better with human judgment for messy data and uncovers the relationship between discussed topics and presentation frames, providing a robust framework for studying influence in digital media. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models, typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.

Summary: 
Court decisions in continental European countries provide detailed descriptions of criminal behaviors in verdicts. This study from Slovakia explores the use of regular expressions and large language models (LLMs) to extract these descriptions. While a baseline method using regular expressions identified descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, advanced regular expressions and LLMs significantly improved performance, reaching 97% and 98.75%, respectively. When combined, the methods achieved a detection rate of 99.5%. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5% for the baseline. LLMs were particularly effective, fully matching human-labeled descriptions in 91.75% of instances. The combination of advanced regular expressions with LLMs reached a matching rate of 92%. <div>

Abstract: Criminal justice administrative data contain only a limited amount of information about the committed offense. However, there is an unused source of extensive information in continental European courts' decisions: descriptions of criminal behaviors in verdicts by which offenders are found guilty. In this paper, we study the feasibility of extracting these descriptions from publicly available court decisions from Slovakia. We use two different approaches for retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description. The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and 99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5% for the baseline. LLMs fully matched human-labeled descriptions in 91.75% of instances, and a combination of advanced regular expressions with LLMs reached 92%.

Summary:
BengaliBPE, a BPE tokenizer designed for Bengali script, addresses limitations of current tokenizers by applying Unicode normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules. Evaluation on a Bengali news classification dataset shows BengaliBPE provides detailed segmentation and better morphological interpretability compared to baselines like Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE, despite slightly higher computational cost. This highlights the importance of language-aware tokenization for morphologically rich scripts and establishes BengaliBPE as a strong foundation for future Bengali NLP systems, including large-scale pretraining of contextual language models.

arXiv:2511.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenization is an important first step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines because it decides how models learn and represent linguistic information. However, current subword tokenizers like SentencePiece or HuggingFace BPE are mostly designed for Latin or multilingual corpora and do not perform well on languages with rich morphology such as Bengali. To address this limitation, we present BengaliBPE, a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer specifically developed for the Bengali script. BengaliBPE applies Unicode normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules to maintain linguistic consistency and preserve subword integrity. We use a large-scale Bengali news classification dataset to compare BengaliBPE with three baselines: Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE. The evaluation considers tokenization granularity, encoding speed, and downstream classification accuracy. While all methods perform reasonably well, BengaliBPE provides the most detailed segmentation and the best morphological interpretability, albeit with slightly higher computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of language-aware tokenization for morphologically rich scripts and establish BengaliBPE as a strong foundation for future Bengali NLP systems, including large-scale pretraining of contextual language models.

Summary:
This research proposal focuses on understanding the architecture of the bilingual word recognition system and how multilinguals may outperform monolinguals in various linguistic and cognitive tasks. The study builds on previous work on multiplex models of the mental lexicon and the Bilingual Interactive Activation framework. It introduces multimodality by incorporating visual inputs into a translation task to explore how visual input affects participants' proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions. The research aims to investigate how a heritage language influences the acquisition of another language. <div>

Abstract: Historically, bilingualism was often perceived as an additional cognitive load that could hinder linguistic and intellectual development. However, over the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants' proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?

Abstract: As cyber threats continue to grow in complexity, traditional security mechanisms struggle to keep up. Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential in cybersecurity due to their advanced capabilities in text processing and generation. This paper explores the use of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to obtain threat intelligence by combining real-time information retrieval with domain-specific data. The proposed system, RAGRecon, uses a LLM with RAG to answer questions about cybersecurity threats. Moreover, it makes this form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) explainable by generating and visually presenting to the user a knowledge graph for every reply. This increases the transparency and interpretability of the reasoning of the model, allowing analysts to better understand the connections made by the system based on the context recovered by the RAG system. We evaluated RAGRecon experimentally with two datasets and seven different LLMs and the responses matched the reference responses more than 91% of the time for the best combinations.

Abstract: User satisfaction in dialogue systems is inherently subjective. When the same response strategy is applied across users, minority users may assign different satisfaction ratings than majority users due to variations in individual intents and preferences. However, existing alignment methods typically train one-size-fits-all models that aim for broad consensus, often overlooking minority perspectives and user-specific adaptation. We propose a unified framework that models both individual- and group-level preferences for user satisfaction estimation. First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning (CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning chains. Second, we propose an expectation-maximization-based Majority-Minority Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) algorithm that discovers distinct user groups in an unsupervised manner to learn group-level preferences. Finally, we integrate these components into a preference-adaptive reinforcement learning framework (PAda-PPO) that jointly optimizes alignment with both individual and group preferences. Experiments on the Emotional Support Conversation dataset demonstrate consistent improvements in user satisfaction estimation, particularly for underrepresented user groups.

<div> steering, language models, feedback, weight arithmetic, behavioral control 
Summary:
Contrastive weight steering is introduced as a post-training method for Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve feedback quality and generalization on diverse training distributions. By manipulating model weights through weight arithmetic, behavior direction in weight-space is isolated, mitigating sycophancy and inducing misalignment. Weight steering surpasses activation steering in out-of-distribution behavioral control while maintaining general capabilities. It effectively mitigates sycophancy and under-refusals post task-specific fine-tuning without compromising task performance gains. The method also shows promise in detecting emergent misalignment by monitoring weight evolution during training. This technique suggests a potential for early detection of rare misaligned behaviors not observed during regular training or evaluations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing high-quality feedback to Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse training distribution can be difficult and expensive, and providing feedback only on a narrow distribution can result in unintended generalizations. To better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this direction to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities. We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an "evil" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that never manifest during training or evaluations.

<div> Keywords: Disease diagnosis, healthcare, electronic health record, diagnostic dataset, likelihood-based re-ranking

Summary:
Disease diagnosis plays a crucial role in healthcare, allowing for early detection and appropriate intervention. The MIMIC-SR-ICD11 dataset has been introduced, which aligns English diagnostic data from electronic health record discharge notes with WHO ICD-11 terminology. A new framework called LL-Rank has been developed, which uses a likelihood-based re-ranking approach to improve diagnostic accuracy. LL-Rank outperforms a baseline method across different model backbones, with its primary advantage attributed to PMI-based scoring that focuses on semantic compatibility and reduces label frequency bias. This innovative approach enhances the preservation of clinically important signals that may be overlooked in traditional templated EHR documentation, ultimately improving the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis in the healthcare setting. 

<br /><br />Summary: Disease diagnosis is essential for early detection and intervention in healthcare. The MIMIC-SR-ICD11 dataset aligns diagnostic data with WHO ICD-11 terminology, while LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework, boosts diagnostic accuracy by focusing on semantic compatibility and reducing label frequency bias. This innovative approach enhances the retention of crucial clinical signals often omitted in electronic health records, improving disease diagnosis efficiency and accuracy in healthcare settings. <div>
arXiv:2511.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disease diagnosis is a central pillar of modern healthcare, enabling early detection and timely intervention for acute conditions while guiding lifestyle adjustments and medication regimens to prevent or slow chronic disease. Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The Key-Value (KV) cache is crucial for efficient autoregressive inference in large language models (LLMs), but in stateful multi-turn scenarios, its uncontrolled growth poses challenges. The study examines the relationship between KV cache management strategies, model architecture limits, and the integrity of positional encodings. It finds that LLM generation quality declines when the accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window, distinct from GPU memory issues. Eviction strategies, even high-retention ones, can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Preserving contiguous context blocks through simple strategies can result in more coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. The study advocates for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, retain positional structure, and consider overall "cache health" rather than just size. <div>

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window (e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.

Abstract: Geotechnical reports are crucial for assessing the stability of rock formations and ensuring safety in modern engineering. Traditionally, these reports are prepared manually based on field observations using compasses, magnifying glasses, and notebooks. This method is slow, prone to errors, and subjective in its interpretations. To overcome these limitations, the use of artificial intelligence techniques is proposed for the automatic generation of reports through the processing of images and field data. The methodology was based on the collection of photographs of rock outcrops and manual samples with their respective descriptions, as well as on the reports prepared during the Geotechnical Studies course. These resources were used to define the report outline, prompt engineering, and validate the responses of a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The iterative refinement of prompts until structured and specific instructions were obtained for each section of the report proved to be an effective alternative to the costly process of fine-tuning the MLLM. The system evaluation establishes values of 0.455 and 0.653 for the BLEU and ROUGE-L metrics, respectively, suggesting that automatic descriptions are comparable to those made by experts. This tool, accessible via the web, with an intuitive interface and the ability to export to standardized formats, represents an innovation and an important contribution for professionals and students of field geology.

Abstract: We explore whether neural networks can decode brain activity into speech by mapping EEG recordings to audio representations. Using EEG data recorded as subjects listened to natural speech, we train a model with a contrastive CLIP loss to align EEG-derived embeddings with embeddings from a pre-trained transformer-based speech model. Building on the state-of-the-art EEG decoder from Meta, we introduce three architectural modifications: (i) subject-specific attention layers (+0.15% WER improvement), (ii) personalized spatial attention (+0.45%), and (iii) a dual-path RNN with attention (-1.87%). Two of the three modifications improved performance, highlighting the promise of personalized architectures for brain-to-speech decoding and applications in brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: Disinformation campaigns can distort public perception and destabilize institutions. Understanding how different populations respond to information is crucial for designing effective interventions, yet real-world experimentation is impractical and ethically challenging. To address this, we develop an agent-based simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs) to model responses to misinformation. We construct agent personas spanning five professions and three mental schemas, and evaluate their reactions to news headlines. Our findings show that LLM-generated agents align closely with ground-truth labels and human predictions, supporting their use as proxies for studying information responses. We also find that mental schemas, more than professional background, influence how agents interpret misinformation. This work provides a validation of LLMs to be used as agents in an agent-based model of an information network for analyzing trust, polarization, and susceptibility to deceptive content in complex social systems.

Summary: 
NINJA is a new method for attacking long-context language models by appending harmless content to harmful user goals, demonstrating the importance of goal positioning in safety. The experiments on the HarmBench benchmark show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates on various state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemini. This method is low-resource, transferrable, and less detectable compared to previous jailbreaking techniques. NINJA is also shown to be compute-optimal, as increasing context length under a fixed compute budget can outperform increasing the number of trials in traditional jailbreak methods. These results highlight that benign long contexts, when strategically crafted, can introduce significant vulnerabilities in modern long-context language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in long-context language models (LMs) have enabled million-token inputs, expanding their capabilities across complex tasks like computer-use agents. Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by appending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench, show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource, transferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is compute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can outperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These findings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful goal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) represents a rapidly expanding digital infrastructure whose energy demand and associated CO2 emissions are emerging as a new category of climate risk. This study introduces G-TRACE (GenAI Transformative Carbon Estimator), a cross-modal, region-aware framework that quantifies training- and inference-related emissions across modalities and deployment geographies. Using real-world analytics and microscopic simulation, G-TRACE measures energy use and carbon intensity per output type (text, image, video) and reveals how decentralized inference amplifies small per-query energy costs into system-level impacts. Through the Ghibli-style image generation trend (2024-2025), we estimate 4,309 MWh of energy consumption and 2,068 tCO2 emissions, illustrating how viral participation inflates individual digital actions into tonne-scale consequences. Building on these findings, we propose the AI Sustainability Pyramid, a seven-level governance model linking carbon accounting metrics (L1-L7) with operational readiness, optimization, and stewardship. This framework translates quantitative emission metrics into actionable policy guidance for sustainable AI deployment. The study contributes to the quantitative assessment of emerging digital infrastructures as a novel category of climate risk, supporting adaptive governance for sustainable technology deployment. By situating GenAI within climate-risk frameworks, the work advances data-driven methods for aligning technological innovation with global decarbonization and resilience objectives.

Abstract: Prior to recent successes using neural networks, term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) was clearly regarded as the best choice for identifying documents related to a query. We provide a different score, aver, and observe, on a dataset with ground truth marking for association, that aver does do better at finding assciated pairs than tf-idf. This example involves finding associated vertices in a large graph and that may be an area where neural networks are not currently an obvious best choice. Beyond this one anecdote, we observe that (1) aver has a natural threshold for declaring pairs as unassociated while tf-idf does not, (2) aver can distinguish between pairs of documents for which tf-idf gives a score of 1.0, (3) aver can be applied to larger collections of documents than pairs while tf-idf cannot, and (4) that aver is derived from entropy under a simple statistical model while tf-idf is a construction designed to achieve a certain goal and hence aver may be more "natural." To be fair, we also observe that (1) writing down and computing the aver score for a pair is more complex than for tf-idf and (2) that the fact that the aver score is naturally scale-free makes it more complicated to interpret aver scores.

Abstract: High-Risk Property (HRP) classification is critical at U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sites, where inventories include sensitive and often dual-use equipment. Compliance must track evolving rules designated by various export control policies to make transparent and auditable decisions. Traditional expert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep pace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles (run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The demonstration shows single item submission, grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and exportable audit artifacts, illustrating a practical path to trustworthy LLM assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows.

Abstract: This research-to-practice full paper was inspired by the persistent challenge in effective communication among engineering students. Public speaking is a necessary skill for future engineers as they have to communicate technical knowledge with diverse stakeholders. While universities offer courses or workshops, they are unable to offer sustained and personalized training to students. Providing comprehensive feedback on both verbal and non-verbal aspects of public speaking is time-intensive, making consistent and individualized assessment impractical. This study integrates research on verbal and non-verbal cues in public speaking to develop an AI-driven assessment model for engineering students. Our approach combines speech analysis, computer vision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides assessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch, loudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial expressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel integration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike previous systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple modalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing demonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert evaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro emerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human annotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public speaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align their speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and professional communication.

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel series of Russian information retrieval datasets constructed from the "Did you know..." section of Russian Wikipedia. Our datasets support a range of retrieval tasks, including fact-checking, retrieval-augmented generation, and full-document retrieval, by leveraging interesting facts and their referenced Wikipedia articles annotated at the sentence level with graded relevance. We describe the methodology for dataset creation that enables the expansion of existing Russian Information Retrieval (IR) resources. Through extensive experiments, we extend the RusBEIR research by comparing lexical retrieval models, such as BM25, with state-of-the-art neural architectures fine-tuned for Russian, as well as multilingual models. Results of our experiments show that lexical methods tend to outperform neural models on full-document retrieval, while neural approaches better capture lexical semantics in shorter texts, such as in fact-checking or fine-grained retrieval. Using our newly created datasets, we also analyze the impact of document length on retrieval performance and demonstrate that combining retrieval with neural reranking consistently improves results. Our contribution expands the resources available for Russian information retrieval research and highlights the importance of accurate evaluation of retrieval models to achieve optimal performance. All datasets are publicly available at HuggingFace. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we also release the full implementation on GitHub.

We study the framework of \emph{language generation in the limit}, where an adversary enumerates strings from an unknown language $K$ drawn from a countable class, and an algorithm must generate unseen strings from $K$. Prior work showed that generation is always possible, and that some algorithms achieve positive lower density, revealing a \emph{validity--breadth} trade-off between correctness and coverage. We resolve a main open question in this line, proving a tight bound of $1/2$ on the best achievable lower density. We then strengthen the model to allow \emph{partial enumeration}, where the adversary reveals only an infinite subset $C \subseteq K$. We show that generation in the limit remains achievable, and if $C$ has lower density $\alpha$ in $K$, the algorithm's output achieves density at least $\alpha/2$, matching the upper bound. This generalizes the $1/2$ bound to the partial-information setting, where the generator must recover within a factor $1/2$ of the revealed subset's density. We further revisit the classical Gold--Angluin model of \emph{language identification} under partial enumeration. We characterize when identification in the limit is possible -- when hypotheses $M_t$ eventually satisfy $C \subseteq M \subseteq K$ -- and in the process give a new topological formulation of Angluin's characterization, showing that her condition is precisely equivalent to an appropriate topological space having the $T_D$ separation property.

Abstract: Generative Retrieval (GR) differs from the traditional index-then-retrieve pipeline by storing relevance in model parameters and directly generating document identifiers. However, GR often struggles to generalize and is costly to scale. We introduce QUESTER (QUEry SpecificaTion gEnerative Retrieval), which reframes GR as query specification generation - in this work, a simple keyword query handled by BM25 - using a (small) LLM. The policy is trained using reinforcement learning techniques (GRPO). Across in- and out-of-domain evaluations, we show that our model is more effective than BM25, and competitive with neural IR models, while maintaining a good efficiency

Abstract: As language models evolve into autonomous agents that act and communicate on behalf of users, ensuring safety in multi-agent ecosystems becomes a central challenge. Interactions between personal assistants and external service providers expose a core tension between utility and protection: effective collaboration requires information sharing, yet every exchange creates new attack surfaces. We introduce ConVerse, a dynamic benchmark for evaluating privacy and security risks in agent-agent interactions. ConVerse spans three practical domains (travel, real estate, insurance) with 12 user personas and over 864 contextually grounded attacks (611 privacy, 253 security). Unlike prior single-agent settings, it models autonomous, multi-turn agent-to-agent conversations where malicious requests are embedded within plausible discourse. Privacy is tested through a three-tier taxonomy assessing abstraction quality, while security attacks target tool use and preference manipulation. Evaluating seven state-of-the-art models reveals persistent vulnerabilities; privacy attacks succeed in up to 88% of cases and security breaches in up to 60%, with stronger models leaking more. By unifying privacy and security within interactive multi-agent contexts, ConVerse reframes safety as an emergent property of communication.

Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%. Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads, leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar performance to previously established Path Patching circuits

Abstract: Polysemy and synonymy are two crucial interrelated facets of lexical ambiguity. While both phenomena are widely documented in lexical resources and have been studied extensively in NLP, leading to dedicated systems, they are often being considered independently in practical problems. While many tasks dealing with polysemy (e.g. Word Sense Disambiguation or Induction) highlight the role of word's senses, the study of synonymy is rooted in the study of concepts, i.e. meanings shared across the lexicon. In this paper, we introduce Concept Induction, the unsupervised task of learning a soft clustering among words that defines a set of concepts directly from data. This task generalizes Word Sense Induction. We propose a bi-level approach to Concept Induction that leverages both a local lemma-centric view and a global cross-lexicon view to induce concepts. We evaluate the obtained clustering on SemCor's annotated data and obtain good performance (BCubed F1 above 0.60). We find that the local and the global levels are mutually beneficial to induce concepts and also senses in our setting. Finally, we create static embeddings representing our induced concepts and use them on the Word-in-Context task, obtaining competitive performance with the State-of-the-Art.

Abstract: The rising prevalence of eye diseases poses a growing public health burden. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to reduce documentation workload and support clinical decision-making. However, few have been tailored for ophthalmology, and most evaluations focus mainly on knowledge-based QA without clinically relevant benchmarks or real-world validation. Here, we present LEME, a suite of open-weight LLMs developed through a two-stage process: (1) instruction tuning on 200,000 samples from clinical guidelines, textbooks, and case reports to enhance reasoning and task-following, and (2) reinforcement learning with ~30,000 preference labels to enhance accuracy and informativeness. LEME was evaluated on five curated zero-shot benchmarks spanning tasks such as patient QA, consultation, and treatment planning. It outperformed all seven baselines (all p < 0.004), exceeding GPT-4o by 3.32% (absolute ROUGE-L gain). It was further evaluated on three downstream tasks using deidentified patient data, reviewed by clinicians. In patient QA, LEME received the highest ratings from attending clinicians in 3 out of 4 criteria, with scores of 4.67 for factuality, 4.77 for specificity, 4.79 for completeness, and 4.88 for safety (1-5 scale). Its completeness score surpassed that of expert-written answers (4.79 vs. 4.56; p = 0.015). In visual acuity extraction, LEME achieved the highest F1, outperforming LLaMA-3 by 14.1% and Eye-LLaMA by 59.0%. In a pilot evaluation on assessment and treatment planning for diabetic retinopathy, AMD, and glaucoma, LEME received scores of 4.36 for factuality, 4.55 for specificity, 4.42 for completeness, and 4.36 for safety, approaching attending-level performance. All models, data, and code will be released to support further development and clinical translation, laying the groundwork for improved efficiency and patient care

Abstract: Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of political reality. As the significance of narratives for understanding current societal issues such as polarization and misinformation becomes increasingly evident, there is a growing demand for methods that support their empirical analysis. To this end, we propose a graph-based formalism and machine-guided method for extracting, representing, and analyzing selected narrative signals from digital textual corpora, based on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). The formalism and method introduced here specifically cater to the study of political narratives that figure in texts from digital media such as archived political speeches, social media posts, transcripts of parliamentary debates, and political manifestos on party websites. We approach the study of such political narratives as a problem of information retrieval: starting from a textual corpus, we first extract a graph-like representation of the meaning of each sentence in the corpus using AMR. Drawing on transferable concepts from narratology, we then apply a set of heuristics to filter these graphs for representations of 1) actors and their relationships, 2) the events in which these actors figure, and 3) traces of the perspectivization of these events. We approach these references to actors, events, and instances of perspectivization as core narrative signals that allude to larger political narratives. By systematically analyzing and re-assembling these signals into networks that guide the researcher to the relevant parts of the text, the underlying narratives can be reconstructed through a combination of distant and close reading. A case study of State of the European Union addresses (2010 -- 2023) demonstrates how the formalism can be used to inductively surface signals of political narratives from public discourse.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising approach to enhance their capabilities, especially for complex tasks. Synthesizing tool-use data through real-world simulations is an effective way to achieve this. However, our investigation reveals that training gains significantly decay as synthetic data increases. The model struggles to benefit from additional synthetic data, which fails to endow it with advanced tool-use capabilities in complex scenarios Moreover, we discovered that the above limitation usually manifests as a fragment deficiency (i.e., parameter errors) in response. To this end, we propose an iterative reinforced fine-tuning strategy designed to alleviate this limitation. This strategy involves: (1) enhancing the diversity of response for synthetic data through path exploration of Monte Carlo Tree Search. (2) iteratively pinpointing the model's deficiency by constructing fine-grained preference pairs, and then improving it by preference optimization algorithms for targeted improvement. The experiments show that our method achieves 13.11% better performance than the same-size base model. It achieves an improvement of 6.5% in complex scenarios compared to the baseline, and it also outperforms larger open-source and closed-source models.

Abstract: Model merging, a method that combines the parameters and embeddings of multiple fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), offers a promising approach to enhance model performance across various tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper introduces Activation-Informed Merging (AIM), a technique that integrates the information from the activation space of LLMs into the merging process to improve performance and robustness. AIM is designed as a flexible, complementary solution that is applicable to any existing merging method. It aims to preserve critical weights from the base model, drawing on principles from continual learning (CL) and model compression. Utilizing a task-agnostic calibration set, AIM selectively prioritizes essential weights during merging. We empirically demonstrate that AIM significantly enhances the performance of merged models across multiple benchmarks. Our findings suggest that considering the activation-space information can provide substantial advancements in the model merging strategies for LLMs, with up to a 40% increase in benchmark performance.

Abstract: Scaling reasoning capabilities beyond traditional domains such as math and coding is hindered by the lack of diverse and high-quality questions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a scalable approach for generating diverse and challenging reasoning questions, accompanied by reference answers. We present NaturalReasoning, a comprehensive dataset comprising 2.8 million questions that span multiple domains, including STEM fields (e.g., Physics, Computer Science), Economics, Social Sciences, and more. We demonstrate the utility of the questions in NaturalReasoning through knowledge distillation experiments which show that NaturalReasoning can effectively elicit and transfer reasoning capabilities from a strong teacher model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NaturalReasoning is also effective for unsupervised self-training using external reward models or self-rewarding. To foster future work, we publicly release NaturalReasoning at https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/natural_reasoning.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks do not test Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on their interactive intelligence with human users, which is vital for developing general-purpose AI assistants. We design InterFeedback, an interactive framework, which can be applied to any LMM and dataset to assess this ability autonomously. On top of this, we introduce InterFeedback-Bench which evaluates interactive intelligence using two representative datasets, MMMU-Pro and MathVerse, to test 10 different open-source LMMs. Additionally, we present InterFeedback-Human, a newly collected dataset of 120 cases designed for manually testing interactive performance in leading models such as OpenAI-o1 and Claude-Sonnet-4. Our evaluation results indicate that even the state-of-the-art LMM, OpenAI-o1, struggles to refine its responses based on human feedback, achieving an average score of less than 50%. Our findings point to the need for methods that can enhance LMMs' capabilities to interpret and benefit from feedback.

Abstract: Peer review underpins scientific progress, but it is increasingly strained by reviewer shortages and growing workloads. Large Language Models (LLMs) can automatically draft reviews now, but determining whether LLM-generated reviews are trustworthy requires systematic evaluation. Researchers have evaluated LLM reviews at either surface-level (e.g., BLEU and ROUGE) or content-level (e.g., specificity and factual accuracy). Yet it remains uncertain whether LLM-generated reviews attend to the same critical facets that human experts weigh -- the strengths and weaknesses that ultimately drive an accept-or-reject decision. We introduce a focus-level evaluation framework that operationalizes the focus as a normalized distribution of attention across predefined facets in paper reviews. Based on the framework, we developed an automatic focus-level evaluation pipeline based on two sets of facets: target (e.g., problem, method, and experiment) and aspect (e.g., validity, clarity, and novelty), leveraging 676 paper reviews (https://figshare.com/s/d5adf26c802527dd0f62) from OpenReview that consists of 3,657 strengths and weaknesses identified from human experts. The comparison of focus distributions between LLMs and human experts showed that the off-the-shelf LLMs consistently have a more biased focus towards examining technical validity while significantly overlooking novelty assessment when criticizing papers.

Abstract: This study investigated whether multimodal large language models can achieve human-like sensory grounding by examining their ability to capture perceptual strength ratings across sensory modalities. We explored how model characteristics (size, multimodal capabilities, architectural generation) influence grounding performance, distributional factor dependencies (word frequency, embeddings, feature distances), and human-model processing differences. We evaluated 21 models from four families (GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, Qwen) using 3,611 words from the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms through correlation, distance metrics, and qualitative analysis. Results showed that larger (6 out of 8 comparisons), multimodal (5 of 7), and newer models (5 of 8) generally outperformed their smaller, text-based, and older counterparts. Top models achieved 85-90% accuracy and 0.58-0.65 correlations with human ratings, demonstrating substantial similarity. Moreover, distributional factors showed minimal impact, not exceeding human dependency levels. However, despite strong alignment, models were not identical to humans, as even top performers showed differences in distance and correlation measures, with qualitative analysis revealing processing patterns related to absent sensory grounding. Additionally, it remains questionable whether introducing multimodality resolves this grounding deficit. Although multimodality improved performance, it seems to provide similar information as massive text rather than qualitatively different data, as benefits occurred across unrelated sensory dimensions and massive text-only models achieved comparable results. Our findings demonstrate that while advanced LLMs can approximate human sensory-linguistic associations through statistical learning, they still differ from human embodied cognition in processing mechanisms, even with multimodal integration.

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs), impacting downstream performance, computational cost, and efficiency. Existing LLMs rely on the classical Byte-pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm for subword tokenization that greedily merges frequent character bigrams, often leading to segmentation that does not align with linguistically meaningful units. To address this, we propose morphology-aware segmentation as a pre-tokenization step before applying BPE. To facilitate morphology-aware segmentation, we create a novel dataset for Hindi and Marathi, incorporating sandhi splitting to enhance the subword tokenization. Experiments on downstream tasks show that morphologically grounded tokenization improves machine translation and language modeling performance. Additionally, to handle the dependent vowels common in syllable-based writing systems used by Indic languages, we propose Constrained BPE (CBPE), an extension to the standard BPE algorithm incorporating script-specific constraints. In particular, CBPE handles dependent vowels to form a cohesive unit with other characters instead of occurring as a single unit. Our results show that CBPE achieves a 1.68\% reduction in fertility scores while maintaining comparable or improved downstream performance in machine translation and language modeling, offering a computationally efficient alternative to standard BPE. Moreover, to evaluate segmentation across different tokenization algorithms, we introduce a new human evaluation metric, \textit{EvalTok}, enabling more human-grounded assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve and summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI assistants. While these systems enhance user experience through coherent summaries, they obscure the individual contributions of original content creators, raising concerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of valuing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries by proposing a Shapley value-based framework for fair document valuation. Although theoretically appealing, exact Shapley value computation is prohibitively expensive at scale. To improve efficiency, we develop Cluster Shapley, a simple approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity among documents to reduce computation while maintaining attribution accuracy. Using Amazon product review data, we empirically show that off-the-shelf Shapley approximations, such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP, perform suboptimally in LLM settings, whereas Cluster Shapley substantially improves the efficiency-accuracy frontier. Moreover, simple attribution rules (e.g., equal or relevance-based allocation), though computationally cheap, lead to highly unfair outcomes. Together, our findings highlight the potential of structure-aware Shapley approximations tailored to LLM summarization and offer guidance for platforms seeking scalable and fair content attribution mechanisms.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks like reasoning or planning, play a substantial role in many cutting-edge commercial applications, and continue to fascinate researchers across fields for their potential to accomplish expensive, complex tasks that, until recently, only humans have been trusted to do. These workflows depend critically on the prompts used to provide the roles models play in such workflows. Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to approach the performance of their larger counterparts. This highlights its potential for building more cost-effective and powerful hybrid AI systems, thereby democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology, and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a 1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and +0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

Abstract: Although explainability and interpretability have received significant attention in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) for mental health, reasoning has not been examined in the same depth. Addressing this gap is essential to bridge NLP and mental health through interpretable and reasoning-capable AI systems. To this end, we investigate the pragmatic reasoning capability of large-language models (LLMs) in the mental health domain. We introduce PRiMH dataset, and propose pragmatic reasoning tasks in mental health with pragmatic implicature and presupposition phenomena. In particular, we formulate two tasks in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the tasks presented, we consider four models: Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show substantial reasoning abilities in the domain. Subsequently, we study the behavior of MentaLLaMA on the proposed reasoning tasks with the rollout attention mechanism. In addition, we also propose three StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT4o-mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with stigma more responsibly compared to the other two LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining, producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications. Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and (iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller, shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and WandB logs are released.

<title>Chain-of-Query: Unleashing the Power of LLMs in SQL-Aided Table Understanding via Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Extensive experiments across four models and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that CoQ achieves substantial accuracy improvements and significantly lowers invalid SQL rates compared to prior generic LLM-based, SQL-aided, and hybrid baselines, confirming its superior effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/ChainofQuery.

<title>DRQA: Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation for Controlling Overthinking in Reasoning Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1, have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation (DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications, including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

<title>Are Humans as Brittle as Large Language Models?</title>

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLMs) is unstable, due both to non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs. This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to prompt changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of LLMs.

<title>MetaRAG: Metamorphic Testing for Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e., confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches, such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g., pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility), allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are used in regulated and safety-critical settings, organizations need effective ways to turn policy into enforceable controls. We introduce a regulatory machine learning framework that converts unstructured design artifacts (like PRDs, TDDs, and code) into verifiable runtime guardrails. Our Policy as Prompt method reads these documents and risk controls to build a source-linked policy tree. This tree is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers for real-time runtime monitoring. The system is built to enforce least privilege and data minimization. For conformity assessment, it provides complete provenance, traceability, and audit logging, all integrated with a human-in-the-loop review process. Evaluations show our system reduces prompt-injection risk, blocks out-of-scope requests, and limits toxic outputs. It also generates auditable rationales aligned with AI governance frameworks. By treating policies as executable prompts (a policy-as-code for agents), this approach enables secure-by-design deployment, continuous compliance, and scalable AI safety and AI security assurance for regulatable ML.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.

Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM grammatical evaluation.

Abstract: As information grows exponentially, enterprises face increasing pressure to transform unstructured data into coherent, actionable insights. While autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise Deep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents (General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as validated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without any human steering. We release the EDR framework and benchmark trajectories to advance research on multi-agent reasoning applications.

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity, cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0, Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale, Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence. Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built upon the same base.

Abstract: Multimodal document retrieval aims to identify and retrieve various forms of multimodal content, such as figures, tables, charts, and layout information from extensive documents. Despite its increasing popularity, there is a notable lack of a comprehensive and robust benchmark to effectively evaluate the performance of systems in such tasks. To address this gap, this work introduces a new benchmark, named MMDocIR, that encompasses two distinct tasks: page-level and layout-level retrieval. The former evaluates the performance of identifying the most relevant pages within a long document, while the later assesses the ability of detecting specific layouts, providing a more fine-grained measure than whole-page analysis. A layout refers to a variety of elements, including textual paragraphs, equations, figures, tables, or charts. The MMDocIR benchmark comprises a rich dataset featuring 1,685 questions annotated by experts and 173,843 questions with bootstrapped labels, making it a valuable resource in multimodal document retrieval for both training and evaluation. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that (i) visual retrievers significantly outperform their text counterparts, (ii) MMDocIR training set effectively enhances the performance of multimodal document retrieval and (iii) text retrievers leveraging VLM-text significantly outperforms retrievers relying on OCR-text. Our dataset is available at https://mmdocrag.github.io/MMDocIR/.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate data analysis through executable code generation. Yet, data science tasks often admit multiple statistically valid solutions, e.g. different modeling strategies, making it critical to understand the reasoning behind analyses, not just their outcomes. While manual review of LLM-generated code can help ensure statistical soundness, it is labor-intensive and requires expertise. A more scalable approach is to evaluate the underlying workflows-the logical plans guiding code generation. However, it remains unclear how to assess whether an LLM-generated workflow supports reproducible implementations.
  To address this, we present AIRepr, an Analyst-Inspector framework for automatically evaluating and improving the reproducibility of LLM-generated data analysis workflows. Our framework is grounded in statistical principles and supports scalable, automated assessment. We introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies and benchmark them against standard prompting across 15 analyst-inspector LLM pairs and 1,032 tasks from three public benchmarks. Our findings show that workflows with higher reproducibility also yield more accurate analyses, and that reproducibility-enhancing prompts substantially improve both metrics. This work provides a foundation for transparent, reliable, and efficient human-AI collaboration in data science. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: In recent years, dense retrieval has been the focus of information retrieval (IR) research. While effective, dense retrieval produces uninterpretable dense vectors, and suffers from the drawback of large index size. Learned sparse retrieval (LSR) has emerged as promising alternative, achieving competitive retrieval performance while also being able to leverage the classical inverted index data structure for efficient retrieval. However, limited works have explored scaling LSR beyond BERT scale. In this work, we identify two challenges in training large language models (LLM) for LSR: (1) training instability during the early stage of contrastive training; (2) suboptimal performance due to pre-trained LLM's unidirectional attention. To address these challenges, we propose two corresponding techniques: (1) a lightweight adaptation training phase to eliminate training instability; (2) two model variants to enable bidirectional information. With these techniques, we are able to train LSR models with 8B scale LLM, and achieve competitive retrieval performance with reduced index size. Furthermore, we are among the first to analyze the performance-efficiency tradeoff of LLM-based LSR model through the lens of model quantization. Our findings provide insights into adapting LLMs for efficient retrieval modeling.

Abstract: Progress in image generation raises significant public security concerns. We argue that fake image detection should not operate as a "black box". Instead, an ideal approach must ensure both strong generalization and transparency. Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offers new opportunities for reasoning-based AI-generated image detection. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in comparison to traditional detection methods and human evaluators, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we design six distinct prompts and propose a framework that integrates these prompts to develop a more robust, explainable, and reasoning-driven detection system.

Abstract: Social media memes are a challenging domain for hate detection because they intertwine visual and textual cues into culturally nuanced messages. To tackle these challenges, we introduce TRACE, a hierarchical multimodal framework that leverages visually grounded context augmentation, along with a novel caption-scoring network to emphasize hate-relevant content, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of CLIP's text encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that selectively fine-tuning deeper text encoder layers significantly enhances performance compared to simpler projection-layer fine-tuning methods. Specifically, our framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (0.807) and F1-score (0.806) on the widely-used Hateful Memes dataset, matching the performance of considerably larger models while maintaining efficiency. Moreover, it achieves superior generalization on the MultiOFF offensive meme dataset (F1-score 0.673), highlighting robustness across meme categories. Additional analyses confirm that robust visual grounding and nuanced text representations significantly reduce errors caused by benign confounders. We publicly release our code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions, enhancing both training and token efficiency.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) faces dual challenges in processing lengthy multimodal documents (text, images, tables) and performing cross-modal reasoning. Current document retrieval-augmented generation (DocRAG) methods remain limited by their text-centric approaches, frequently missing critical visual information. The field also lacks robust benchmarks for assessing multimodal evidence selection and integration. We introduce MMDocRAG, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 4,055 expert-annotated QA pairs with multi-page, cross-modal evidence chains. Our framework introduces innovative metrics for evaluating multimodal quote selection and enables answers that interleave text with relevant visual elements. Through large-scale experiments with 60 VLM/LLM models and 14 retrieval systems, we identify persistent challenges in multimodal evidence retrieval, selection, and integration.Key findings reveal advanced proprietary LVMs show superior performance than open-sourced alternatives. Also, they show moderate advantages using multimodal inputs over text-only inputs, while open-source alternatives show significant performance degradation. Notably, fine-tuned LLMs achieve substantial improvements when using detailed image descriptions. MMDocRAG establishes a rigorous testing ground and provides actionable insights for developing more robust multimodal DocVQA systems. Our benchmark and code are available at https://mmdocrag.github.io/MMDocRAG/.

<title>Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression</title>

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference latency and memory load. For instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by 12.0 points on AIME 24, 8.6 on GPQA, and 9.7 on LiveCodeBench on average for an equivalent number of memory reads.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025 ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2) answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of AI assistants in healthcare.

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. We thus propose EASI for holistic Evaluation of multimodAl LLMs on Spatial Intelligence. EASI conceptualizes a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a standardized protocol for the fair evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models. In this report, we conduct the study across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence (SI), yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail even the most advanced multimodal models.

<title>Retrieval-Augmented Review Generation for Poisoning Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and imperceptibility under the practical setting. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

<title>LimiX: Unleashing Structured-Data Modeling Capability for Generalist Intelligence</title>

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured data. This report presents LimiX-16M and LimiX-2M, two instantiations of our large structured-data models (LDMs). Both models treat structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. They are pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX models across 11 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. LimiX-16M consistently surpasses strong baselines, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. Notably, LimiX-2M delivers strong results under tight compute and memory budgets. We also present the first scaling law study for LDMs, revealing how data and model scaling jointly influence downstream performance and offering quantitative guidance for tabular foundation modeling. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

<title>Low-probability Tokens Sustain Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses, signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of \textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy RL, sustaining continuous scaling across $3,000$ training steps and $81,204$ GPU-hours, where baseline entropy-control methods collapse. This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a $60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$ over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

Abstract: What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents. Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence.

<title>HugAgent: Benchmarking LLMs for Simulation of Individualized Human Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15144</link>

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has long been a central aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines, we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), which rethinks human reasoning simulation along three dimensions: (i) from averaged to individualized reasoning, (ii) from behavioral mimicry to cognitive alignment, and (iii) from vignette-based to open-ended data. The benchmark evaluates whether a model can predict a specific person's behavioral responses and the underlying reasoning dynamics in out-of-distribution scenarios, given partial evidence of their prior views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a human track that automates and scales the think-aloud method to collect ecologically valid human reasoning data, and a synthetic track for further scalability and systematic stress testing. This architecture enables low-cost, extensible expansion to new tasks and populations. Experiments with state-of-the-art language models reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the individuality of human thought. The benchmark, along with its complete data collection pipeline and companion chatbot, is open-sourced as HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/trace-your-thinking).

<title>How Do AI Agents Do Human Work? Comparing AI and Human Workflows Across Diverse Occupations</title>

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering, computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

<div> Personality Traits, Large Language Models, Controlling, Behavioural Manipulation, Transformer Layers <br />
Summary: Large Language Models possess implicit personalities in their generation, necessitating better control mechanisms. This study explores using the Big Five Personality Traits to extract hidden state activations from transformer layers and identify optimal layers for injecting trait-specific alignments. By applying low-rank subspace discovery methods, the study finds that personality traits share a low-rank subspace, enabling precise steering of model outputs without compromising fluency or general capabilities. The proposed pipeline allows for dynamic layer selection, facilitating effective integration of psychological theory into practical model alignment. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities, helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model alignment.

<div> TextGrad, TextualVerifier, automatic differentiation, verification framework, large language models <br />
Summary: <br />
TextGrad is a text-based automatic differentiation approach for composite AI systems. TextualVerifier is introduced to provide self-verification mechanisms for reasoning validity in decision making. It leverages chain-of-thought reasoning, majority voting, and large language models. The four-stage workflow includes chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and consensus aggregation. Experimental evaluation using Gemini 1.5 Pro shows significant improvements. Standalone evaluation on PRM800K demonstrates a 29% improvement in reasoning validity. Integration with TextGrad on benchmarks results in a 2.2 percentage point gain in loss function verification. TextualVerifier versioning yields further improvements on various benchmarks. This framework offers the first self-verification for TextGrad through large language model techniques, enhancing the reliability of reasoning in text-based optimization and paving the way for new verification avenues. <br /> <div>

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow: chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1) standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4 percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92 percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively. TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients, enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in text-based optimization.

Developed by a consortium of major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality, transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a 77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in a downstream task within public administration.

STARS proposes a decoding-time algorithm, Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection Sampling, to align large language models with human values efficiently. The algorithm iteratively samples, scores, and rejects/accepts fixed-size token segments to correct the generation path early. Compared to traditional methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), STARS outperforms by up to 14.9 and 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, respectively, while remaining competitive with Best-of-N baselines. This approach enhances computational efficiency and alignment quality, providing a robust alternative to fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning language models.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments. This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel approach for efficient multi-label text classification using large language models (LLMs). By reformulating classification tasks as sequences of dichotomic decisions, efficiency gains are achieved without sacrificing accuracy. The method focuses on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including emotions and sentiment. Through LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are then aggregated to fine-tune smaller models. The fine-tuned models demonstrate significant improvements over zero-shot baselines, particularly on dimensions seen during training. The study suggests that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries, combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and effective framework for LLM-based classification. While the method is validated on affective states, it is generalizable and applicable across different domains.<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently, which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B, Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries, combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

Summary:<br /><br />
The study investigates the quality of Machine Translation datasets for low-resourced languages such as Afan Oromo, Amharic, and Tigrinya, particularly focusing on gender representation. The research highlights that while the training data is rich in political and religious content, benchmark datasets mainly feature news, health, and sports. Furthermore, there is a noticeable bias towards male gender representation in names, verb genders, and stereotypical depictions. The datasets also contain harmful and toxic portrayals of women, with a significant prevalence in the language with the largest dataset size. The findings emphasize that a focus on quantity over quality in dataset collection can lead to detrimental societal biases and hinder the performance of language technologies for underrepresented languages. The study encourages further examination of datasets for low-resourced languages and early interventions to address harmful content.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research, there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo, Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality. We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content. WARNING: This paper contains discussion of NSFW content that some may find disturbing.

Summary:<br />
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD) is introduced as a method to mitigate hallucination in large language models (LLMs) without the need for retraining. It constructs a token transition graph using corpus-derived evidence, which is then used during decoding to influence generation towards more accurate outputs. GRAD outperforms baselines in various question-answering tasks, achieving higher accuracy, lower hallucination rates, and greater correctness. It effectively combines model logits with graph-retrieved evidence to steer generation towards truthful and verifiable outputs. This lightweight approach offers a plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding and knowledge graph augmentation, showcasing the importance of statistical evidence in improving the reliability and accuracy of generated text. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs, accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines, achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods. GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more truthful and verifiable outputs.

Summary: 
In a study on iterated reference games, humans and vision-language models were tested on picking out novel referents using language in varying contexts. Model performance was initially below human levels without relevant context but improved significantly with relevant information. The difficulty of few-shot reference games with abstract referents was highlighted as a challenge for machine learning models. The study emphasizes the importance of context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments for both human and machine performance. <div>

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance. Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators. Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at unprecedented resolution, offering insights into the dynamics of human flourishing as reflected in social media discourse across the United States over the past decade.

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a 2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems that share meaning rather than tokens.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases, \emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and explainability of RAG systems.

Summary: 
The article introduces a Weakly Supervised Transducer (WST) as a solution for reducing the reliance on large-scale annotated data in automatic speech recognition tasks. WST is designed to handle errors in transcripts without the need for confidence estimation or pre-trained models. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and industrial datasets demonstrate that WST maintains performance even with high transcription error rates, outperforming existing weakly supervised approaches like BTC and OTC. The results highlight the practical utility and robustness of WST in real-world ASR settings. The implementation of WST will be made publicly available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: The Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T) is widely adopted in end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks but depends heavily on large-scale, high-quality annotated data, which are often costly and difficult to obtain. To mitigate this reliance, we propose a Weakly Supervised Transducer (WST), which integrates a flexible training graph designed to robustly handle errors in the transcripts without requiring additional confidence estimation or auxiliary pre-trained models. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and industrial datasets reveal that WST effectively maintains performance even with transcription error rates of up to 70%, consistently outperforming existing Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based weakly supervised approaches, such as Bypass Temporal Classification (BTC) and Omni-Temporal Classification (OTC). These results demonstrate the practical utility and robustness of WST in realistic ASR settings. The implementation will be publicly available.

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of expert alignment in evaluating explanations provided by Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive settings such as surgery, astronomy, and therapy. Unlike current evaluation schemes that focus on plausibility or internal faithfulness of explanations, expert alignment aims to ensure that the content of explanations aligns with expert intuition. The authors propose T-FIX, a benchmark comprising seven knowledge-intensive domains, to evaluate the alignment of LLM explanations with expert judgment. Collaborating with domain experts, novel metrics are developed to measure this alignment. This approach is essential for users who are domain experts, such as doctors, astrophysicists, and psychologists, as they require explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. Overall, the article highlights the importance of expert alignment in providing meaningful explanations from LLMs in knowledge-intensive domains.

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery, astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert judgment.

Summary: 
The study introduces the Plan of Knowledge (PoK) framework to enhance Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) by leveraging structured planning and temporal knowledge retrieval. This framework decomposes complex temporal questions into sub-objectives and utilizes a contrastive temporal retriever to selectively retrieve relevant facts from Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). By combining structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK improves interpretability and factual consistency in temporal reasoning tasks. Experimental results on benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly boosts retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs), outperforming state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by up to 56.0%. <div>
arXiv:2511.04072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress, benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store (TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

<br />
The study compares word associations between humans and large language models, focusing on emotionally loaded words. It finds that while there is moderate overlap between the two, LLMs tend to amplify the emotional load of stimuli and generate less creative associations compared to humans. Human responses are influenced by personal experience, emotions, and cognitive styles, leading to unpredictable associations. In contrast, LLM associations are more predictable and less creative. The ability to form associative links between unrelated concepts is crucial for creativity, with humans displaying a higher level of creativity in associations compared to LLMs. This study sheds light on the differences in associative behavior between humans and LLMs, highlighting the importance of understanding the nuances of word associations in gaining insight into the internal mental lexicon. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

Summary: 
Large-scale, transformer-based models were utilized to enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports. The models were fine-tuned on annotated radiology corpora from Stanford University, improving PHI detection across multiple categories. The model achieved high F1 scores on test sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania, surpassing previous state-of-the-art performance. Synthetic PHI generation proved to be consistent in detectability and outperformed commercial vendor systems in PHI detection. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of large-scale, multimodal training in improving cross-institutional generalization and robustness. The transformer-based model established a new benchmark for secure clinical text processing. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT, abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50 independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754). Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical text processing.

Summary: 
- The study focuses on language identification in the limit, exploring the possibility of correctly guessing the target language after a finite time.
- While classical results by Gold showed the impossibility of language identification in the limit for various language sets, Angluin provided a specific characterization for achievable tasks.
- The research introduces the concept of $k$-list identification, where the learner can provide a list of $k$ guesses at each time step to ensure correctness beyond a finite time.
- An exact characterization is presented for language collections that can be $k$-list identified in the limit, building on Angluin's initial framework.
- The findings establish rates for list identification in the statistical setting, demonstrating that exponential rates can be achieved for $k$-list identification in the limit, while collections that are not $k$-list identifiable cannot be identified at any rate approaching zero.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise characterization of language collections for which this task is possible. Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of $k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be $k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be $k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

Summary:
Batch prompting is not only effective for amortizing inference cost in large language models (LLMs) but also serves as a regularization technique for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Through a study across 13 benchmarks, it was found that batching improves accuracy while significantly reducing reasoning token usage. The benefits of batching include suppressing overthinking, reducing hedging language, and encouraging more decisive answers during multi-step reasoning. Additionally, batched inference shows collective effects where models generalize patterns from earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings highlight the importance of batching as a powerful inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning. <div>

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by 3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

Summary: <br />
Large language models have shown high performance in mathematical reasoning tasks, but the results may not always reflect genuine reasoning abilities, potentially due to training data leakage or superficial pattern matching. To address this, the authors introduce RIDE, an adversarial question-rewriting framework that utilizes Item Response Theory to generate more challenging and well-posed mathematical questions. By simulating students with 35 LLMs and building a difficulty ranker, RIDE successfully reformulates existing questions across difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks reveals a significant decrease in LLM performance, indicating limited robustness in mathematical reasoning. This approach provides a rigorous evaluation method that exposes weaknesses in current LLM capabilities and highlights the importance of genuine reasoning skills in solving mathematical problems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.04120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems. We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our evaluation approach.

Summary: 
CantoASR introduces a collaborative error correction framework for low-resource Cantonese speech recognition. It addresses challenges such as limited annotated data, complex tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. The framework integrates forced alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for prosody-aware correction. By combining acoustic cues with large audio-language models (LALMs), CantoASR achieves significant gains in Character Error Rate (CER) compared to existing models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging broader contextual reasoning while incorporating tonal and prosodic cues in ASR. This approach offers a scalable strategy for improving tonal and dialectal ASR in low-resource languages like Cantonese. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility, yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data, six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR, a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

Summary: 

Text-to-SQL systems aim to provide a natural language interface for accessing database information but face challenges with complex SQL generation. This study explores three multi-agent Large Language Model pipelines for SQL generation: Multi-agent discussion, Planner-Coder, and Coder-Aggregator. Benchmarked on open-source models, results show that Multi-agent discussion can improve small model performance, with a notable increase in Execution Accuracy. The LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline stands out as the most effective, showcasing improvements in SQL generation accuracy. The experiments conducted on the Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set demonstrate the potential of these multi-agent approaches in enhancing SQL generation from natural language instructions. Further details and codes for the pipelines can be found on the provided GitHub repository. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller, efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3) Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines, the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest score of 56.4%.

<div> trustworthiness, LAAC, communication, LLMs, information capture<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper discusses the role of LLMs in communication processes, highlighting the issue of AI-generated content inflation and compression. The proposed LAAC paradigm suggests using LLMs as intelligent intermediaries to facilitate genuine knowledge exchange. It explores the trustworthiness requirements for deploying LAAC in various communication domains, focusing on information capture fidelity, reproducibility, and query response integrity. Preliminary findings from controlled experiments using LAAC's multi-agent architecture reveal trust gaps that need to be addressed before reliable deployment in high-stakes scenarios. <div>

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content, recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator) proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals, professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction during sender interviews across different communication types, (2) Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases, we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture. Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

<div> Keywords: large language models, validation, computational Turing test, calibration, human-likeness <br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces a computational Turing test framework for validating large language models (LLMs) in simulating human behavior. It compares nine LLMs using five calibration strategies across different social media platforms. The findings challenge existing assumptions, showing that even calibrated LLM outputs are distinguishable from human text, especially in affective tone and emotional expression. Instruction-tuned models perform poorly compared to base models, and increasing model size does not improve human-likeness. There is a trade-off between optimizing for human-likeness and semantic fidelity. The study provides a scalable framework for validating and calibrating LLM simulations but warns about the limitations in capturing human communication. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested. Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations -- testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset. Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval -- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression. Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off: optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

Summary:
Language models were tested to see if they could pass Poland's National Appeal Chamber membership exam. While they did well in the knowledge test, they struggled with the practical written portion and differed in judgment from the official committee. Limitations included hallucinations, incorrect legal citations, weak argumentation, and the need for collaboration between legal and technical experts. This indicates that current language models cannot yet replace human judges or examiners in Polish public procurement adjudication. 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the 'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4 Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the 'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners in Polish public procurement adjudication.

<div> Keywords: Machine unlearning, privacy, safety, regulatory compliance, REMIND evaluation method

Summary:
Machine unlearning, crucial for privacy, safety, and compliance, aims to remove specific training data without retraining. Existing evaluation methods may overlook residual influence in similar examples. A novel evaluation method, REMIND, detects subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classifies if data is forgotten effectively. REMIND analyzes loss over input variations, showing unlearned data yielding flatter loss landscapes, while retained or unrelated data display sharper patterns. REMIND, requiring only query-based access, outperforms existing methods and is robust across models, datasets, and inputs. It offers a more sensitive and interpretable measure of unlearning effectiveness, providing a reliable framework to assess unlearning in language models. By offering a new perspective on memorization and unlearning, REMIND enhances trustworthiness and reliability in machine unlearning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND (Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models, datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective on memorization and unlearning.

<div> pre-training, retrieval, generation, dataset value, compute<br />
Summary:<br />
The study investigates the efficiency of current pre-training methods in extracting ideas and knowledge from the data. By using retrieval augmented generation and test-time compute, the researchers quantify the value left behind in pre-training processes and its impact across different scales. Results show significant accuracy gains in various tasks such as MMLU, Math-500, and SimpleQA when leveraging retrieval from standard datasets. The study reveals that retrieval acts as a 5x compute multiplier compared to pre-training alone for MMLU. Additional compute at test time further improves results, with a 10 percentage point enhancement on MMLU for the LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, the findings suggest that current pre-training methods do not fully utilize the information within pre-training datasets, indicating room for advancement in the field. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500, and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for progress.

Summary: 

- The article proposes a graph-based approach for topic labeling in text analysis to enhance interpretability without intensive computational requirements.
- Topic modeling is used to automatically discover topics in text data, but the resulting word distributions lack clear interpretability.
- The graph-based approach enriches topic words with semantically related terms and explores their relationships to derive meaningful labels.
- Comparative study with benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, shows that the proposed method outperforms traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity while remaining computationally efficient.
- Future directions for topic labeling research are discussed, emphasizing the potential for enhancing interpretability and automation. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient. Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

<br />
Summary: This paper introduces SSPO, a new algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR). SSPO addresses the shortcomings of existing algorithms such as GRPO and GSPO by applying a sentence-level importance ratio, striking a balance between the two approaches. By avoiding training collapse, high variance, and low data utilization, SSPO outperforms GRPO and GSPO, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. Additionally, the integration of sentence entropy in the PPO-CLIP algorithm allows for steady adjustment of clipping bounds, promoting exploration of high-entropy tokens while narrowing the clipping range for low-entropy tokens. These advancements highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data and improving reasoning skills in LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs' reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data, respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level, which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean, leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a data selection methodology to enhance the effectiveness of fine-tuning machine translation systems. It utilizes a learner model and a pre-trained reference model to evaluate the utility of data points through a learnability score. By selecting the most relevant examples, the method improves training efficiency. The batch selection strategy considers interdependencies among data points, optimizing the training process. Experimental results on various language pairs with an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset show up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared to a baseline. The approach also enhances computational efficiency by requiring fewer training data points, especially when using cached embeddings. The method leads to improved generalization and superior translation performance compared to random selection, showcasing its effectiveness in improving machine translation models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points, optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality. A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware forecasting.

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks. Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented, especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising 2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models. Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document understanding.

Summary:
RUST-BENCH is a new benchmark that aims to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on the complexity of real-world tabular data. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on small, uniform tables, RUST-BENCH includes 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables in two domains: RB-Science and RB-Sports. It tests models on scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity. Findings suggest that LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, highlighting weaknesses in current architectures. The benchmark serves as a challenging testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research, prompting the need for new strategies to improve LLM performance on real-world data.

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records) and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies. RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research.

<div> LLM-prompting-based, text simplification, performance, CEFR levels, multi-round simplification <br />
Summary: 
The OUNLP system was developed for readability-controlled text simplification for the TSAR-2025 Shared Task. The performance of text simplification was found to be influenced by the gap between source and target CEFR levels. Two multi-round simplification methods, MRS-Rule and MRS-Joint, were proposed and generated using GPT-4o. The system ranked 7th out of 20 teams initially, with MRS-Joint showing improved performance in subsequent evaluations. Taking LLM-simplified candidates as starting points was found to enhance multi-round simplification effectiveness. <div>

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task (Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams. Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round simplification performance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly important for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further, hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait profiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence of personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model tuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems.

<div> Framework, Evaluation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), Domain-specific

Summary:
RAGalyst is introduced as an automated, human-aligned agentic framework for evaluating domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The framework generates synthetic question-answering datasets and refines LLM-as-a-Judge metrics for improved alignment with human judgment. Evaluation across military operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering domains reveals context-dependent performance, emphasizing the importance of domain-specific considerations. No universally optimal model or configuration is identified, highlighting the need for systematic evaluation frameworks like RAGalyst to inform design decisions for reliable RAG systems. An analysis of common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG underlines the framework's value in uncovering domain-specific trade-offs. RAGalyst is available on Github. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in specialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA) datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst, which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems. RAGalyst is available on our Github.

<div> Keywords: Radiology reports, Uncertainty, Hedging phrases, LLM-based ranking, Diagnostic pathways

Summary: 
- Radiology reports play a crucial role in clinical decision-making and can benefit from automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
- Uncertainty in radiology reports is categorized into explicit uncertainty, conveyed through hedging phrases, and implicit uncertainty, where parts of reasoning are omitted by radiologists.
- An expert-validated, LLM-based reference ranking is used to quantify explicit uncertainty by mapping each finding to a probability value based on common hedging phrases.
- Implicit uncertainty is addressed through an expansion framework that adds characteristic sub-findings derived from diagnostic pathways for common diagnoses.
- Lunguage++, an expanded, uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark, is introduced as a resource for uncertainty-aware image classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and exploration of the clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats. These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated, LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for 14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded, uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

<div> Keywords: language model, uncertainty quantification, hidden activations, chain-of-thought reasoning, intervention

Summary:
In this paper, the authors investigate how language models navigate through different reasoning paths during text generation and the associated uncertainty. By analyzing hidden activations, they explore the model's ability to represent alternate paths and quantify uncertainty. The experiments reveal a strong correlation between the model's uncertainty at different points and its responsiveness to activation interventions. This implies that effective interventions can steer the model when diverse paths are available, indicating a lack of commitment to a specific outcome. The study also shows that hidden activations can predict the model's future outcome distribution, indicating the representation of potential paths by the model. These findings highlight the significance of understanding how language models reason and make decisions, offering insights into enhancing their performance and interpretability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens, and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) play a crucial role in software development but also introduce new vulnerabilities in code. Despite efforts to improve code security benchmarks, vulnerabilities still exist in widely used coding LLMs. This study reveals that even the latest open-weight models are susceptible to vulnerabilities, indicating a trade-off between safety and functionality hindering effective patching. A new severity metric incorporating Prompt Exposure (PE) is introduced to assess the risk of LLM-generated vulnerabilities, leading to the Model Exposure (ME) score. ME reflects the severity and prevalence of vulnerabilities generated by a model, aiming to prioritize mitigation efforts for the most serious and common vulnerabilities. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to enhance the overall cybersecurity landscape in software development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in software development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they generate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of vulnerabilities a model generates.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates robust yet computationally efficient fact verification systems. While current state-of-the-art approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales, these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95% on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92% on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds), showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC dataset, DeReC achieves an F1 score of 65.58%, surpassing the state-of-the-art method L-Defense (61.20%). Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered retrieval-based systems can match or exceed LLM performance in specialized tasks while being significantly more practical for real-world deployment.

The article introduces LEASH, a Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic that improves complex reasoning in language models without the need for additional training. LEASH monitors token-level entropy and top-logit margin improvement to determine when to halt rationale generation, reducing token usage by 30-35% and latency by 27%. While there is a slight accuracy drop compared to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, LEASH offers a more efficient alternative. It is model-agnostic, requiring no extra training, making it a simple and effective solution for enhancing reasoning capabilities in language models. <div>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a key technique for enabling complex reasoning in large language models. However, generating full, fixed-length rationales is computationally wasteful, inflating both token usage and latency. We introduce LEASH: Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic, a training-free decoding algorithm that adaptively halts rationale generation. LEASH monitors two intrinsic signals: the slope of token-level entropy and the improvement in the top-logit margin. It terminates the generation once both signals plateau, indicating the model has reached a stable reasoning state. Across four instruction-tuned models on the GSM8K and AQuA-RAT benchmarks, LEASH reduces average token generation by 30--35% and latency by 27%, while incurring a 10 p.p. accuracy drop relative to CoT. LEASH is model-agnostic and requires no additional training or supervision, offering a simple and efficient alternative to CoT decoding.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models, systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics. Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis, contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model (NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

Experiments show that MIDI-LLM achieves higher quality, better text control, and faster inference compared to the recent Text2midi model. Live demo at https://midi-llm-demo.vercel.app.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel collaborative multi-agent framework for automatic question generation in mathematics education. The approach aims to improve control over problem complexity and cognitive demands compared to existing transformer-based language models. Multiple agents work together to refine question-answer pairs iteratively, balancing complexity and cognitive challenge. Evaluation criteria include relevance, importance, clarity, difficulty matching, and answerability. Preliminary results indicate that the collaborative multi-agent framework enhances the quality of generated educational content by achieving a more nuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity.

Abstract: Automatic question generation (AQG) for mathematics education remains an elusive goal for Intelligent Tutoring Systems and educators. While pre-trained transformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language generation, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and cognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative multi-agent framework as a novel method of incorporating inference-time computation into AQG. This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated question-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We evaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance, importance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's ability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions. Preliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework elevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more nuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising outcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield more controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated educational content generation and adaptive learning environments.

<title>LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing</title>

<div> LLMs, cultural values, prompt language, cultural framing, model responses<br />
Summary:<br />
This study investigates the impact of prompt language and cultural framing on Large Language Models (LLMs) regarding alignment with cultural values. Testing 10 LLMs with prompts translated into 11 languages, the study finds that while prompt language and cultural perspective influence LLM outputs, the models are biased towards the values of a limited set of countries – the Netherlands, Germany, the US, and Japan. LLMs tend to produce neutral responses with some progressive stances, notably on social tolerance. Cultural framing improves alignment with human values more than prompt language alone, but combining both approaches does not enhance effectiveness. The findings suggest that LLMs are responsive to prompt changes but are anchored in specific cultural defaults, limiting their ability to represent cultural diversity effectively.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study, we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat: While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US, and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly, combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation, but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent cultural diversity.

Abstract: Decision trees are widely used in high-stakes fields like finance and healthcare due to their interpretability. This work introduces an efficient, scalable method for generating synthetic pre-training data to enable meta-learning of decision trees. Our approach samples near-optimal decision trees synthetically, creating large-scale, realistic datasets. Using the MetaTree transformer architecture, we demonstrate that this method achieves performance comparable to pre-training on real-world data or with computationally expensive optimal decision trees. This strategy significantly reduces computational costs, enhances data generation flexibility, and paves the way for scalable and efficient meta-learning of interpretable decision tree models.

<title>Explorability in Pushdown Automata</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We study explorability, a measure of nondeterminism in pushdown automata, which generalises history-determinism. An automaton is k-explorable if, while reading the input, it suffices to follow k concurrent runs, built step-by-step based only on the input seen so far, to construct an accepting one, if it exists. We show that the class of explorable PDAs lies strictly between history-deterministic and fully nondeterministic PDAs in terms of both expressiveness and succinctness. In fact increasing explorability induces an infinite hierarchy: each level k defines a strictly more expressive class than level k-1, yet the entire class remains less expressive than general nondeterministic PDAs. We then introduce a parameterized notion of explorability, where the number of runs may depend on input length, and show that exponential explorability precisely captures the context-free languages. Finally, we prove that explorable PDAs can be doubly exponentially more succinct than history-deterministic ones, and that the succinctness gap between deterministic and 2-explorable PDAs is not recursively enumerable. These results position explorability as a robust and operationally meaningful measure of nondeterminism for pushdown systems.

<title>DartQuant: Efficient Rotational Distribution Calibration for LLM Quantization</title>

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model. Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at https://github.com/CAS-CLab/DartQuant.git.

<title>Sub-exponential Growth in Online Word Usage: A Piecewise Power-Law Model</title>

Abstract: The diffusion of ideas and language in society has conventionally been described by S-shaped models, such as the logistic curve. However, the role of sub-exponential growth -a slower than exponential pattern known in epidemiology- has been largely overlooked in broader social phenomena. Here, we present a piecewise power-law model to characterize complex growth curves with a few parameters. We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of approximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia vocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English, Spanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of the 2,965 selected items reveals that about 55% (1,625 items) were found to have no abrupt jumps and were well captured by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i) the mode of the shape parameter alpha was near 0.5, indicating prevalent sub-exponential growth; (ii) the ultimate diffusion scale is primarily determined by the growth rate R, with minor contributions from alpha or the duration T; and (iii) alpha showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the topic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones. Furthermore, a micro-behavioral model distinguishing outward contact with strangers from inward interaction within their community suggests that alpha can be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented communication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common pattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for consistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth curves.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture. In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii) ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in the simulated real-world setting.

Abstract: University students face immense challenges during their undergraduate lives, often being deprived of personalized on-demand guidance that mentors fail to provide at scale. Digital tools exist, but there is a serious lack of customized coaching for newcomers. This paper presents an AI-powered chatbot that will serve as a mentor for the students of BRAC University. The main component is a data ingestion pipeline that efficiently processes and updates information from diverse sources, such as CSV files and university webpages. The chatbot retrieves information through a hybrid approach, combining BM25 lexical ranking with ChromaDB semantic retrieval, and uses a Large Language Model, LLaMA-3.3-70B, to generate conversational responses. The generated text was found to be semantically highly relevant, with a BERTScore of 0.831 and a METEOR score of 0.809. The data pipeline was also very efficient, taking 106.82 seconds for updates, compared to 368.62 seconds for new data. This chatbot will be able to help students by responding to their queries, helping them to get a better understanding of university life, and assisting them to plan better routines for their semester in the open-credit university.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge. While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)-- raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work, we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format. Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict, tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two) block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research under emerging low-precision formats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly employ guardrails to enforce ethical, legal, and application-specific constraints on their outputs. While effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3, and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model, and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of current modeling paradigms.

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval. We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood. This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

Abstract: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1) Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration, we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks, Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU. Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model, positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

Abstract: Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end, we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations, formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science, a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI Scientist development.

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved. Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act. By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient collaboration strategies.

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context, commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps. Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for (1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards, further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.

Abstract: Probing the multilingual knowledge of linguistic structure in LLMs, often characterized as sequence labeling, faces challenges with maintaining output templates in current text-to-text prompting strategies. To solve this, we introduce a decomposed prompting approach for sequence labeling tasks. Diverging from the single text-to-text prompt, our prompt method generates for each token of the input sentence an individual prompt which asks for its linguistic label. We test our method on the Universal Dependencies part-of-speech tagging dataset for 38 languages, using both English-centric and multilingual LLMs. Our findings show that decomposed prompting surpasses the iterative prompting baseline in efficacy and efficiency under zero- and few-shot settings. Moreover, our analysis of multilingual performance of English-centric LLMs yields insights into the transferability of linguistic knowledge via multilingual prompting.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many tasks, there has been extensive research on undesirable model behavior such as hallucinations and bias. In this work, we investigate how the quality of LLM responses changes in terms of information accuracy, truthfulness, and refusals depending on three user traits: English proficiency, education level, and country of origin. We present extensive experimentation on three state-of-the-art LLMs and two different datasets targeting truthfulness and factuality. Our findings suggest that undesirable behaviors in state-of-the-art LLMs occur disproportionately more for users with lower English proficiency, of lower education status, and originating from outside the US, rendering these models unreliable sources of information towards their most vulnerable users.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP), which enables litigants and their lawyers to forecast judgment outcomes and refine litigation strategies, has emerged as a crucial legal NLP task. Existing studies typically utilize legal facts, i.e., facts that have been established by evidence and determined by the judge, to predict the judgment. However, legal facts are often difficult to obtain in the early stages of litigation, significantly limiting the practical applicability of fact-based LJP. To address this limitation, we propose a novel legal NLP task: legal fact prediction (LFP), which takes the evidence submitted by litigants for trial as input to predict legal facts, thereby empowering fact-based LJP technologies to make predictions in the absence of ground-truth legal facts. We also propose the first benchmark dataset, LFPBench, for evaluating the LFP task. Our extensive experiments on LFPBench demonstrate the effectiveness of LFP-empowered LJP and highlight promising research directions for LFP.

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they inevitably suffer from hallucination. As we know, both the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) decoder in LVLMs are Transformer-based, allowing the model to extract visual information and generate text outputs via attention mechanisms. We find that the attention distribution of LLM decoder on image tokens is highly consistent with the visual encoder and both distributions tend to focus on particular background tokens rather than the referred objects in the image. We attribute to the unexpected attention distribution to an inherent flaw in the visual encoder itself, which misguides LLMs to over emphasize the redundant information and generate object hallucination. To address the issue, we propose DAMRO, a novel training-free strategy that $D$ive into $A$ttention $M$echanism of LVLM to $R$educe $O$bject Hallucination. Specifically, our approach employs classification token (CLS) of ViT to filter out high-attention outlier tokens scattered in the background and then eliminate their influence during decoding stage. We evaluate our method on LVLMs including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT and InstructBLIP, using various benchmarks such as POPE, CHAIR, MME and GPT-4V Aided Evaluation. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the impact of these outlier tokens, thus effectively alleviating the hallucination of LVLMs. The code is released at https://github.com/coder-gx/DAMRO.

Abstract: The syntactic structure of a sentence can be described as a tree that indicates the syntactic relationships between words. In spite of significant progress in unsupervised methods that retrieve the syntactic structure of sentences, guessing the right direction of edges is still a challenge. As in a syntactic dependency structure edges are oriented away from the root, the challenge of guessing the right direction can be reduced to finding an undirected tree and the root. The limited performance of current unsupervised methods demonstrates the lack of a proper understanding of what a root vertex is from first principles. We consider an ensemble of centrality scores, some that only take into account the free tree (non-spatial scores) and others that take into account the position of vertices (spatial scores). We test the hypothesis that the root vertex is an important or central vertex of the syntactic dependency structure. We confirm the hypothesis in the sense that root vertices tend to have high centrality and that vertices of high centrality tend to be roots. The best performance in guessing the root is achieved by novel scores that only take into account the position of a vertex and that of its neighbours. We provide theoretical and empirical foundations towards a universal notion of rootness from a network science perspective.

Abstract: Recent interest in building foundation models for KGs has highlighted a fundamental challenge: knowledge-graph data is relatively scarce. The best-known KGs are primarily human-labeled, created by pattern-matching, or extracted using early NLP techniques. While human-generated KGs are in short supply, automatically extracted KGs are of questionable quality. We present a solution to this data scarcity problem in the form of a text-to-KG generator (KGGen), a package that uses language models to create high-quality graphs from plaintext. Unlike other KG extractors, KGGen clusters related entities to reduce sparsity in extracted KGs. KGGen is available as a Python library (\texttt{pip install kg-gen}), making it accessible to everyone. Along with KGGen, we release the first benchmark, Measure of of Information in Nodes and Edges (MINE), that tests an extractor's ability to produce a useful KG from plain text. We benchmark our new tool against existing extractors and demonstrate far superior performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in translating natural language (NL) instructions into program code. However, user instructions often contain inherent ambiguities, making it challenging for LLMs to generate code that accurately reflects the user's true intent. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed approaches that produce multiple candidates of the program code and then rerank them to identify the best solution. In this paper, we propose CodeRSA, a novel code candidate reranking mechanism built upon the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, designed to guide LLMs toward more comprehensive pragmatic reasoning about user intent. We evaluate CodeRSA using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct on two widely used code generation benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP. Our experiment results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into code candidate reranking, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs.

Abstract: Automated fact-checking aims to assess the truthfulness of textual claims based on relevant evidence. However, verifying complex claims that require multi-hop reasoning remains a significant challenge. We propose GraphCheck, a novel framework that transforms claims into entity-relationship graphs for structured and systematic fact-checking. By explicitly modeling both explicit and latent entities and exploring multiple reasoning paths, GraphCheck enhances verification robustness. While GraphCheck excels in complex scenarios, it may be unnecessarily elaborate for simpler claims. To address this, we introduce DP-GraphCheck, a variant that employs a lightweight strategy selector to choose between direct prompting and GraphCheck adaptively. This selective mechanism improves both accuracy and efficiency by applying the appropriate level of reasoning to each claim. Experiments on the HOVER and EX-FEVER datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in verification accuracy, while achieving strong computational efficiency despite its multipath exploration. Moreover, the strategy selection mechanism in DP-GraphCheck generalizes well to other fact-checking pipelines, highlighting the broad applicability of our framework.

Abstract: Data filtering has become a powerful tool for improving model performance while reducing computational cost. However, as large language model compute budgets continue to grow, the limited data volume provided by heavily filtered and deduplicated datasets will become a practical constraint. In efforts to better understand how to proceed, we study model performance at various compute budgets and across multiple pre-training datasets created through data filtering and deduplication. We find that, given appropriate modifications to the training recipe, repeating existing aggressively filtered datasets for up to ten epochs can outperform training on the ten times larger superset for a single epoch across multiple compute budget orders of magnitude. While this finding relies on repeating the dataset for many epochs, we also investigate repeats within these datasets at the document level. We find that not all documents within a dataset are equal, and we can create better datasets relative to a token budget by explicitly manipulating the counts of individual documents. We conclude by arguing that even as large language models scale, data filtering remains an important direction of research.

Abstract: Modern LLMs struggle with efficient updates, as each new pretrained model version requires repeating expensive alignment processes. This challenge also applies to domain- or languagespecific models, where fine-tuning on specialized data must be redone for every new base model release. In this paper, we explore the transfer of fine-tuning updates between model versions. Specifically, we derive the diff vector (representing the weight changes from finetuning) from one source model version and apply it to the base model of a different target version. Through empirical evaluations on various open-weight model versions, we show that transferring diff vectors can significantly improve the performance of the target base model. For example, transferring the fine-tuning updates from Llama 3.0 8B improves Llama 3.1 8B by 46.9% on IFEval and 15.7% on LiveCodeBench without additional training, even surpassing Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. Furthermore, we demonstrate performance gains on multilingual tasks, with 4.7% and 15.5% improvements on Global MMLU for Malagasy and Turkish, respectively. We observe that these merged models provide stronger initializations for further fine-tuning. Lastly, our controlled experiments suggest that fine-tuning transfer is most effective when source and target models lie in a linearly connected region of parameter space, and we provide a theoretical analysis of our method. Taken together, fine-tuning transfer offers a cost-efficient and practical strategy for continuous LLM development. Our code is available at github.com/pjlintw/finetuning-transfer.

Abstract: In the landscape of Fact-based Judgment Prediction and Explanation (FJPE), reliance on factual data is essential for developing robust and realistic AI-driven decision-making tools. This paper introduces TathyaNyaya, the largest annotated dataset for FJPE tailored to the Indian legal context, encompassing judgments from the Supreme Court of India and various High Courts. Derived from the Hindi terms "Tathya" (fact) and "Nyaya" (justice), the TathyaNyaya dataset is uniquely designed to focus on factual statements rather than complete legal texts, reflecting real-world judicial processes where factual data drives outcomes. Complementing this dataset, we present FactLegalLlama, an instruction-tuned variant of the LLaMa-3-8B Large Language Model (LLM), optimized for generating high-quality explanations in FJPE tasks. Finetuned on the factual data in TathyaNyaya, FactLegalLlama integrates predictive accuracy with coherent, contextually relevant explanations, addressing the critical need for transparency and interpretability in AI-assisted legal systems. Our methodology combines transformers for binary judgment prediction with FactLegalLlama for explanation generation, creating a robust framework for advancing FJPE in the Indian legal domain. TathyaNyaya not only surpasses existing datasets in scale and diversity but also establishes a benchmark for building explainable AI systems in legal analysis. The findings underscore the importance of factual precision and domain-specific tuning in enhancing predictive performance and interpretability, positioning TathyaNyaya and FactLegalLlama as foundational resources for AI-assisted legal decision-making.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in external context, yet large language models (LLMs) still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions even when provided with relevant context. This paper presents two complementary efforts at Vectara to measure and benchmark LLM faithfulness in RAG. First, we describe our original hallucination leaderboard, which has tracked hallucination rates for LLMs since 2023 using our HHEM hallucination detection model. Motivated by limitations observed in current hallucination detection methods, we introduce FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge framework that leverages a pool of diverse human-annotated hallucination examples to substantially improve the automated hallucination evaluation of LLMs. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge that benchmarks LLMs on RAG faithfulness in summarization, question-answering, and data-to-text generation tasks. FaithJudge enables a more reliable benchmarking of LLM hallucinations in RAG and supports the development of more trustworthy generative AI systems: https://github.com/vectara/FaithJudge.

Abstract: Traditional dialogue summarization primarily focuses on dialogue content, assuming it comprises adequate information for a clear summary. However, this assumption often fails for discussions grounded in shared background, where participants frequently omit context and use implicit references. This results in summaries that are confusing to readers unfamiliar with the background. To address this, we introduce Knowledge-Grounded Discussion Summarization (KGDS), a novel task that produces a supplementary background summary for context and a clear opinion summary with clarified references. To facilitate research, we construct the first KGDS benchmark, featuring news-discussion pairs and expert-created multi-granularity gold annotations for evaluating sub-summaries. We also propose a novel hierarchical evaluation framework with fine-grained and interpretable metrics. Our extensive evaluation of 12 advanced large language models (LLMs) reveals that KGDS remains a significant challenge. The models frequently miss key facts and retain irrelevant ones in background summarization, and often fail to resolve implicit references in opinion summary integration.

Abstract: In this paper, we combine two-step knowledge distillation, structured pruning, truncation, and vocabulary trimming for extremely compressing multilingual encoder-only language models for low-resource languages. Our novel approach systematically combines existing techniques and takes them to the extreme, reducing layer depth, feed-forward hidden size, and intermediate layer embedding size to create significantly smaller monolingual models while retaining essential language-specific knowledge. We achieve compression rates of up to 92% while maintaining competitive performance, with average drops of 2-10% for moderate compression and 8-13% at maximum compression in four downstream tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging, across three low-resource languages. Notably, the performance degradation correlates with the amount of language-specific data in the teacher model, with larger datasets resulting in smaller performance losses. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to identify the best practices for multilingual model compression using these techniques.

<title>Compression Hacking: A Supplementary Perspective on Informatics Properties of Language Models from Geometric Distortion</title>

Abstract: Recently, the concept of ``compression as intelligence'' has provided a novel informatics metric perspective for language models (LMs), emphasizing that highly structured representations signify the intelligence level of LMs. However, from a geometric standpoint, the word representation space of highly compressed LMs tends to degenerate into a highly anisotropic state, which hinders the LM's ability to comprehend instructions and directly impacts its performance. We found this compression-anisotropy synchronicity is essentially the ``Compression Hacking'' in LM representations, where noise-dominated directions tend to create the illusion of high compression rates by sacrificing spatial uniformity. Based on this, we propose three refined compression metrics by incorporating geometric distortion analysis and integrate them into a self-evaluation pipeline. The refined metrics exhibit strong alignment with the LM's comprehensive capabilities, achieving Spearman correlation coefficients above 0.9, significantly outperforming both the original compression and other internal structure-based metrics. This confirms that compression hacking substantially enhances the informatics interpretation of LMs by incorporating geometric distortion of representations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising cornerstone for the development of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, ensuring the robustness of LLMs remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges and advance the field, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of current studies in this area. First, we systematically examine the nature of robustness in LLMs, including its conceptual foundations, the importance of consistent performance across diverse inputs, and the implications of failure modes in real-world applications. Next, we analyze the sources of non-robustness, categorizing intrinsic model limitations, data-driven vulnerabilities, and external adversarial factors that compromise reliability. Following this, we review state-of-the-art mitigation strategies, and then we discuss widely adopted benchmarks, emerging metrics, and persistent gaps in assessing real-world reliability. Finally, we synthesize findings from existing surveys and interdisciplinary studies to highlight trends, unresolved issues, and pathways for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced in reasoning tasks through reinforcement learning (RL) optimization, achieving impressive capabilities across various challenging benchmarks. However, our empirical analysis reveals a critical drawback: reasoning-oriented RL fine-tuning significantly increases the prevalence of hallucinations. We theoretically analyze the RL training dynamics, identifying high-variance gradient, entropy-induced randomness, and susceptibility to spurious local optima as key factors leading to hallucinations. To address this drawback, we propose Factuality-aware Step-wise Policy Optimization (FSPO), an innovative RL fine-tuning algorithm incorporating explicit factuality verification at each reasoning step. FSPO leverages automated verification against given evidence to dynamically adjust token-level advantage values, incentivizing factual correctness throughout the reasoning process. Experiments across mathematical reasoning and hallucination benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Llama models demonstrate that FSPO effectively reduces hallucinations while enhancing reasoning accuracy, substantially improving both reliability and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive similar attention weights ({\it local homogeneity}), adjacent values demonstrate distinct {\it heterogeneous} distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.Our code can be found in this link:https://github.com/the-scale-lab/Asymkv.

Abstract: We introduce TurBLiMP, the first Turkish benchmark of linguistic minimal pairs, designed to evaluate the linguistic abilities of monolingual and multilingual language models (LMs). Covering 16 linguistic phenomena with 1000 minimal pairs each, TurBLiMP fills an important gap in linguistic evaluation resources for Turkish. In designing the benchmark, we give extra attention to two properties of Turkish that remain understudied in current syntactic evaluations of LMs, namely word order flexibility and subordination through morphological processes. Our experiments on a wide range of LMs and a newly collected set of human acceptability judgments reveal that even cutting-edge Large LMs still struggle with grammatical phenomena that are not challenging for humans, and may also exhibit different sensitivities to word order and morphological complexity compared to humans.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs' knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning. Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

Abstract: The proliferation of unstructured data poses a fundamental challenge to traditional database interfaces. While Text-to-SQL has democratized access to structured data, it remains incapable of interpreting semantic or multi-modal queries. Concurrently, vector search has emerged as the de facto standard for querying unstructured data, but its integration with SQL-termed VectorSQL-still relies on manual query crafting and lacks standardized evaluation methodologies, creating a significant gap between its potential and practical application.
  To bridge this fundamental gap, we introduce and formalize Text2VectorSQL, a novel task to establish a unified natural language interface for seamlessly querying both structured and unstructured data. To catalyze research in this new domain, we present a comprehensive foundational ecosystem, including: (1) A scalable and robust pipeline for synthesizing high-quality Text-to-VectorSQL training data.

<title>Distillation versus Contrastive Learning: How to Train Your Rerankers</title>

Abstract: Training effective text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a larger reranker). While both have been studied extensively, a clear comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of different sizes (0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B) and architectures (Transformer, Recurrent) using both methods on the same data, with a strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling from a more performant teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy based on available teacher models. We recommend using knowledge distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more performant teacher is accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning remains a robust baseline. Our code implementation is made available to facilitate reproducbility.

Abstract: We propose XL-DURel, a finetuned, multilingual Sentence Transformer model optimized for ordinal Word-in-Context classification. We test several loss functions for regression and ranking tasks managing to outperform previous models on ordinal and binary data with a ranking objective based on angular distance in complex space. We further show that binary WiC can be treated as a special case of ordinal WiC and that optimizing models for the general ordinal task improves performance on the more specific binary task. This paves the way for a unified treatment of WiC modeling across different task formulations.

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law, aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought (CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

<title>Balancing Quality and Variation: Spam Filtering Distorts Data Label Distributions</title>

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal (<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are more random than real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give relatively fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that account for label diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

Abstract: The paper presents an overview of the fourth edition of the Shared Task on Multilingual Coreference Resolution, organized as part of the CODI-CRAC 2025 workshop. As in the previous editions, participants were challenged to develop systems that identify mentions and cluster them according to identity coreference.
  A key innovation of this year's task was the introduction of a dedicated Large Language Model (LLM) track, featuring a simplified plaintext format designed to be more suitable for LLMs than the original CoNLL-U representation.
  The task also expanded its coverage with three new datasets in two additional languages, using version 1.3 of CorefUD - a harmonized multilingual collection of 22 datasets in 17 languages.
  In total, nine systems participated, including four LLM-based approaches (two fine-tuned and two using few-shot adaptation). While traditional systems still kept the lead, LLMs showed clear potential, suggesting they may soon challenge established approaches in future editions.

<title>Training Large Language Models To Reason In Parallel With Global Forking Tokens</title>

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree. Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy. Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that, while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT), preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi, arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology is by no means complete or exact. It was nonetheless able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close about a third of the sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences, 2025].

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) are emerging as a compelling alternative to Transformers because of their consistent memory usage and high performance. Despite this, scaling up SSMs on cloud services or limited-resource devices is challenging due to their storage requirements and computational power. To overcome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model size and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to quantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a particular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance. However, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different scenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for enhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To this end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both Mamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment on various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation persistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a linear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined with a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$. To ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline according to the clustering sequence. The experiments show that Quamba2-8B outperforms two state-of-the-art SSM quantization methods and delivers 1.3$\times$ and 3$\times$ speed-ups in the pre-filling and generation stages, respectively, while offering 4$\times$ memory reduction with only a $1.6\%$ average accuracy drop. The evaluation on MMLU shows the generalizability and robustness of our framework. The code and quantized models will be released at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Quamba.

<title>RadZero: Similarity-Based Cross-Attention for Explainable Vision-Language Alignment in Chest X-ray with Zero-Shot Multi-Task Capability</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal models have significantly improved vision-language (VL) alignment in radiology. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{RadZero}$, a novel framework for VL alignment in chest X-ray with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is $\textbf{VL-CABS}$ ($\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{A}$ttention $\textbf{B}$ased on $\textbf{S}$imilarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) are attracting increasing interest in healthcare. This commentary evaluates the potential of LLMs to improve clinical prediction models (CPMs) for diagnostic and prognostic tasks, with a focus on their ability to process longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data.
  Findings: LLMs show promise in handling multimodal and longitudinal EHR data and can support multi-outcome predictions for diverse health conditions. However, methodological, validation, infrastructural, and regulatory chal- lenges remain. These include inadequate methods for time-to-event modelling, poor calibration of predictions, limited external validation, and bias affecting underrepresented groups. High infrastructure costs and the absence of clear regulatory frameworks further prevent adoption.
  Implications: Further work and interdisciplinary collaboration are needed to support equitable and effective integra- tion into the clinical prediction. Developing temporally aware, fair, and explainable models should be a priority focus for transforming clinical prediction workflow.

<title>Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence Curation for Open-Domain Financial Question Answering on Standardized Documents</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based large language models (LLMs) are widely used in finance for their excellent performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, standardized documents (e.g., SEC filing) share similar formats such as repetitive boilerplate texts, and similar table structures. This similarity forces traditional RAG methods to misidentify near-duplicate text, leading to duplicate retrieval that undermines accuracy and completeness. To address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence Curation (HiREC) framework. Our approach first performs hierarchical retrieval to reduce confusion among similar texts. It first retrieve related documents and then selects the most relevant passages from the documents. The evidence curation process removes irrelevant passages. When necessary, it automatically generates complementary queries to collect missing information. To evaluate our approach, we construct and release a Large-scale Open-domain Financial (LOFin) question answering benchmark that includes 145,897 SEC documents and 1,595 question-answer pairs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/deep-over/LOFin-bench-HiREC.

arXiv:2506.22666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.

arXiv:2509.16189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When do machine learning systems fail to generalize, and what mechanisms could improve their generalization? Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive science to argue that one weakness of parametric machine learning systems is their failure to exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not relevant to the task at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We show how this perspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling to new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive science points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these issues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval mechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better across many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential components for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of within-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information across retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible contributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning systems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval methods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization. We close by discussing some of the links between these findings and prior results in cognitive science and neuroscience, and the broader implications.

Summary:<br />
- Large language models often struggle with recursive self-evaluation, resulting in reformulation rather than progress. 
- Study tested this using three models and four task families, finding a decline in mean informational change without external feedback. 
- Grounded runs, with a minimal grounding intervention, showed a rebound in informational change, indicating the importance of external verification. 
- Measures such as n-gram novelty and embedding drift supported the pattern of reflection without contact leading to epistemic stasis. 
- Results suggest a structural limit on self-correction in generative reasoning and highlight the need for grounded, cooperative reasoning designs. <div>
arXiv:2510.21861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning, yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families (arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter. Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Summary: 
The paper introduces ARC, a novel caching framework for Large Language Model-based agents that dynamically manages compact and relevant corpora for each agent. By analyzing historical query distribution patterns and the embedding space of cached items, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance cache. Experimental results on three retrieval datasets show that ARC significantly reduces storage requirements to 0.015% of the original corpus while improving the has-answer rate by up to 79.8% and decreasing average retrieval latency by 80%. This demonstrates that ARC enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered Large Language Model agents.

arXiv:2511.02919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been propelled by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grants the models access to vast external knowledge bases. Despite RAG's success in improving agent performance, agent-level cache management, particularly constructing, maintaining, and updating a compact, relevant corpus dynamically tailored to each agent's need, remains underexplored. Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent RAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent. By synthesizing historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached items in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance cache. With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our experimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to 0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and reducing average retrieval latency by 80%. Our results demonstrate that ARC can drastically enhance efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents.

In the field of machine translation (MT), the reliance on large parallel corpora from the Internet has led to the inclusion of machine-generated translations, impacting translation quality. To address this issue, a new method using internal representations of a multilingual MT model has been proposed to distinguish between human and machine-translated sentences. This approach has shown superior performance compared to existing techniques, especially for non-English language pairs, with an accuracy improvement of at least 5 percentage points. Filtering out non-human translations is crucial for building high-quality MT systems, and this novel method offers a promising solution to enhance translation quality by accurately identifying human-generated translations.1.9292. <div>

Abstract: Modern machine translation (MT) systems depend on large parallel corpora, often collected from the Internet. However, recent evidence indicates that (i) a substantial portion of these texts are machine-generated translations, and (ii) an overreliance on such synthetic content in training data can significantly degrade translation quality. As a result, filtering out non-human translations is becoming an essential pre-processing step in building high-quality MT systems. In this work, we propose a novel approach that directly exploits the internal representations of a surrogate multilingual MT model to distinguish between human and machine-translated sentences. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, particularly for non-English language pairs, achieving gains of at least 5 percentage points of accuracy.

<div> Large Language Models, 3D scene synthesis, fine-grained instructions, LEGO-Eval, LEGO-Bench

Summary:
LEGO-Eval addresses the issue of unrealistic 3D scene generation by introducing a comprehensive evaluation framework that grounds scene components. It outperforms existing methods in assessing alignment between detailed instructions and generated scenes. The LEGO-Bench benchmark highlights limitations in current generation approaches. The importance of realistic scene generation is emphasized to avoid agents learning incorrect priors. Without accurate alignment assessment, embodied agents may struggle in real-world environments. Current evaluation methods like CLIPScore and VLMs fall short due to a shallow understanding of 3D scenes. The experiments show that current approaches struggle to generate scenes aligning with detailed instructions, with success rates not exceeding 10%. Advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by fine-grained instructions is crucial for training agents in realistic environments. <div>
arXiv:2511.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions, advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics, degrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for effective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment. This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate alignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods. Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.

The article introduces the Analyze-Revise-Finetune (ARF) pipeline, which boosts the performance of smaller open-source language models (LLMs) in customer service summarization tasks. By analyzing errors in summaries generated by a larger model (GPT-3.5), a compact editor model (Llama 3.1 70B) is used to refine the training data, leading to improved summarization by a smaller student model (Llama 3.1 8B). The ARF pipeline enhances cost efficiency and data privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce an Analyze-Revise-Finetune (ARF) pipeline that enables smaller open-source language models (LLMs) to surpass substantially larger proprietary models in customer service summarization tasks. The pipeline first analyzes and categorizes common errors in summaries produced by a teacher model (GPT-3.5), then performs a targeted revision using a compact editor model (Llama 3.1 70B) to generate high-quality, refined training data. Fine-tuning a smaller student model (Llama 3.1 8B) on this refined data resulted in superior summarization performance compared to GPT-3.5. The ARF pipeline improves cost efficiency and data privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy, illustrating a generalizable framework for enhancing open-source LLMs across diverse downstream applications.

<div> Evaluation Method, Decoder-only Generative Models, Fine-tuning, Multitask Learning, Education Review

Summary: 
1) A novel evaluation method, FTS-OBP, is proposed to address the rigidity of traditional evaluation methods for ABSA tasks, allowing for realistic boundary variations and providing fine-grained diagnostics.
2) Small decoder-only generative language models are studied for ABSA, exploring resource lower bounds in education review ABSA. Data-free and data-light fine-tuning methods are examined, with a multitask fine-tuning strategy significantly improving performance of smaller models.
3) The first public set of education review ABSA resources is released to support research in low-resource domains. <div>
arXiv:2511.03034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained opinion mining approach that identifies and classifies opinions associated with specific entities (aspects) or their categories within a sentence. Despite its rapid growth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in commercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet low-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation challenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive in-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas. Moreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly rigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent the performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through three contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text Similarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates realistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation with traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present the first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs; <7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education review ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask fine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling 1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first public set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in low-resource domains.

<div> Keywords: Conversational AI, one-sided conversation problem, reconstruction, summarization, privacy-aware conversational AI

Summary: 
Conversational AI often faces limitations in real-world scenarios where only one side of a dialogue can be recorded, such as in telemedicine or call centers. The one-sided conversation problem (1SC) is formalized to address this challenge. Two tasks are focused on: reconstructing missing speaker turns in real-time scenarios and generating summaries from one-sided transcripts. Through evaluations on various datasets using different models and metrics, it was found that access to future turns and information on utterance length enhances the reconstruction process. Placeholder prompting helps reduce hallucinations, especially for smaller models that require fine-tuning. Moreover, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing turns. This study presents promising results that signify progress towards privacy-aware conversational AI solutions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Conversational AI is constrained in many real-world settings where only one side of a dialogue can be recorded, such as telemedicine, call centers, and smart glasses. We formalize this as the one-sided conversation problem (1SC): inferring and learning from one side of a conversation. We study two tasks: (1) reconstructing the missing speaker's turns for real-time use cases, and (2) generating summaries from one-sided transcripts. Evaluating prompting and finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and information about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder prompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate promising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning. Further, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing turns. We present 1SC as a novel challenge and report promising results that mark a step toward privacy-aware conversational AI.

Abstract: Text Normalization (TN) is a key preprocessing step in Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, converting written forms into their canonical spoken equivalents. Traditional TN systems can exhibit high accuracy, but involve substantial engineering effort, are difficult to scale, and pose challenges to language coverage, particularly in low-resource settings. We propose PolyNorm, a prompt-based approach to TN using Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to reduce the reliance on manually crafted rules and enable broader linguistic applicability with minimal human intervention. Additionally, we present a language-agnostic pipeline for automatic data curation and evaluation, designed to facilitate scalable experimentation across diverse languages. Experiments across eight languages show consistent reductions in the word error rate (WER) compared to a production-grade-based system. To support further research, we release PolyNorm-Benchmark, a multilingual data set covering a diverse range of text normalization phenomena.

Summary:<br /><br />
This study explores language disruptions in individuals with schizophrenia by analyzing computational linguistic measures such as surprisal and semantic coherence. These disruptions, often seen as disorganized speech and impaired discourse coherence, are potential markers for symptom severity and diagnosis of schizophrenia. By comparing these linguistic measures between subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls, the study aims to understand the differences in language production. Additionally, the research delves into how these measures change with varying levels of schizophrenia symptom severity. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the cognitive disturbances underlying language disruptions in schizophrenia and highlights the use of computational linguistics in objectively assessing these symptoms. <div>

Abstract: Language disruptions are one of the well-known effects of schizophrenia symptoms. They are often manifested as disorganized speech and impaired discourse coherence. These abnormalities in spontaneous language production reflect underlying cognitive disturbances and have the potential to serve as objective markers for symptom severity and diagnosis of schizophrenia. This study focuses on how these language disruptions can be characterized in terms of two computational linguistic measures: surprisal and semantic coherence. By computing surprisal and semantic coherence of language using computational models, this study investigates how they differ between subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Furthermore, this study provides further insight into how language disruptions in terms of these linguistic measures change with varying degrees of schizophrenia symptom severity.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal lexical and semantic differences among users, shedding light on specific mental health conditions. Classification experiments using various models demonstrate the dataset's potential for advancing mental health detection in underrepresented languages like Arabic. This research contributes to addressing the challenges of early detection of mental health disorders in Arabic-speaking populations where resources are limited and stigma hinders discourse. <div>

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect millions worldwide, yet early detection remains a major challenge, particularly for Arabic-speaking populations where resources are limited and mental health discourse is often discouraged due to cultural stigma. While substantial research has focused on English-language mental health detection, Arabic remains significantly underexplored, partly due to the scarcity of annotated datasets. We present CARMA, the first automatically annotated large-scale dataset of Arabic Reddit posts. The dataset encompasses six mental health conditions, such as Anxiety, Autism, and Depression, and a control group. CARMA surpasses existing resources in both scale and diversity. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of lexical and semantic differences between users, providing insights into the linguistic markers of specific mental health conditions. To demonstrate the dataset's potential for further mental health analysis, we perform classification experiments using a range of models, from shallow classifiers to large language models. Our results highlight the promise of advancing mental health detection in underrepresented languages such as Arabic.

Summary:
This paper introduces a control-based framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) using a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure user-desirable text generation. The framework incorporates a safety filter based on the CBF, allowing intervention in the generated text without the need to fine-tune the baseline LLM. The safety filter offers the advantage of being an add-on type, enabling easy integration for alignment purposes. Additionally, if an evaluation model for desired alignment is available, it can be directly applied to the filter design. The text-generation system implemented with open-source language models aims to produce positive text through these control mechanisms. <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure user-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the CBF safety filter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in the generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this safety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes without fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model regarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter design. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source language models, aiming to generate positive text.

Summary:
The article introduces the MME-CC benchmark, a vision-grounded evaluation benchmark for assessing the cognitive capacity of multilingual language models (MLLMs) across spatial, geometric, and knowledge-based reasoning tasks. It aims to address the lack of systematic evaluation of MLLMs' cognitive abilities in existing benchmarks. Results from experiments on 16 MLLMs show that closed-source models currently outperform others, emphasizing the importance of cognitive capacity in evaluation and model design. However, spatial and geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs are still weak, with common error patterns identified such as orientation mistakes and poor adherence to counterfactual instructions. The Chain-of-Thought process in reasoning tasks typically involves three stages— extraction, reasoning, and verification—with heavy reliance on visual information. Overall, the study highlights the need to consider the cognitive capacity of MLLMs in evaluating and improving their performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As reasoning models scale rapidly, the essential role of multimodality in human cognition has come into sharp relief, driving a growing need to probe vision-centric cognitive behaviors. Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either overemphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing vision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs insufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC (Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded benchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three fundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and knowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs' cognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct extensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that closed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs. 30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak (less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns, including orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and poor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that Chain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason -> verify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction. We hope this work catalyzes a shift toward treating the cognitive capacity of MLLMs as central to both evaluation and model design.

Abstract: Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is essential for their responsible deployment. This paper presents a framework for stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict and explain risks. Using the Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method, our framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance goals.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly pervasive, finding applications across many industries and disciplines. Ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs is paramount, where Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a key role. In this work, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted to examine the robustness and effectiveness of diverse UE measures regarding aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in LLMs. It involves twelve different UE methods and four generation quality metrics including LLMScore from LLM criticizers to evaluate the uncertainty of LLM-generated answers in Question-Answering (QA) tasks on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Our analysis reveals that information-based methods, which leverage token and sequence probabilities, perform exceptionally well in ID settings due to their alignment with the model's understanding of the data. Conversely, density-based methods and the P(True) metric exhibit superior performance in OOD contexts, highlighting their effectiveness in capturing the model's epistemic uncertainty. Semantic consistency methods, which assess variability in generated answers, show reliable performance across different datasets and generation metrics. These methods generally perform well but may not be optimal for every situation.

BengaliMoralBench is introduced as the first ethics benchmark for the Bengali language, focusing on five moral domains and 50 culturally relevant subtopics. The benchmark aims to address the lack of cultural alignment in existing ethics benchmarks, particularly for South Asian languages like Bengali. The study evaluates the performance of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek, on the BengaliMoralBench using a unified prompting protocol. Results show varying accuracy levels (50-91%) across models, highlighting weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense reasoning, and moral fairness. The benchmark serves as a foundation for responsible localization and aims to support the deployment of ethically robust AI in diverse, low-resource multilingual settings like Bangladesh.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction across South Asia, their alignment with local ethical norms, particularly for Bengali, which is spoken by over 285 million people and ranked 6th globally, remains underexplored. Existing ethics benchmarks are largely English-centric and shaped by Western frameworks, overlooking cultural nuances critical for real-world deployment. To address this, we introduce BengaliMoralBench, the first large-scale ethics benchmark for the Bengali language and socio-cultural contexts. It covers five moral domains, Daily Activities, Habits, Parenting, Family Relationships, and Religious Activities, subdivided into 50 culturally relevant subtopics. Each scenario is annotated via native-speaker consensus using three ethical lenses: Virtue, Commonsense, and Justice ethics. We conduct systematic zero-shot evaluation of prominent multilingual LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek, using a unified prompting protocol and standard metrics. Performance varies widely (50-91% accuracy), with qualitative analysis revealing consistent weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense reasoning, and moral fairness. BengaliMoralBench provides a foundation for responsible localization, enabling culturally aligned evaluation and supporting the deployment of ethically robust AI in diverse, low-resource multilingual settings such as Bangladesh.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Language Graph Model, meta-relations, Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm, Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Summary:
The Language Graph Model (LGM) aims to enhance conceptual clarity in large language models (LLMs) by extracting meta-relations such as inheritance, alias, and composition from natural language. The model incorporates a reflection mechanism to validate these relationships and dynamically supplies them to the LLM using a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm. This method improves the LLM's ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses without the need for text truncation. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely on extended context windows, the LGM enables LLMs to process texts of any length effectively. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show that the LGM consistently outperforms existing RAG baselines. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong semantic understanding, yet struggle when user instructions involve ambiguous or conceptually misaligned terms. We propose the Language Graph Model (LGM) to enhance conceptual clarity by extracting meta-relations-inheritance, alias, and composition-from natural language. The model further employs a reflection mechanism to validate these meta-relations. Leveraging a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm, these relations and related descriptions are dynamically supplied to the LLM, improving its ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely on extended context windows, our method enables large language models to process texts of any length without the need for truncation. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the LGM consistently outperforms existing RAG baselines.

<div> knowledge graphs, fact-checking, language models, hybrid approach, FEVER benchmark 

Summary:
A new hybrid fact-checking approach is proposed, combining large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs and real-time search agents. The system consists of three steps: Knowledge Graph retrieval, LM-based classification with task-specific prompts, and Web Search Agent utilization. Achieving an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark, the pipeline addresses "Not Enough Information" cases effectively through targeted reannotation studies. The approach uncovers valid evidence for initially labeled NEI claims, validated by expert annotators and LLM reviewers. The system is modular, open-source, with fallback strategies, and generalization across datasets. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating fluent utterances but can lack reliable grounding in verified information. At the same time, knowledge-graph-based fact-checkers deliver precise and interpretable evidence, yet suffer from limited coverage or latency. By integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs and real-time search agents, we introduce a hybrid fact-checking approach that leverages the individual strengths of each component. Our system comprises three autonomous steps: 1) a Knowledge Graph (KG) Retrieval for rapid one - hop lookups in DBpedia, 2) an LM-based classification guided by a task-specific labeling prompt, producing outputs with internal rule-based logic, and 3) a Web Search Agent invoked only when KG coverage is insufficient. Our pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark on the Supported/Refuted split without task- specific fine - tuning. To address Not enough information cases, we conduct a targeted reannotation study showing that our approach frequently uncovers valid evidence for claims originally labeled as Not Enough Information (NEI), as confirmed by both expert annotators and LLM reviewers. With this paper, we present a modular, opensource fact-checking pipeline with fallback strategies and generalization across datasets.

<div> Keywords: Tokenizers, Large Language Models, Multilingual, Indic, Subword

Summary: 
Tokenizers are essential for the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in multilingual settings where scripts and morphology vary. The newly developed IndicSuperTokenizer combines subword and multi-word tokenization with language-specific pre-tokenization, resulting in linguistically aligned tokens and achieving a new state-of-the-art fertility score. Evaluations across English, 22 Indian languages, and code data show a significant improvement in the average fertility score compared to existing models. The tokenizer enhances inference throughput by 44% over previous models while maintaining performance on benchmark tests. Ablations conducted on training data size, vocabulary size, merging techniques, and pre-tokenization strategies demonstrate the robustness of the design choices, highlighting the effectiveness of the IndicSuperTokenizer in enhancing the efficiency and performance of multilingual LLMs.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Tokenizers play a crucial role in determining the performance, training efficiency, and the inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs). Designing effective tokenizers for multilingual LLMs is particularly challenging due to diverse scripts and rich morphological variation. While subword methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely adopted, their effectiveness in multilingual settings remains underexplored. We present IndicSuperTokenizer, a tokenizer for Indic multilingual LLMs, that combines both subword and multi-word tokenization, along with language-specific pre-tokenization, leading to more linguistically aligned tokens and achieving a new state-of-the-art in fertility score. Evaluated across English, 22 Indian languages and code data, our tokenizer improves the average fertility score by 39.5% over LLaMA4 and by 18% over Sutra (the current best). This translates to 44% improvement in inference throughput over LLaMA4 while maintaining comparable performance on English and Indic benchmarks. We also present detailed ablations across tokenizer training data size, vocabulary size, merging techniques, and pre-tokenization strategies, demonstrating the robustness of our design choices.

Summary: 
The study compares the performance of four open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside OpenAI's GPT-3.5 in question-answering tasks within the computer science literature using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) support. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision for binary questions, ranking by human expert and Google's AI model Gemini, and cosine similarity for long-answer questions were utilized. GPT-3.5 demonstrated strong performance in binary and long-answer question answering when paired with RAG. Mistral-7b-instruct outperformed other open-source LLMs in both binary and long-answer question tasks. Orca-mini-v3-7b reported the shortest response latency, while LLaMa2-7b-chat exhibited the highest latency in generating responses. The research suggests that open-source LLMs can complement proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with improved infrastructure. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a powerful technique to enhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by reducing hallucination. Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat, Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini, alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.

<div> SCALE, continual pre-training, large language models, width upscaling architecture, preservation, adaptation

Summary:
Continual pre-training for large language models benefits more from scaling the right structure than scaling parameters alone. SCALE, a width upscaling architecture, enhances model capacity by inserting lightweight expansion into linear modules while maintaining the original model's functionality. Guided by Persistent Preservation and Collaborative Adaptation principles, SCALE variants like SCALE-Preserve, SCALE-Adapt, and SCALE-Route balance preservation of pre-trained weights with adaptation for acquiring new knowledge. This approach mitigates forgetting and achieves stability-plasticity trade-offs in continual pre-training experiments on Korean and English corpora. Analysis confirms preservation's reliability and highlights the optimization benefits of the interplay between preservation and adaptation in improving model performance. <div>
arXiv:2511.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that progress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling parameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that inserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all pre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies and increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original functionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation, which maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented initialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative Adaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to acquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as SCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and SCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing between preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography benchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion while still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean corpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and competitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best overall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when preservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and adaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning setups.

<div> Keywords: speech-to-text translation, automatic evaluation, neural metrics, source-aware metrics, cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm

Summary:<br />
- The study explores source-aware metrics for speech-to-text translation, focusing on real-world scenarios without source transcripts.
- Two strategies are analyzed for generating synthetic sources: automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts and back-translations of reference translations.
- A novel cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm addresses alignment issues between synthetic sources and references.
- ASR transcripts are found to be a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when the word error rate is below 20%.
- The cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables the robust use of source-aware machine translation metrics in speech translation evaluation.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically performed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference translations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the limitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from the source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that neural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with human judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the source is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments between source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular focus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not available. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual proxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and back-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch between synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried out on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with diverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts constitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word error rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a computationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT metrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled evaluation methodologies for speech translation.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, reasoning MLLMs, clinical tasks, model performance, medical applications

Summary: 
This study examines the impact of "thinking mode" capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in clinical tasks. Two leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, were evaluated on visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. The study found that the activation of the thinking mode did not significantly improve performance compared to the standard non-thinking mode for most tasks. In particular, the models' performance on complex medical tasks like open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation was suboptimal, indicating the need for domain-specific medical data and advanced methods for medical knowledge integration. This research highlights the challenges in applying reasoning MLLMs to medical applications and the importance of developing specialized approaches for accurate and reliable clinical task performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode") alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these "dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has become a transformative approach in bioinformatics that often enables advancements in genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, and drug discovery. To systematically identify and evaluate these growing developments, this review proposed six research questions (RQs), according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The objective is to evaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive performance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for advanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological analysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics subfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling), which demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern recognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model architectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to targeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant benefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data integration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis. RQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and synthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests the main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that impact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust evaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular datasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as CELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly support the training and generalization of GenAI models.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges in evaluating the fairness of large language models (LLMs) in sensitive applications. Current methods often overlook biases encoded within models' latent space, leading to a false sense of fairness. The concept of silenced biases is introduced, which are unfair preferences hidden by safety alignment. The Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB) is proposed to uncover these biases by reducing model refusals during question-answer evaluations. SBB can easily be expanded to new demographic groups and subjects, providing a framework for evaluating fairness beyond alignment training. The approach is demonstrated on multiple LLMs, revealing a significant disparity between models' direct responses and underlying fairness issues. <div>

Abstract: Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread, especially in sensitive applications where fairness is essential and biased outputs can cause significant harm. However, evaluating the fairness of models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize standard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook deeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive fairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work, we introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences encoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by safety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases often relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which present limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with additional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to uncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals during QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects, presenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future development of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment training. We demonstrate our approach over multiple LLMs, where our findings expose an alarming distinction between models' direct responses and their underlying fairness issues.

<div> emotionally charged complex personas, credit negotiation, small language models, strategic intelligence, privacy-preserving

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a framework that enhances the performance of small language models (SLMs) in emotionally charged credit negotiation scenarios through emotional personas. EQ-Negotiator integrates game theory and a Hidden Markov Model to track debtor emotional states in real-time, enabling SLMs to counter manipulation and de-escalate conflicts ethically. Agent-to-agent simulations demonstrate that a 7B parameter SLM with EQ-Negotiator outperforms larger LLMs in debt recovery and negotiation efficiency by more than 10 times. This work emphasizes the importance of strategic emotional intelligence over raw model scale in automated negotiation. Additionally, it highlights the shift from descriptive character profiles to dynamic emotional architectures for persona modeling within privacy constraints. EQ-Negotiator enables the development of effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators suitable for on-device applications. 

<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative, they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints. Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation, paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators that can operate on the edge.

Summary:
Logical data augmentation is a critical task that can be both costly and challenging when relying heavily on human annotation. This article introduces a novel approach called LFC-DA, which utilizes symbolic logic to control the generation of logical text. The pipeline of LFC-DA involves mapping text to propositional expressions, compiling a compact rule library, and conducting a bounded state-space search to generate valid formulas. These formulas are then transformed back into natural-language questions to ensure diversity and logical rigor under propositional logic. Experiments conducted on datasets like ReClor and LogiQA demonstrate significant improvements in logical-reasoning accuracy when using LFC-DA with pretrained models. Overall, LFC-DA presents an effective solution for logically heterogeneous data generation guided by large language models.

Abstract: For complex logical data augmentation, heavy reliance on human annotation is costly, whereas direct generation with large language models yields uninterpretable and logically homogeneous examples. To address this, we present LFC-DA, a symbolic-logic-controlled pipeline: logical text is first mapped to propositional expressions, a compact rule library is compiled, and a bounded state-space search systematically discovers valid formulas that are then verbalized back into natural-language questions, ensuring both diversity and logical rigor under propositional logic. Experiments on ReClor and LogiQA show significant improvements in the logical-reasoning accuracy of pretrained models, confirming the effectiveness of LFC-DA for LLM-guided logical data augmentation.

<div> Machine Translation, Tokenization, Byte Pair Encoding, Asymmetric BPE, Low-resource Settings

Summary:
Asymmetric Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for word segmentation in Machine Translation (MT) systems has been shown to significantly improve performance, especially in low-resource settings. By using different numbers of merge operations (NMOs) for the source and target languages, optimal results are achieved. In experiments across various language pairs and data sizes, high NMOs for the source language and low NMOs for the target language prove to be beneficial. Specifically, English-Hindi MT systems saw average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ in low-resource setups. This trend was consistent across additional language pairs, with statistically significant improvements in 10 out of 12 systems compared to symmetric BPE. These findings emphasize the importance of considering asymmetric BPE segmentation recipes for improving MT system performance, particularly in low-resource scenarios.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Machine Translation (MT) research often suggests a single, fixed set of hyperparameters for word segmentation models, symmetric Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which applies the same number of merge operations (NMO) to train tokenizers for both source and target languages. However, we demonstrate that this uniform approach doesn't guarantee optimal MT performance across different language pairs and data sizes. This work investigates BPE segmentation recipes across various data volumes and language pairs to evaluate MT system performance. We find that utilizing asymmetric BPE, where the source and target languages have different NMOs, significantly improves results over the symmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K, 100K, and 500K sentence pairs). Specifically, asymmetric BPE yield statistically significant ($p<0.05$) average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in low-resource setups. We validated this trend across six additional language pairs (English and Telugu, Shona, Norwegian, Kyrgyz, Hausa, and Inuktitut), observing statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 12 systems compared to symmetric BPE. Our findings indicate a high NMO for the source (4K to 32K) and a low NMO for the target (0.5K to 2K) provides optimal results, particularly benefiting low-resource MT.

<div> relation extraction, RDF triples, language models, SHACL shapes, synthetic data augmentation<br />
<br />
Small language models (SLMs) have shown potential in relation extraction (RE) for RDF triples using SHACL shapes focusing on common datatype properties. This study delves into the handling of both datatype and object properties by SLMs for comprehensive RDF graph extraction. The main challenge lies in the distribution of rare properties, leading to a bottleneck in performance. To address this, various strategies were evaluated, including stratified sampling, weighted loss, dataset scaling, and template-based synthetic data augmentation. The most effective approach involved constructing a training set with a minimum occurrence threshold for each property. The release of datasets, experimental results, and code ensures reproducibility. These findings provide practical insights for training shape-aware SLMs in semantic RE and point towards promising avenues for future research.

<br /><br />Summary: 
- SLMs show promise in RE for RDF triples using SHACL shapes.
- Handling both datatype and object properties is a key challenge for SLMs.
- The long-tail distribution of rare properties proves to be a bottleneck in performance.
- Various strategies were evaluated to address this issue.
- Constructing a training set with a minimum occurrence threshold for each property was found to be the most effective. <div>

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have shown promises for relation extraction (RE) when extracting RDF triples guided by SHACL shapes focused on common datatype properties. This paper investigates how SLMs handle both datatype and object properties for a complete RDF graph extraction. We show that the key bottleneck is related to long-tail distribution of rare properties. To solve this issue, we evaluate several strategies: stratified sampling, weighted loss, dataset scaling, and template-based synthetic data augmentation. We show that the best strategy to perform equally well over unbalanced target properties is to build a training set where the number of occurrences of each property exceeds a given threshold. To enable reproducibility, we publicly released our datasets, experimental results and code. Our findings offer practical guidance for training shape-aware SLMs and highlight promising directions for future work in semantic RE.

<div> Keywords: large language models, Chain-of-Thought prompting, efficient reasoning, hybrid model, implicit reasoning

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called 3TF for efficient reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that compress verbose reasoning outputs, 3TF takes a Short-to-Long perspective by training a hybrid model capable of operating in both reasoning and non-reasoning modes. The model is further trained on CoT-annotated data to internalize structured reasoning while enforcing concise, thought-free outputs during inference. This approach improves the quality of reasoning in non-reasoning outputs, allowing models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while producing short external outputs. Empirical results show significant improvements in reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference, suggesting that high-quality reasoning can be learned and executed implicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.

<br /><br />Summary: The article presents the 3TF framework for efficient reasoning in large language models, focusing on implicit reasoning through a hybrid model trained on CoT-annotated data. This approach enhances the quality of reasoning in non-reasoning outputs, enabling models to perform rich internal reasoning while producing concise thought-free external outputs. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference, highlighting the potential for implicit reasoning without explicit step-by-step generation. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have leveraged explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to improve reasoning accuracy. However, most existing methods primarily compress verbose reasoning outputs. These Long-to-Short transformations aim to improve efficiency, but still rely on explicit reasoning during inference. In this work, we introduce \textbf{3TF} (\textbf{T}hought-\textbf{T}raining and \textbf{T}hought-\textbf{F}ree inference), a framework for efficient reasoning that takes a Short-to-Long perspective. We first train a hybrid model that can operate in both reasoning and non-reasoning modes, and then further train it on CoT-annotated data to internalize structured reasoning, while enforcing concise, thought-free outputs at inference time using the no-reasoning mode. Unlike compression-based approaches, 3TF improves the reasoning quality of non-reasoning outputs, enabling models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while keeping external outputs short. Empirically, 3TF-trained models obtain large improvements on reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference, demonstrating that high quality reasoning can be learned and executed implicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.

<div> Keywords: QuestionRAG, question-answering systems, large language models, input errors, reinforcement learning

Summary:<br /><br />Input errors in question-answering systems often result in incorrect responses. Large language models (LLMs) commonly struggle with interpreting user intent or making unnecessary alterations to the original question. The proposed QuestionRAG framework addresses these challenges by enriching input with external knowledge to combat misinterpretation and using reinforcement learning (RL) to align the model's objective with precise correction, rather than just paraphrasing. The results demonstrate the importance of knowledge augmentation for understanding faulty questions, and RL-based alignment proves to be more effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in enhancing the model's ability to follow instructions and generalize. By combining these approaches, QuestionRAG unleashes the full capabilities of LLMs for question correction tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Input errors in question-answering (QA) systems often lead to incorrect responses. Large language models (LLMs) struggle with this task, frequently failing to interpret user intent (misinterpretation) or unnecessarily altering the original question's structure (over-correction). We propose QuestionRAG, a framework that tackles these problems. To address misinterpretation, it enriches the input with external knowledge (e.g., search results, related entities). To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to align the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing. Our results demonstrate that knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding faulty questions. Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's ability to follow instructions and generalize. By integrating these two strategies, QuestionRAG unlocks the full potential of LLMs for the question correction task.

Summary: 
CareMedEval introduces a new dataset for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in biomedical critical appraisal and reasoning tasks. The dataset is derived from exams taken by French medical students, containing 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Benchmarking different LLMs shows that both generalist and biomedical-specialized models struggle to achieve high accuracy, particularly in questions related to study limitations and statistical analysis. While incorporating intermediate reasoning tokens can improve results, the overall challenge of the task remains evident. CareMedEval serves as a challenging benchmark for evaluating LLMs in grounded reasoning tasks, highlighting current limitations and pointing towards future developments in automated support for critical appraisal.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Critical appraisal of scientific literature is an essential skill in the biomedical field. While large language models (LLMs) can offer promising support in this task, their reliability remains limited, particularly for critical reasoning in specialized domains. We introduce CareMedEval, an original dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal and reasoning tasks. Derived from authentic exams taken by French medical students, the dataset contains 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Unlike existing benchmarks, CareMedEval explicitly evaluates critical reading and reasoning grounded in scientific papers. Benchmarking state-of-the-art generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions reveals the difficulty of the task: open and commercial models fail to exceed an Exact Match Rate of 0.5 even though generating intermediate reasoning tokens considerably improves the results. Yet, models remain challenged especially on questions about study limitations and statistical analysis. CareMedEval provides a challenging benchmark for grounded reasoning, exposing current LLM limitations and paving the way for future development of automated support for critical appraisal.

Summary: 
Kastor is a framework introduced in this article to enhance RDF pattern-based extraction for fine-tuning small language models. It focuses on a specified SHACL shape, enabling efficient training on limited text and RDF data. Kastor shifts the traditional validation task from single SHACL shape validation to evaluating all possible combinations of properties derived from the shape, improving model generalization and performance by selecting the optimal combination for each example. The framework also utilizes an iterative learning process to refine noisy knowledge bases, creating robust models capable of uncovering new, relevant facts in specialized domains. Kastor addresses the demands for completing and refining knowledge bases by advancing the extraction approach and improving overall model capabilities.

Summary: <br />
Large language models are effective for technical problem solving in English but struggle in Bangla. Existing translation systems often mistranslate technical terms, leading to wrong answers. The BanglaSTEM dataset, comprising 5,000 Bangla-English sentence pairs from STEM fields, addresses this issue. Through careful selection and human evaluation, the dataset ensures accurate preservation of technical terminology. A T5-based translation model trained on BanglaSTEM demonstrates improved accuracy in translating technical content, benefiting Bangla speakers utilizing English-focused language models for tasks such as code generation and math problem solving. The dataset and trained model are publicly available for use. <div>

Abstract: Large language models work well for technical problem solving in English but perform poorly when the same questions are asked in Bangla. A simple solution would be to translate Bangla questions into English first and then use these models. However, existing Bangla-English translation systems struggle with technical terms. They often mistranslate specialized vocabulary, which changes the meaning of the problem and leads to wrong answers. We present BanglaSTEM, a dataset of 5,000 carefully selected Bangla-English sentence pairs from STEM fields including computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. We generated over 12,000 translations using language models and then used human evaluators to select the highest quality pairs that preserve technical terminology correctly. We train a T5-based translation model on BanglaSTEM and test it on two tasks: generating code and solving math problems. Our results show significant improvements in translation accuracy for technical content, making it easier for Bangla speakers to use English-focused language models effectively. Both the BanglaSTEM dataset and the trained translation model are publicly released at https://huggingface.co/reyazul/BanglaSTEM-T5.

<div> memory systems, AI, hallucinations, evaluation, benchmark

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Hallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem) to evaluate memory systems at different operational stages. It addresses memory hallucinations in AI systems by defining three evaluation tasks: memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question answering. Two datasets, HaluMem-Medium and HaluMem-Long, are constructed for human-AI interaction with extensive memory points and multi-type questions. The empirical studies reveal that memory systems tend to generate hallucinations during extraction and updating stages, leading to errors in question answering. The research highlights the importance of developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms to enhance memory reliability. Future focus should be on suppressing hallucinations systematically to improve overall system performance. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory systems are key components that enable AI systems such as LLMs and AI agents to achieve long-term learning and sustained interaction. However, during memory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory hallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions. Existing evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question answering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within the memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the Hallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines three evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question answering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different operational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct user-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and HaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type questions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns, with context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations across different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based on HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate hallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently propagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus on developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that systematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.

<div> Keywords: large language models, instruction-following ability, dialogue, benchmark, EvolIF 

Summary: 
Large language models' ability to follow user instructions in multi-turn dialogues is crucial for conversational applications. Existing benchmarks are limited in assessing user experience. A new framework decouples linguistic forms from user intent simulation, tracking constraints, instructions, and topics for a more realistic assessment. The framework allows for dynamic benchmark construction, simulating user patience for realistic interaction assessment. The EvolIF benchmark, incorporating nine constraint types, showed GPT-5's superior instruction-following performance with an average of 18.54 turns and 70.31% robustness, outperforming other models significantly. Data and code will be publicly available. This framework provides a more comprehensive evaluation of language models' ability to understand and follow user instructions across varied topics and constraints. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how well large language models can follow users' instructions throughout a dialogue spanning multiple topics is of great importance for data-intensive conversational applications. Existing benchmarks are often limited to a fixed number of turns, making them susceptible to saturation and failing to account for the user's interactive experience. In this work, we propose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following ability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from user intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints, instructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by enabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and tracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated user's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the interaction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving instruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types. Our results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following performance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and demonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant margin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind. All of the data and code will be made publicly available online.

Summary:
stack-augmented neural networks are demonstrated to generalize in a human-like fashion without syntactic supervision, pre-training, or extended training. Three base architectures (transformer, simple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two types of stacks are tested. Transformers with nondeterministic stacks exhibit superior generalization on a question formation task. A modification to the stack RNN architecture enhances hierarchical generalization. These findings suggest that stack-augmented neural networks may offer more accurate models of human language acquisition compared to standard architectures, making them valuable subjects for psycholinguistic research. The study's code is publicly available. <div>
arXiv:2511.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any finite set of training data is consistent with an infinite number of hypothetical algorithms that could have generated it. Studies have shown that when human children learn language, they consistently favor hypotheses based on hierarchical syntactic rules without ever encountering disambiguating examples. A recent line of work has inquired as to whether common neural network architectures share this bias, finding that they do so only under special conditions: when syntactically supervised, when pre-trained on massive corpora, or when trained long past convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in human-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements: stack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer, simple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack of Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed by DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic stacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question formation task. We also propose a modification to the stack RNN architecture that improves hierarchical generalization. These results suggest that stack-augmented neural networks may be more accurate models of human language acquisition than standard architectures, serving as useful objects of psycholinguistic study. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Measuring the full abilities of large language models (LLMs) requires benchmarks representing multiple tasks. We aim to create large, high-quality datasets for comparison of logical reasoning skills across several languages and of suitable difficulty for LLMs of various reasoning ability. We explore multiple ways of increasing difficulty. We generate zebra puzzles in multiple languages, themes, sizes and including 14 different clue types and 8 red herring types (uninformative clues). We find puzzle sizes 2x3 and 4x5 are sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini (a non-reasoning model) and o3-mini (a reasoning model), respectively. Including 5 red herrings decreases o3-mini puzzle-level accuracy on 4x5 puzzles by 15$\pm$7 %. Scores of o3-mini on 4x5 puzzles are not significantly affected by use of English vs. Danish or the common houses theme vs. the country-specific smoerrebroed theme. We find no correlation between difficulty and the selected clue types. Datasets of 128+1024 puzzles are published as MultiZebraLogic in each of nine Germanic languages for sizes 2x3 and 4x5. We publish code for puzzle generation, designed for adaptablity into more languages and themes.

<div> locality, transformer language models, interpretation, distributed representations, control<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel approach to transformer language models that allows for controllable locality, enabling a balance between interpretability and performance. By tuning a locality parameter, the model can dynamically adjust between localist encodings and distributed representations without requiring retraining. Experimental results on the WikiText corpus show that highly localist configurations result in lower attention entropy and higher pointer fidelity scores. Intermediate locality values optimize the tradeoff between interpretability and performance, with a specific value achieving a test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. This demonstrates that localist language models offer a practical framework for applications in regulated domains, providing precise control over the interpretability-performance spectrum through penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design principles.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical demonstration of controllable locality in transformer language models, a novel architectural framework that enables continuous control over the degree of representation localization through a tunable locality dial parameter. Unlike traditional language models that rely exclusively on distributed representations, our approach allows dynamic interpolation between highly interpretable localist encodings and efficient distributed representations without requiring model retraining. We conducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer architecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\lambda} across the full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed). Our results demonstrate that localist configurations achieve dramatically lower attention entropy, with {\lambda} = 1.0 yielding 5.36 bits compared to 7.18 bits at {\lambda} = 0.0, while maintaining substantially higher pointer fidelity scores reflecting stronger alignment with rule-specified targets. Prediction experiments reveal that intermediate locality values optimize the tradeoff between interpretability and performance, with {\lambda} = 0.6 achieving test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. These findings establish that localist language models provide a practical framework for applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability, offering precise mathematical control over the interpretability-performance spectrum through explicit penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design principles.

Summary:
Step-Audio-EditX is introduced as a novel open-source audio model utilizing large-margin learning for expressive and iterative audio editing. It excels in emotion editing, speaking style variations, and other fine-grained control tasks while also supporting robust zero-shot text-to-speech capabilities. Unlike prior models, Step-Audio-EditX does not rely on embedding-based priors or auxiliary modules, instead focusing on large-margin synthetic data for training. This approach enables iterative control and high expressivity across voices without the need for disentanglement at the representation level.

Abstract: We present Step-Audio-EditX, the first open-source LLM-based audio model excelling at expressive and iterative audio editing encompassing emotion, speaking style, and paralinguistics alongside robust zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities.Our core innovation lies in leveraging only large-margin synthetic data, which circumvents the need for embedding-based priors or auxiliary modules. This large-margin learning approach enables both iterative control and high expressivity across voices, and represents a fundamental pivot from the conventional focus on representation-level disentanglement. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio-EditX surpasses both MiniMax-2.6-hd and Doubao-Seed-TTS-2.0 in emotion editing and other fine-grained control tasks.

<div> framework, interpretable, stance detection, large language models, implicit rationales <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new interpretable Zero-Shot Stance Detection framework called IRIS. It addresses issues with existing methods by providing implicit and explicit rationales for stance detection. IRIS considers stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, using implicit rationales within the text and explicit communicative features to guide predictions. The model does not require ground-truth rationales, ensuring interpretability. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the generalizability of IRIS even with limited training data. The model's architecture and interpretable design offer a nuanced understanding of the author's attitude towards different targets. <div>
arXiv:2511.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward unseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data augmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between text and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD focus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating explanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by their over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that lack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it difficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our study, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an interpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target implicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and explicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the relevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model towards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales, thus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales based on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive dimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's attitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10% training data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the proposed architecture and interpretable design.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, conspiracy beliefs, sociodemographic biases, conditioning, misinformation

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) were examined for conspiratorial tendencies and sociodemographic biases. The study assessed whether these models could be conditioned into adopting conspiracy beliefs and found that LLMs exhibited partial agreement with such beliefs. Conditioning LLMs with socio-demographic attributes revealed uneven effects, exposing latent biases in the models. The study also discovered that targeted prompts could easily influence LLM responses towards conspiratorial directions, highlighting the susceptibility of these models to manipulation. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluating psychological dimensions embedded in LLMs to advance computational social science and mitigate potential risks associated with the deployment of these models in sensitive contexts. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit conspiratorial tendencies, whether they display sociodemographic biases in this domain, and how easily they can be conditioned into adopting conspiratorial perspectives. Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of misinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a critical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are increasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known about whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a conspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated psychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under different prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs show partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning with socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent demographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses toward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs to manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive contexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the psychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social science and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses.

<div> Keywords: collaborative dialogue, common ground, perspectivist annotation, reference expressions, understanding states

Summary:
Collaborative dialogue relies on establishing common ground among participants, but in asymmetric settings, misunderstandings can arise where individuals believe they agree while referring to different entities. This study introduces a perspectivist annotation scheme for the HCRC MapTask corpus, allowing for separate capture of speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression. By analyzing 13,000 annotated reference expressions, it was found that full misunderstandings are rare once lexical variants are unified. However, multiplicity discrepancies systematically lead to divergences, highlighting how apparent grounding can conceal referential misalignment. This framework serves as a valuable resource for studying grounded misunderstandings and evaluating the ability of (variational) language models to accurately model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative dialogue. 

<br /><br />Summary: Collaborative dialogue in asymmetric settings can lead to misunderstandings despite participants believing they agree, due to referring to different entities. A perspectivist annotation scheme for the HCRC MapTask corpus helps capture speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for reference expressions, revealing that full misunderstandings are scarce after unifying lexical variants. However, multiplicity discrepancies systematically cause divergences, demonstrating how apparent grounding can hide referential misalignment. This framework is crucial for studying grounded misunderstandings and assessing the capability of language models to capture perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative dialogue. <div>
arXiv:2511.03718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing common ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while referring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme for the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression, enabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over time. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the resulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask referential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating (V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative dialogue.

Summary:  
Efforts are being made to identify how specific datasets are used in scientific literature, utilizing transformer-based large language models as a scalable approach to describing data use cases. Applying the open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, structured data use case labels for publications incorporating genomic datasets were generated. A novel evaluation framework was introduced to assess the effectiveness of the methods, achieving an F1 score of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task without pre-defined categories. However, barriers such as data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure, and the expense of responsible performance evaluation hinder the full potential of these methods. <div>

Abstract: Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure, and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.

<div> Transformer-based language models, General Relativity, geometry, attention mechanism, token embeddings <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article presents a geometric framework that draws an analogy between Transformer-based language models and General Relativity. It suggests that queries and keys induce an effective metric on representation space, with attention acting as a discrete connection for parallel transport of value vectors across tokens. Stacked layers in the model provide discrete time-slices through which token representations evolve on a curved manifold, influenced by backpropagation acting as a shaping principle in parameter space. Experiments designed to test this analogy reveal a curvature landscape for a paragraph, showing how token embeddings follow curved trajectories in feature space. Simulations demonstrate excess counts of sharp/flat angles and longer length-to-chord ratios, confirming the presence of curvature not explainable by chance. Controlled context edits reveal measurable bends in embedding trajectories, confirming attention-induced curvature in the model. <div>

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for understanding Transformer-based language models, drawing an explicit analogy to General Relativity. Queries and keys induce an effective metric on representation space, and attention acts as a discrete connection that implements parallel transport of value vectors across tokens. Stacked layers provide discrete time-slices through which token representations evolve on this curved manifold, while backpropagation plays the role of a least-action principle that shapes loss-minimizing trajectories in parameter space. If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not traverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps should bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature. To test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence and the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a full paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and layers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality or chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe deflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable, meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm attention-induced curvature.

Summary:
This study introduces novel attack frameworks, Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), to generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial examples for Language Model models (LLMs). The goal is to assess the robustness of LLMs against adversarial inputs, particularly for sensitive tasks. The attacks aim to deceive LLMs by generating natural-looking adversarial inputs that maintain semantic similarity to the original text. By leveraging an automated pipeline driven by LLMs, the attacks do not rely on external heuristics. They demonstrate strong transferability across different LLMs and evolve with advancements in LLM technology. This work provides a systematic approach for self-assessment of an LLM's robustness, offering insights into the potential vulnerabilities of these models. The code and data for implementing these attack frameworks are publicly available on GitHub for further research and testing. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: LLMs can provide substantial zero-shot performance on diverse tasks using a simple task prompt, eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning. However, when applying these models to sensitive tasks, it is crucial to thoroughly assess their robustness against adversarial inputs. In this work, we introduce Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two innovative attack frameworks designed to systematically generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial examples by leveraging the understanding of the LLMs. We produce subtle and natural-looking adversarial inputs that preserve semantic similarity to the original text while effectively deceiving the target LLM. By utilizing an automated, LLM-driven pipeline, we eliminate the dependence on external heuristics. Our attacks evolve with the advancements in LLMs and demonstrate strong transferability across models unknown to the attacker. Overall, this work provides a systematic approach for the self-assessment of an LLM's robustness. We release our code and data at https://github.com/Shukti042/AdversarialExample.

Abstract: Empathy is a critical factor in fostering positive user experiences in conversational AI. While models can display empathy, it is often generic rather than tailored to specific tasks and contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for developing and evaluating context-specific empathetic large language models (LLMs). We first analyze a real-world conversational dataset consisting of 672 multi-turn conversations across 8 tasks, revealing significant differences in terms of expected and experienced empathy before and after the conversations, respectively. To help minimize this gap, we develop a synthetic multi-turn conversational generation pipeline and steer responses toward our defined empathy patterns based on the context that more closely matches users' expectations. We then train empathetic expert adapters for context-specific empathy that specialize in varying empathy levels based on the recognized task. Our empirical results demonstrate a significant gap reduction of 72.66% between perceived and desired empathy with scores increasing by an average factor of 2.43 as measured by our metrics and reward models. Additionally, our trained empathetic expert adapters demonstrate superior effectiveness in preserving empathy patterns throughout conversation turns, outperforming system prompts, which tend to dramatically diminish in impact as conversations lengthen.

<title>Let the Bees Find the Weak Spots: A Path Planning Perspective on Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks against LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across various applications, yet their potential security and ethical risks have raised increasing concerns. Existing research employs red teaming evaluations, utilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. However, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue trajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the considerable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these limitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on dynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process as a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a collaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search while substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical evaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates above 90\% across the board, with a peak of 98\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it achieves comparable success with only 26 queries on average, significantly reducing red teaming overhead and highlighting its superior efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the importance of social science knowledge for various stakeholders, measuring its diffusion into different domains remains a challenge. This study uses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social science knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making domains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the measurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories as key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703 documents (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and policy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas in each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare differences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion patterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas diffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding regression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find that the distances between research and policy are typically larger than between research and journalism. We also find that ideas largely shift roles across domains - from being the theories themselves in research to sense-making in news to applied, administrative use in policy. Over time, we observe semantic convergence mainly for ideas that are practically oriented. Our results characterize the cross-domain diffusion patterns and dynamics of social science knowledge at the idea level, and we discuss the implications for measuring knowledge diffusion beyond citations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across benchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but these tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty. Consequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than decision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce LiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in realistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles: (i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on offline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing real-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends control from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk management and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across structurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction markets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each step, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs percentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we run 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1) high LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display distinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and (3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These findings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence, motivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency under live uncertainty.

<title>Watermarking Large Language Models in Europe: Interpreting the AI Act in Light of Technology</title>

Abstract: To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union, the AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their general-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods that are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet, the rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards can be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses this challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the multiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct concepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking Categorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods according to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before, during, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2) Watermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping each criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and detectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since interoperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we propose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking Comparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the operationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all four standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further research into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture of LLMs.

Abstract: Feature generation can significantly enhance learning outcomes, particularly for tasks with limited data. An effective way to improve feature generation is to expand the current feature space using existing features and enriching the informational content. However, generating new, interpretable features usually requires domain-specific knowledge on top of the existing features. In this paper, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Feature Generation method, RAFG, to generate useful and explainable features specific to domain classification tasks. To increase the interpretability of the generated features, we conduct knowledge retrieval among the existing features in the domain to identify potential feature associations. These associations are expected to help generate useful features. Moreover, we develop a framework based on large language models (LLMs) for feature generation with reasoning to verify the quality of the features during their generation process. Experiments across several datasets in medical, economic, and geographic domains show that our RAFG method can produce high-quality, meaningful features and significantly improve classification performance compared with baseline methods.

<title>Do Automatic Factuality Metrics Measure Factuality? A Critical Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to the point that traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, such as ROUGE, have saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduce inaccuracies into summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with or unsupported by the corresponding source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle factual inconsistencies automatically has proved challenging. This in turn has motivated development of metrics intended to measure the factual consistency of generated summaries against sources. But are these approaches measuring what they purport to? Or are they mostly exploiting artifacts? In this work, we stress test a range of automatic factuality metrics, including specialized models and LLM-based prompting methods, to probe what they actually capture. Using a shallow classifier to separate ``easy'' examples for factual evaluation where surface features suffice from ``hard'' cases requiring deeper reasoning, we find that all metrics show substantial performance drops on the latter. Furthermore, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, fact-preserving edits than to factual corrections. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that most automatic factuality metrics can be gamed, i.e., their scores can be artificially inflated by appending innocuous, content-free sentences to summaries. Among the metrics tested, the prompt based ChatGPT-DA approach is the most robust and reliable. However, this comes with a notable caveat: Prompting LLMs to assess factuality may overly rely on their parametric knowledge rather than the provided reference when making judgments. Taken together, our findings call into question the reliability of current factuality metrics and prompt a broader reflection on what these metrics are truly measuring.

Abstract: We present Label Space Reduction (LSR), a novel method for improving zero-shot classification performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). LSR iteratively refines the classification label space by systematically ranking and reducing candidate classes, enabling the model to concentrate on the most relevant options. By leveraging unlabeled data with the statistical learning capabilities of data-driven models, LSR dynamically optimizes the label space representation at test time. Our experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that LSR improves macro-F1 scores by an average of 7.0% (up to 14.2%) with Llama-3.1-70B and 3.3% (up to 11.1%) with Claude-3.5-Sonnet compared to standard zero-shot classification baselines. To reduce the computational overhead of LSR, which requires an additional LLM call at each iteration, we propose distilling the model into a probabilistic classifier, allowing for efficient inference.

Abstract: The use of LLMs as automated judges ("LLM-as-a-judge") is now widespread, yet standard judges suffer from a multitude of reliability issues. To address these challenges, we introduce Verdict, an open-source library for scaling judge-time compute to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of automated evaluators. Verdict leverages the composition of modular reasoning units (such as verification, debate, and aggregation) and increased inference-time compute to improve LLM judge quality. Across a variety of challenging tasks such as content moderation, fact-checking, and hallucination detection, Verdict judges achieves performance competitive with orders-of-magnitude larger fine-tuned judges, prompted judges, and reasoning models. Our framework establishes a foundation for scalable, interpretable, and reliable LLM-based evaluation systems for both researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: The impact of random seeds in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has been largely overlooked despite its potential influence on model performance.In this study, we systematically evaluate the effects of random seeds on LLMs using the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. We analyze the macro-level impact through traditional metrics like accuracy and F1, calculating their mean and variance to quantify performance fluctuations. To capture the micro-level effects, we introduce a novel metric, consistency, measuring the stability of individual predictions across runs. Our experiments reveal significant variance at both macro and micro levels, underscoring the need for careful consideration of random seeds in fine-tuning and evaluation.

<title>Traversal Verification for Speculative Tree Decoding</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a promising approach for accelerating large language models. The primary idea is to use a lightweight draft model to speculate the output of the target model for multiple subsequent timesteps, and then verify them in parallel to determine whether the drafted tokens should be accepted or rejected. To enhance acceptance rates, existing frameworks typically construct token trees containing multiple candidates in each timestep. However, their reliance on token-level verification mechanisms introduces two critical limitations: First, the probability distribution of a sequence differs from that of individual tokens, leading to suboptimal acceptance length. Second, current verification schemes begin from the root node and proceed layer by layer in a top-down manner. Once a parent node is rejected, all its child nodes should be discarded, resulting in inefficient utilization of speculative candidates. This paper introduces Traversal Verification, a novel speculative decoding algorithm that fundamentally rethinks the verification paradigm through leaf-to-root traversal. Our approach considers the acceptance of the entire token sequence from the current node to the root, and preserves potentially valid subsequences that would be prematurely discarded by existing methods. We theoretically prove that the probability distribution obtained through Traversal Verification is identical to that of the target model, guaranteeing lossless inference while achieving substantial acceleration gains. Experimental results across different large language models and multiple tasks show that our method consistently improves acceptance length and throughput over existing methods.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition(NER) for low-resource languages aims to produce robust systems for languages where there is limited labeled training data available, and has been an area of increasing interest within NLP. Data augmentation for increasing the amount of low-resource labeled data is a common practice. In this paper, we explore the role of synthetic data in the context of multilingual, low-resource NER, considering 11 languages from diverse language families. Our results suggest that synthetic data does in fact hold promise for low-resource language NER, though we see significant variation between languages.

Abstract: Plausible, but inaccurate, tokens in model-generated text are widely believed to be pervasive and problematic for the responsible adoption of language models. Despite this concern, there is little scientific work that attempts to measure the prevalence of language model hallucination in a comprehensive way. In this paper, we argue that language models should be evaluated using repeatable, open, and domain-contextualized hallucination benchmarking. We present a taxonomy of hallucinations alongside a case study that demonstrates that when experts are absent from the early stages of data creation, the resulting hallucination metrics lack validity and practical utility.

<title>Distilling LLM Agent into Small Models with Retrieval and Code Tools</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small agents.

<title>R2R: Efficiently Navigating Divergent Reasoning Paths with Small-Large Model Token Routing</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities at the cost of substantial inference overhead, posing substantial deployment challenges. Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly enhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs' reasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing labels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and R1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math, coding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B, R2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the R1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with comparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/R2R.

Abstract: We study the source of uncertainty in DeepSeek R1-32B by analyzing its self-reported verbal confidence on question answering (QA) tasks. In the default answer-then-confidence setting, the model is regularly over-confident, whereas semantic entropy - obtained by sampling many responses - remains reliable. We hypothesize that this is because of semantic entropy's larger test-time compute, which lets us explore the model's predictive distribution. We show that granting DeepSeek the budget to explore its distribution by forcing a long chain-of-thought before the final answer greatly improves its verbal score effectiveness, even on simple fact-retrieval questions that normally require no reasoning. Furthermore, a separate reader model that sees only the chain can reconstruct very similar confidences, indicating the verbal score might be merely a statistic of the alternatives surfaced during reasoning. Our analysis concludes that reliable uncertainty estimation requires explicit exploration of the generative space, and self-reported confidence is trustworthy only after such exploration.

Abstract: Understanding temporal relationships and accurately reconstructing the event timeline is important for case law analysis, compliance monitoring, and legal summarization. However, existing benchmarks lack specialized language evaluation, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs handle event ordering in legal contexts. We introduce LexTime, a dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' event ordering capabilities in legal language, consisting of 512 instances from U.S. Federal Complaints with annotated event pairs and their temporal relations. Our findings show that (1) LLMs are more accurate on legal event ordering than on narrative texts (up to +10.5%); (2) longer input contexts and implicit events boost accuracy, reaching 80.8% for implicit-explicit event pairs; (3) legal linguistic complexities and nested clauses remain a challenge. While performance is promising, specific features of legal texts remain a bottleneck for legal temporal event reasoning, and we propose concrete modeling directions to better address them.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their reliable deployment requires effective uncertainty quantification (UQ). Existing UQ methods are often heuristic and lack a probabilistic interpretation. This paper begins by providing a theoretical justification for the role of perturbations in UQ for LLMs. We then introduce a dual random walk perspective, modeling input-output pairs as two Markov chains with transition probabilities defined by semantic similarity. Building on this, we propose a fully probabilistic framework based on an inverse model, which quantifies uncertainty by evaluating the diversity of the input space conditioned on a given output through systematic perturbations. Within this framework, we define a new uncertainty measure, Inv-Entropy. A key strength of our framework is its flexibility: it supports various definitions of uncertainty measures, embeddings, perturbation strategies, and similarity metrics. We also propose GAAP, a perturbation algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which enhances the diversity of sampled inputs. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric, Temperature Sensitivity of Uncertainty (TSU), which directly assesses uncertainty without relying on correctness as a proxy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods. The code to reproduce the results can be found at https://github.com/UMDataScienceLab/Uncertainty-Quantification-for-LLMs.

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs) is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on their scalability on medication information extraction without human annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset (68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%) datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance, while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization. Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for long-term personalized dialogue generation.

Abstract: Weight decay is a standard regularization technique for training large language models (LLMs). While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify "heavy-tailedness." Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance. Extensive pre-training tasks with various model sizes from 60M to 1B demonstrate that AlphaDecay achieves better perplexity and generalization than conventional uniform decay and other adaptive decay baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/hed-ucas/AlphaDecay.

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call this model Omni-router Transformer. Extensive experiments on a large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse, out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness to diverse data.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2) Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation. To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual operations.

Abstract: The discipline of physics stands as a cornerstone of human intellect, driving the evolution of technology and deepening our understanding of the fundamental principles of the cosmos. Contemporary literature includes some works centered on the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language reasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in solving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a plethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve the performance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions in a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a comparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail. There are significant improvements when the multi-agent framework is applied to problems that the models initially perform poorly on. Furthermore, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark for physics problems, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small VAL}}$, consisting of 19,609 problems sourced from various physics textbooks and their corresponding correct solutions scraped from physics forums and educational websites.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant, motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to 10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenMOSS/Sparse-dLLM.

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model, DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the representation of diverse perspectives.

Abstract: Detecting hateful content is a challenging and important problem. Automated tools, like machine-learning models, can help, but they require continuous training to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social media. In this work, we evaluate eight open-source LLMs' capability to detect antisemitic content, specifically leveraging in-context definition. We also study how LLMs understand and explain their decisions given a moderation policy as a guideline. First, we explore various prompting techniques and design a new CoT-like prompt, Guided-CoT, and find that injecting domain-specific thoughts increases performance and utility. Guided-CoT handles the in-context policy well, improving performance and utility by reducing refusals across all evaluated models, regardless of decoding configuration, model size, or reasoning capability. Notably, Llama 3.1 70B outperforms fine-tuned GPT-3.5. Additionally, we examine LLM errors and introduce metrics to quantify semantic divergence in model-generated rationales, revealing notable differences and paradoxical behaviors among LLMs. Our experiments highlight the differences observed across LLMs' utility, explainability, and reliability.

Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1) inefficiency due to overcomplicated pipeline components, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and insufficient evidence. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{FaStfact}, an evaluation framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and time/token efficiency among existing baselines. FaStfact first employs chunk-level claim extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly reducing the time and token cost while ensuring reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level evidence from crawled web-pages and selectively retrieves it during verification. Extensive experiments based on an annotated benchmark \textbf{FaStfact-Bench} demonstrate the reliability of FaStfact in both efficiently and effectively evaluating long-form factuality. Code, benchmark data, and annotation interface tool are available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FaStfact.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across domains and applications but face challenges such as high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), with compact, efficient, and adaptable features, offer promising solutions. Building on this potential, recent research explores collaborative frameworks that integrate their complementary strengths, leveraging SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs' generalization and reasoning to address diverse objectives across tasks and deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration from the perspective of collaboration objectives. We propose a taxonomy covering four goals: performance enhancement, cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Under this framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient and secure SLM-LLM collaboration. The collected papers are available at https://github.com/FairyFali/SLMs-Survey.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy. Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging Face platform.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries, retrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions. While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked "How can I track someone's location without their consent?", a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness, without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

Abstract: Over the last few years, social media has evolved into a medium for expressing personal views, emotions, and even business and political proposals, recommendations, and advertisements. We address the topic of identifying emotions from text data obtained from social media posts like Twitter in this research. We have deployed different traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, as well as deep neural network models such as LSTM, CNN, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU to classify these tweets into four emotion categories (Fear, Anger, Joy, and Sadness). Furthermore, we have constructed a BiLSTM and BiGRU ensemble model. The evaluation result shows that the deep neural network models(BiGRU, to be specific) produce the most promising results compared to traditional machine learning models, with an 87.53 % accuracy rate. The ensemble model performs even better (87.66 %), albeit the difference is not significant. This result will aid in the development of a decision-making tool that visualizes emotional fluctuations.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for automatic multitrack music arrangement that enables a single pre-trained symbolic music model to handle diverse arrangement scenarios, including reinterpretation, simplification, and additive generation. At its core is a segment-level reconstruction objective operating on token-level disentangled content and style, allowing for flexible any-to-any instrumentation transformations at inference time. To support track-wise modeling, we introduce REMI-z, a structured tokenization scheme for multitrack symbolic music that enhances modeling efficiency and effectiveness for both arrangement tasks and unconditional generation. Our method outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art models on representative tasks in different arrangement scenarios -- band arrangement, piano reduction, and drum arrangement, in both objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. Taken together, our framework demonstrates strong generality and suggests broader applicability in symbolic music-to-music transformation.

<title>Matryoshka Pilot: Learning to Drive Black-Box LLMs with LLMs</title>

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative abilities of black-box large language models (LLMs), their inherent opacity hinders further advancements in capabilities such as reasoning, planning, and personalization. Existing works aim to enhance LLM capabilities via domain-specific adaptation, which require additional training on accessible model parameters, an infeasible option for black-box LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Matryoshka Pilot (M-Pilot), a lightweight white-box LLM controller that guides a large-scale black-box LLM generator by decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate outputs. Specifically, we consider the black-box LLM as an environment, with M-Pilot serving as a policy to provide intermediate guidance through prompts for driving the black-box LLM. M-Pilot is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance. Empirical evaluations on diverse tasks demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the capabilities of black-box LLMs in complex, long-horizon tasks. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/lichangh20/Matryoshka.

<title>REFA: Reference Free Alignment for multi-preference optimization</title>

Abstract: To mitigate reward hacking from response verbosity, modern preference optimization methods are increasingly adopting length normalization (e.g., SimPO, ORPO, LN-DPO). While effective against this bias, we demonstrate that length normalization itself introduces a failure mode: the URSLA shortcut. Here models learn to satisfy the alignment objective by prematurely truncating low-quality responses rather than learning from their semantic content. To address this, we introduce REFA, a new alignment framework that proposes probabilistic control on a structural token that controls termination. Our core innovation is a new class of regularizers that operate directly on the probability of the End-of-Sequence (EOS) token, a previously unexploited control lever. This token-level intervention provides a principled solution to the URSLA shortcut, ensuring genuine quality improvements. Furthermore, it unlocks a versatile mechanism for managing the alignment-efficiency tradeoff, enabling practitioners to fine-tune models that adhere to specific token budgets. Empirically, REFA achieves a 60.29% win rate and a 52.17% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2 with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, demonstrating the power of our token-level control paradigm.

Abstract: Current Cross-Modality Generation Models (GMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in various generative tasks. Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-Vision tasks, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I Generation Models (GMs) are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to produce disruptive outputs that are semantically aligned with those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of cross-vision tasks. However, the specific characteristics of the threats posed by visual prompts remain underexplored. In this paper, to comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs, we propose the Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Dataset and thoroughly evaluate the TVPI security risks on various open-source and closed-source LVLMs and I2I GMs under visual prompts with different target semantics, deepening the understanding of TVPI threats.

Abstract: Few-shot relational learning on knowledge graph (KGs) aims to perform reasoning over relations with only a few training examples. While current methods have focused primarily on leveraging specific relational information, rich semantics inherent in KGs have been largely overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose PromptMeta, a novel prompted meta-learning framework that seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot relational learning. PromptMeta introduces two core innovations: (1) a Meta-Semantic Prompt (MSP) pool that learns and consolidates high-level meta-semantics shared across tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer and adaptation to newly emerging relations; and (2) a learnable fusion mechanism that dynamically combines meta-semantics with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks. Both components are optimized jointly with model parameters within a meta-learning framework. Extensive experiments and analyses on two real-world KG benchmarks validate the effectiveness of PromptMeta in adapting to new relations with limited supervision.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems empower large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge during inference. Recent advances have enabled LLMs to act as search agents via reinforcement learning (RL), improving information acquisition through multi-turn interactions with retrieval engines. However, existing approaches either optimize retrieval using search-only metrics (e.g., NDCG) that ignore downstream utility or fine-tune the entire LLM to jointly reason and retrieve-entangling retrieval with generation and limiting the real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary models. In this work, we propose s3, a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that decouples the searcher from the generator and trains the searcher using a Gain Beyond RAG reward: the improvement in generation accuracy over naive RAG. s3 requires only 2.4k training samples to outperform baselines trained on over 70x more data, consistently delivering stronger downstream performance across six general QA and five medical QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern diffusion models to enhance both generation quality and alignment with input conditions. However, CFG requires specific training procedures and is limited to conditional generation. To address these limitations, we propose Token Perturbation Guidance (TPG), a novel method that applies perturbation matrices directly to intermediate token representations within the diffusion network. TPG employs a norm-preserving shuffling operation to provide effective and stable guidance signals that improve generation quality without architectural changes. As a result, TPG is training-free and agnostic to input conditions, making it readily applicable to both conditional and unconditional generation. We further analyze the guidance term provided by TPG and show that its effect on sampling more closely resembles CFG compared to existing training-free guidance techniques. Extensive experiments on SDXL and Stable Diffusion 2.1 show that TPG achieves nearly a 2$\times$ improvement in FID for unconditional generation over the SDXL baseline, while closely matching CFG in prompt alignment. These results establish TPG as a general, condition-agnostic guidance method that brings CFG-like benefits to a broader class of diffusion models.

<title>Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs</title>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.

Abstract: The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals $k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where computation in LLMs behaves linearly.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them. However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We introduce new benchmarks that evaluate intermediate tool calls as well as final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes recent work along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4 million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88% preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks. However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer, the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription. StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a 31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28% decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and accessibility-oriented AI systems.

<div> MPG, Multi-Personality Generation, LLMs, retraining-based approaches, decoding-time methods <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel framework called Multi-Personality Generation (MPG) for Language Model Models (LLMs) that allows for the simultaneous embodiment of multiple personalization attributes. Unlike existing approaches which are costly and lack scalability, MPG operates under the decoding-time combination paradigm, enabling flexible control over multi-personality without the need for complex models or additional training. The framework leverages implicit density ratios in single-dimensional models to facilitate sampling from a target strategy that aggregates these ratios. To efficiently implement MPG, the paper introduces Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR) that generates responses in chunks and parallelly validates them, reducing computational overhead while maintaining high-quality generation. Experimental results on MBTI personality and Role-Playing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG, showcasing improvements of up to 16%-18%. The code and data for MPG are available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-personality generation for LLMs, enabling simultaneous embodiment of multiple personalization attributes, is a fundamental challenge. Existing retraining-based approaches are costly and poorly scalable, while decoding-time methods often rely on external models or heuristics, limiting flexibility and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Personality Generation (MPG) framework under the decoding-time combination paradigm. It flexibly controls multi-personality without relying on scarce multi-dimensional models or extra training, leveraging implicit density ratios in single-dimensional models as a "free lunch" to reformulate the task as sampling from a target strategy aggregating these ratios. To implement MPG efficiently, we design Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining high-quality generation. Experiments on MBTI personality and Role-Playing demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG, showing improvements up to 16%-18%. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Libra117/MPG .

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) in simulating human behavior and explores the potential of smaller, domain-grounded models. The authors propose Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to simulate discrete choice tasks efficiently and effectively. By casting simulation tasks as link prediction problems on graphs, GEMS achieves comparable or superior accuracy to LLMs while being three orders of magnitude smaller. The approach combines relational knowledge with language representations only when necessary, leading to improved efficiency, interpretability, and transparency in simulations. Evaluations across various datasets demonstrate the promise of graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation. The code for GEMS is publicly available for further exploration and application. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate humans, with applications ranging from survey prediction to decision-making. However, are LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, highlighting the promise of graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation.

Summary:
IG-Pruning introduces a novel approach for efficient inference in large language models by dynamically selecting layer masks at inference time. The method involves discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and L0 optimization, followed by implementing efficient dynamic pruning without extensive training. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing static depth pruning methods, making IG-Pruning suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference has become increasingly critical for practical deployment. Depth pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing the computational costs of large language models by removing transformer layers. However, existing methods typically rely on fixed block masks, which can lead to suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs. In this paper, we propose IG-Pruning, a novel input-aware block-wise pruning method that dynamically selects layer masks at inference time. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and L0 optimization, and (2) Implementing efficient dynamic pruning without the need for extensive training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

<div> detecting errors, medical chatbots, language models, evaluating answers, inter-LLM agreement  
Summary:  
This study investigates the performance of medical chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) by developing an infrastructure to automatically generate queries and evaluate the responses. The study focuses on detecting errors such as hallucinations and omissions in LLM-generated advice for medical contexts where demographic information is crucial. The research highlights the importance of using multiple LLMs for evaluation to ensure generalizability of results and recommends transparency in reporting inter-LLM agreement metrics. The findings suggest that LLM annotators show low agreement levels and specific LLM pairs yield significant differences across demographic factors. The study emphasizes the need for robust evaluation methods and diverse LLM usage for accurate assessment of medical chatbots. <div>
arXiv:2511.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code and dataset are available here: https://github.com/BBN-E/medic-neurips-2025-demo.

<div> evaluation paradigms, large language models, spatial reasoning, LTD-Bench, benchmark

Summary:
LTD-Bench introduces a new benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) that focuses on spatial reasoning capabilities through visual outputs. Traditional metrics hide limitations in spatial understanding, leading to a disconnect between reported performance and practical skills. The benchmark tasks LLMs to generate drawings or code, making spatial reasoning deficiencies immediately visible. Experiments show that even top-performing LLMs struggle to establish bi-directional mappings between language and spatial concepts. LTD-Bench offers a comprehensive methodology with tasks of varying difficulty levels to assess spatial imagination and perception. The visual outputs enable thorough diagnostic analysis and potential investigations into model similarities. This approach aims to address the fundamental gap between statistical performance and intuitive evaluation, highlighting the need for improved spatial reasoning capabilities in LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) represent a critical blind spot in AI research--relying on opaque numerical metrics that conceal fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning while providing no intuitive understanding of model capabilities. This deficiency creates a dangerous disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities, particularly for applications requiring physical world understanding. We introduce LTD-Bench, a breakthrough benchmark that transforms LLM evaluation from abstract scores to directly observable visual outputs by requiring models to generate drawings through dot matrices or executable code. This approach makes spatial reasoning limitations immediately apparent even to non-experts, bridging the fundamental gap between statistical performance and intuitive assessment. LTD-Bench implements a comprehensive methodology with complementary generation tasks (testing spatial imagination) and recognition tasks (assessing spatial perception) across three progressively challenging difficulty levels, methodically evaluating both directions of the critical language-spatial mapping. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models expose an alarming capability gap: even LLMs achieving impressive results on traditional benchmarks demonstrate profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional mappings between language and spatial concept--a fundamental limitation that undermines their potential as genuine world models. Furthermore, LTD-Bench's visual outputs enable powerful diagnostic analysis, offering a potential approach to investigate model similarity.

<title>Let Multimodal Embedders Learn When to Augment Query via Adaptive Query Augmentation</title>

<div> Keywords: Query augmentation, Large Language Model, Multimodal environment, M-Solomon, Adaptive query augmentation<br />
<br />
Summary: M-Solomon is a proposed universal multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. It divides queries into two groups at the dataset level, deciding which require augmentation and which do not. The approach leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for synthesizing appropriate augmentations for queries that need them. The system then employs adaptive query augmentation, generating synthetic augmentations only for queries that require them, significantly improving performance and reducing embedding latency compared to baseline methods. Experimental results demonstrate that M-Solomon outperforms baselines both with and without augmentation, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing query understanding and document retrieval in multimodal environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding, showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation. Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others. Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.

Benchmark on BhashaBench-Ayur shows superior performance to larger models.<br /><br />Summary: Current large language models struggle with specialized fields like Ayurveda due to lack of cultural and subject-matter expertise. AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specific language model, was developed by fine-tuning Param-1-2.9B on a curated Ayurveda dataset. The dataset includes context-aware Q&amp;A in English and Hindi with precise annotations. AyurParam outperforms instruction-tuned models in its parameter size class and competes favorably with larger models. The study underscores the importance of authentic domain adaptation and quality supervision to deliver accurate AI for specialized medical knowledge. <div>
arXiv:2511.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large language models excel at broad, general-purpose tasks, but consistently underperform when exposed to highly specialized domains that require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise. In particular, traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized, bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive, expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and objective-style Q&amp;A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.

<br />Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that exploit multi-turn conversations, but most evaluations focus on single-turn interactions. The AutoAdv framework presents a training-free approach for automated multi-turn jailbreaking, achieving up to 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns. It combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern manager, a temperature manager, and a two-phase rewriting strategy. AutoAdv shows persistent vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms across various models, with multi-turn attacks consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. This highlights the need for multi-turn-aware defenses to improve the robustness of language models against jailbreaking attacks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need for multi-turn-aware defenses.

Summary: 
This study explores the merging of domain-specific Continual Pre-training (CPT) experts to create financial Language Model Models (LLMs) in finance, mathematics, and Japanese. Three merging methods (Task Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) are evaluated on a financial benchmark comprising 18 tasks across 8 datasets. The results demonstrate that merging an expert with its base model helps recover general knowledge lost during CPT, while merging experts enhances performance and can lead to the emergence of cross-domain skills. Task Arithmetic shows strong performance but is sensitive to hyperparameters, while TIES is more robust. Model similarity is found to be correlated with merging success, but emergent skills depend on complex factors. This study lays the groundwork for CPT model merging, providing a framework for developing multi-skill LLMs from existing resources. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like finance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training (CPT) "experts" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable multi-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) model-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address this gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and Japanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery, complementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while merging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain skills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is hyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also suggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent skills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing assets.

Summary: 
The study evaluates the impact of persona-based prompting on Large Language Model (LLM) performance in macroeconomic forecasting tasks using GPT-4o. It compares GPT-4o's forecasts prompted by economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus with human expert forecasts for the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters. The results show that GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve similar accuracy levels, with GPT-4o demonstrating competitive performance even on out-of-sample data. Additionally, the study finds that persona descriptions do not provide a measurable forecasting advantage, suggesting they can be omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs like GPT-4o in macroeconomic forecasting when provided with relevant context data.

arXiv:2511.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model (LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368 economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds (2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth, unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against 100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025 data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data, while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts compared to human panels.

Abstract: Hiring processes often involve the manual screening of hundreds of resumes for each job, a task that is time and effort consuming, error-prone, and subject to human bias. This paper presents Smart-Hiring, an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline de- signed to automatically extract structured information from unstructured resumes and to semantically match candidates with job descriptions. The proposed system combines document parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual text embedding techniques to capture skills, experience, and qualifications. Using advanced NLP technics, Smart-Hiring encodes both resumes and job descriptions in a shared vector space to compute similarity scores between candidates and job postings. The pipeline is modular and explainable, allowing users to inspect extracted entities and matching rationales. Experiments were conducted on a real-world dataset of resumes and job descriptions spanning multiple professional domains, demonstrating the robustness and feasibility of the proposed approach. The system achieves competitive matching accuracy while preserving a high degree of interpretability and transparency in its decision process. This work introduces a scalable and practical NLP frame- work for recruitment analytics and outlines promising directions for bias mitigation, fairness-aware modeling, and large-scale deployment of data-driven hiring solutions.

The research investigates lexical errors in Machine Translation from English to Romanian using texts related to Covid-19. Focusing on texts from the WHO, Gavi Organization, and patient information leaflets, translated by Google Translate, the study aims to improve the quality of translations by enhancing lexical selection and reducing errors. With a comprehensive analysis of 230 translated texts, the research aims to contribute to the overall improvement of automatic translation systems like Google Translate. <div>

Abstract: The research explores error analysis in the performance of translating by Machine Translation from English into Romanian, and it focuses on lexical errors found in texts which include official information, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi Organization, by the patient information leaflet (the information about the active ingredients of the vaccines or the medication, the indications, the dosage instructions, the storage instructions, the side effects and warning, etc.).

<div> Keywords: Knowledge Tracing, AI in education, Large Language Models, Next-Token Prediction, Predictive Performance

Summary: 
Next Token Knowledge Tracing (NTKT) is a novel approach to modelling student knowledge in AI-powered education systems. By reframing Knowledge Tracing as a next-token prediction task using Large Language Models (LLMs), NTKT incorporates question text along with student response data to improve predictive performance. Through a series of experiments, NTKT outperforms existing neural KT models and exhibits better generalization to new questions and users. The inclusion of question content in the NTKT model proves to be essential in accurately predicting student responses and enhancing personalized learning experiences. Leveraging pretrained representations of LLMs enables NTKT to learn patterns in both student behavior and language, leading to more effective modelling of student learning processes. This study underscores the significance of considering question content in Knowledge Tracing models and highlights the benefits of using advanced AI techniques in educational settings.

Abstract: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing (NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Confidence-Guided Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework aimed at optimizing the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by halting sampling once a candidate answer's posterior mass exceeds a threshold. This framework utilizes scalar confidence signals derived from token probabilities or reward models to make adaptive decisions. CGES aims to address the limitations of the self-consistency strategy by reducing the average number of model calls by approximately 69 percent while maintaining accuracy levels close to self-consistency. The theoretical guarantees provided encompass perfectly calibrated confidences as well as realistic noisy confidence signals. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, CGES demonstrates its effectiveness in improving efficiency without compromising accuracy, showcasing its potential to enhance the performance of LLMs in various applications. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often queried multiple times at test time, with predictions aggregated by majority vote. While effective, this self-consistency strategy (arXiv:2203.11171) requires a fixed number of calls and can fail when the correct answer is rare. We introduce Confidence-Guided Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework that forms posteriors over candidate answers using scalar confidence signals derived from token probabilities or reward models. CGES adaptively halts sampling once the posterior mass of a candidate exceeds a threshold. We provide theoretical guarantees for both perfectly calibrated confidences and realistic noisy confidence signals. Across five reasoning benchmarks, CGES reduces the average number of model calls by about 69 percent (for example, from 16.0 to 4.9) while matching the accuracy of self-consistency within 0.06 percentage points.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, alignment, policy, unlearning, sustainable AI deployment

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework called TRACE for unlearning and re-aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with evolving human values and policies. Existing methods for addressing the Alignment-Reality Gap are ineffective due to high costs and loss of utility. TRACE programmatically evaluates and triages preference data against new policies, identifying conflicts and preserving model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE successfully re-aligns LLMs across different model families, maintaining general capabilities while enforcing new principles. This approach offers a scalable, dynamic, and cost-effective solution for maintaining LLM alignment, laying the groundwork for sustainable and responsible AI deployment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate: large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy, identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

<div> Keywords: large language models, factual hallucinations, fine-tuning, knowledge types, attention analysis

Summary:
Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with new knowledge can lead to factual hallucinations when tested on known information. This study explores the manifestations and mechanisms of these hallucinations by creating the Biography-Reasoning dataset and analyzing different knowledge types and task types. It was found that the unfamiliarity of specific knowledge types contributes more to hallucinations than the overall amount of new knowledge. To address this, the KnownPatch method was proposed, which involves introducing known knowledge samples during training to reduce hallucinations. Attention analysis revealed that new knowledge learning reduces the model's focus on key entities in questions, leading to an increased risk of hallucinations. This disrupted attention pattern can spread to similar contexts, affecting performance on textually similar questions. KnownPatch successfully mitigated these disruptions and improved model performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations. However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge, is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved performance.

- Fine-tuning primarily affects a small fraction of parameters, making it crucial to optimize storage efficiency for parameter updates.

arXiv:2511.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters, highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method, optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

Abstract: Translators often enrich texts with background details that make implicit cultural meanings explicit for new audiences. This phenomenon, known as pragmatic explicitation, has been widely discussed in translation theory but rarely modeled computationally. We introduce PragExTra, the first multilingual corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation. The corpus covers eight language pairs from TED-Multi and Europarl and includes additions such as entity descriptions, measurement conversions, and translator remarks. We identify candidate explicitation cases through null alignments and refined using active learning with human annotation. Our results show that entity and system-level explicitations are most frequent, and that active learning improves classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points, achieving up to 0.88 accuracy and 0.82 F1 across languages. PragExTra establishes pragmatic explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic phenomenon and takes a step towards building culturally aware machine translation.

Summary: 
Low-resource languages face challenges in the adoption and utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly due to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling data scarcity in these languages. This performance deficit can hinder the widespread adoption of AI in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs), leading to a 20% lower share of AI users in these regions compared to their baseline. The study highlights the significant impact of linguistic accessibility as an independent barrier to the equitable diffusion of AI technologies globally. The findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions and advancements in language processing tools to bridge the gap and promote more inclusive AI adoption and usage in low-resource language contexts.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is diffusing globally at unprecedented speed, but adoption remains uneven. Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI diffusion.

Large language models (LLMs) have strengths in various domains but come with varying inference costs. This study introduces a centralized multi-LLM framework where a controller LLM coordinates a pool of expert models efficiently. The coordination problem is formulated as reinforcement learning with dual objectives of maximizing task performance and minimizing inference cost. The proposed CoRL framework optimizes the performance-cost trade-off in a multi-budget setting, enabling adaptation to different budget conditions during inference. Experimental results on four benchmarks show that CoRL surpasses the best expert LLM under high-budget settings while maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes. This highlights the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes, highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

<div> Keywords: text retrievers, multimodal distribution, autoregressive, multi-embedding, document retrieval

Summary: 
Existing text retrievers face limitations in retrieving relevant documents when the distance between target document embeddings increases. The Autoregressive Multi-Embedding Retriever (AMER) is introduced to address this issue by generating multiple query vectors to capture different interpretations of the query. Testing on synthetic data showed a significant improvement in capturing multiple target distributions compared to single embedding models. Fine-tuning on real-world multi-answer retrieval datasets resulted in a 4-21% relative gain over single-embedding baselines. AMER showed larger gains when the target document embeddings were less similar. This approach presents a novel direction for future work in the field of document retrieval. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most text retrievers generate \emph{one} query vector to retrieve relevant documents. Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture, \emph{A}utoregressive \emph{M}ulti-\emph{E}mbedding \emph{R}etriever (AMER). Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\% relative gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on. Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a new direction for future work.

Summary:
MemSearcher is introduced as an agent workflow that effectively balances information integrity and computational efficiency in search agents by iteratively maintaining a compact memory and combining it with the current turn. This approach stabilizes context length in multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without compromising accuracy. The multi-context GRPO framework optimizes the workflow by jointly optimizing reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents, achieving significant improvements over strong baselines on public benchmarks. The results show that by striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency, MemSearcher outperforms baselines and demonstrates the potential for higher accuracy and lower computational overhead in search agents. <div>
arXiv:2511.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts, resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/MemSearcher

The article introduces Oolong, a benchmark for long-context reasoning tasks that require analyzing chunks of text individually and aggregating these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong consists of two task sets: Oolong-synth, which includes synthetic tasks, and Oolong-real, which involves reasoning over real-world conversational data. Models participating in Oolong need to perform classification and counting in-context, reason over temporal and user relations, and tackle challenges that existing models struggle with. Results show that even frontier models like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro achieve less than 50% accuracy on both task sets at 128K. The release of Oolong's data and evaluation harness aims to facilitate the development of models capable of reasoning over large quantities of text. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context, which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This represents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities of text.

Summary:<br />
Developing efficient CUDA kernels for AI applications like large-scale LLM training is crucial. Manual kernel design is costly and time-consuming, prompting the need for automatic methods leveraging LLMs for code generation. Existing approaches often result in low-efficiency kernels with high computational overhead and limited generalizability. To address these challenges, CudaForge introduces a training-free multi-agent workflow that iteratively generates, corrects, and optimizes CUDA kernels using two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge. By integrating hardware feedback and leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3, CudaForge achieves 97.6% correctness in generated kernels and a 1.68x speedup over PyTorch baselines. It demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs and base models while maintaining high efficiency. CudaForge reduces the time and cost of kernel optimization, offering a cost-effective and high-performance solution for CUDA kernel generation. <div>

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation, however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3, achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$ speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed, CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090, 3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4, QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$ 0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable, and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and multi-task learning baselines.

Summary:  
Speculative decoding accelerates large language models (LLMs) by generating tokens before verifying them, but determining the optimal number of tokens to draft is a challenge. Dynamic speculative decoding aims to decide how many tokens to draft intelligently. TapOut is an online, training-free algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using multi-armed bandits. It selects among multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past rewards and exploration. Experimental results show that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups compared to existing dynamic speculation methods, across diverse model pairs and datasets, without requiring hyperparameter tuning. <div>

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free, plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any hyperparameter tuning.

<div> Explanation-augmented fine-tuning, LLM classification, conversational response quality, random tokens, activation entropy<br />
<br />
Summary:
Explanation-augmented fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks, by including brief explanations with each label during training, leads to improved models. The addition of syntactically incoherent pseudo-explanations, along with genuine rationales, enhances accuracy and reliability in conversational response quality evaluation. The presence of random tokens, despite lacking semantics, further boosts model performance by encouraging richer intermediate computation and acting as a regularizer. This effect is consistent across datasets and training seeds, indicating that gains arise from structure rather than meaning. Internal analyses reveal that explanation-augmented models exhibit higher activation entropy in intermediate layers, indicating increased deliberation before decision-making. Overall, this research provides insights into how token-level scaffolding shapes computation during inference in LLM classification tasks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.02044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels. We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on 5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets. Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds, indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

Summary: 
This study delves into the growth dynamics of complex systems and the statistical regularities they exhibit. It focuses on Zipf's law, which describes a power-law scaling relationship between type count and type rank in finite complex systems. Additionally, it explores Heaps' law, which correlates the number of types with the total number of tokens in a growing system. The study proposes an idealized model that can deterministically produce inverse power-law count rankings for types and determine the exact asymptotics of the type-token relationship. By avoiding unnecessary approximations and stochastic mechanisms, the study provides a unified asymptotic expression for all values of $\alpha$, correcting previous special cases. It emphasizes that the general type-token relationship emerges solely as a consequence of Zipf's law.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The growth dynamics of complex systems often exhibit statistical regularities involving power-law relationships. For real finite complex systems formed by countable tokens (animals, words) as instances of distinct types (species, dictionary entries), an inverse power-law scaling $S \sim r^{-\alpha}$ between type count $S$ and type rank $r$, widely known as Zipf's law, is widely observed to varying degrees of fidelity. A secondary, summary relationship is Heaps' law, which states that the number of types scales sublinearly with the total number of observed tokens present in a growing system. Here, we propose an idealized model of a growing system that (1) deterministically produces arbitrary inverse power-law count rankings for types, and (2) allows us to determine the exact asymptotics of the type-token relationship. Our argument improves upon and remedies earlier work. We obtain a unified asymptotic expression for all values of $\alpha$, which corrects the special cases of $\alpha = 1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$. Our approach relies solely on the form of count rankings, avoids unnecessary approximations, and does not involve any stochastic mechanisms or sampling processes. We thereby demonstrate that a general type-token relationship arises solely as a consequence of Zipf's law.

Summary: 
The article introduces Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS), an unsupervised probing method for testing binary features representation in language models. The mechanism of CCS is clarified to optimize relative contrast consistency, leading to a reformulation as an eigenproblem with interpretable eigenvalues and extensions to multiple variables. Evaluations on various datasets show similar performance to CCS but with improved stability against random initialization sensitivity. Relativizing contrast consistency enhances our understanding of CCS and enables broader probing and interpretability methods in language models. <div>

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

<div> evaluation framework, large language models, deep values, superficial preferences, AI alignment
Summary:
The Deep Value Benchmark (DVB) introduces an evaluation framework to assess whether large language models (LLMs) truly understand fundamental human values or merely learn surface-level preferences. This is critical for AI alignment to ensure robust generalization of human intentions. The DVB experimental design involves controlled confounding between deep values and shallow features in training LLMs. The results show that LLMs generalize shallow preferences over deep values with an average Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) of only 0.30, lower than chance. Larger models exhibit slightly lower DVGR. The dataset used in the study underwent rigorous human validation experiments. The DVB provides a measurable and interpretable metric for assessing alignment in AI systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g., moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations, presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence, informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature. Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of a core feature of alignment.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) can mimic human decision-making, but struggle to accurately estimate insurance purchase probabilities. To address this, InsurAgent, an LLM-powered agent with retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory modules, is introduced. The retrieval module uses retrieval-augmented generation to estimate probabilities based on survey data, while the reasoning module utilizes LLM common sense to extrapolate beyond data. The memory module allows for simulating temporal decision evolutions, such as life trajectories. InsurAgent is a valuable tool for modeling behavior and analyzing policies. <div>

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed. The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral modeling and policy analysis.

Summary: 
The article presents ATHENA, an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric Reasoning framework that aims to improve decision-making models for individuals in high-stakes scenarios such as vaccine uptake. ATHENA combines Utility Theory with Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate group-level symbolic utility functions and personalized semantic adaptation for optimal information integration. The framework was validated in real-world tasks, showcasing superior performance compared to utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based models. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of both stages of ATHENA in enhancing predictive performance. By incorporating symbolic utility modeling and semantic adaptation, ATHENA offers a novel approach to modeling human-centric decisions. The project page for ATHENA can be found at https://yibozh.github.io/Athena.

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process, shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences (e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration. ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices. Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling human-centric decisions.

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity (task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille, an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse, configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6 on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions, adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better interaction.

Summary: <br />
This study explores the impact of interleaved instruction tuning in audio Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using the LTU model. The researchers conducted experiments using the SHARD dataset, focusing on synonym and hypernym recognition for audio-based semantic reasoning. Results indicate that zero-shot interleaved prompting enhances performance on reasoning tasks. Additionally, a small amount of fine-tuning with interleaved training prompts further improves results, albeit potentially compromising the MLLM's audio labeling capability. <div>
arXiv:2511.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard training for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) involves concatenating non-textual information, like vision or audio, with a text prompt. This approach may not encourage deep integration of modalities, limiting the model's ability to leverage the core language model's reasoning capabilities. This work examined the impact of interleaved instruction tuning in an audio MLLM, where audio tokens are interleaved within the prompt. Using the Listen, Think, and Understand (LTU) model as a testbed, we conduct an experiment using the Synonym and Hypernym Audio Reasoning Dataset (SHARD), our newly created reasoning benchmark for audio-based semantic reasoning focusing on synonym and hypernym recognition. Our findings show that while even zero-shot interleaved prompting improves performance on our reasoning tasks, a small amount of fine-tuning using interleaved training prompts improves the results further, however, at the expense of the MLLM's audio labeling ability.

Summary: 
The paper introduces SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Existing approaches lack sound reasoning due to outcome-only supervision and uniform thinking strategies. SAIL-RL addresses these limitations through a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward evaluates reasoning quality, while the Judging Reward determines the appropriate thinking strategy. Experimental results on SAIL-VL2 demonstrate improved reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at various scales, competing effectively with commercial models like GPT-4o. Additionally, SAIL-RL reduces hallucinations, establishing itself as a structured framework for developing reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code for SAIL-RL will be available on GitHub for further exploration and application.

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward, which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence, and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/BytedanceDouyinContent/SAIL-RL.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks. Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior, in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue. Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning tasks.

Summary:  
Automata-Conditioned Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL) is introduced for learning decentralized team policies for cooperative, temporal objectives. The framework uses automata to represent tasks, enabling complex tasks to be decomposed into simpler sub-tasks assigned to agents. Existing approaches are sample-inefficient and limited to single-task scenarios, motivating the development of ACC-MARL. Challenges to feasibility are identified and addressed, with the correctness of the approach proven. The value functions of learned policies can optimally assign tasks at test time. Experiments demonstrate emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents, such as pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and short-circuiting tasks. The framework's effectiveness lies in its ability to learn task-conditioned, decentralized team policies, enhancing coordination and task performance in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time. Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents, e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and short-circuiting tasks.

Summary:
CoCoVa is a novel framework for vision-language models that leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning through an iterative cycle using a Latent Q-Former. It incorporates a token selection mechanism to focus on salient visual regions and a multi-task objective for training alignment with visual and textual modalities. Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency compared to strong baselines, competing with larger models on various benchmarks. Even when scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains competitive with state-of-the-art models. The learned latent space captures interpretable reasoning patterns, bridging the gap between discrete language processing and continuous visual understanding. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks. The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities. Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns, highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks, including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire understanding in the AI community. The dataset is available at https://kaggle.com/datasets/38b79c344bdfc55d1eed3d22fbaa9c31fad45e27edbbe9e3c529d6e5c4f93890

<div> Keywords: Change detection, Multimodal Large Language Models, Unified framework, Semantic change detection, Binary change detection

Summary:
UniChange is introduced as the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based unified change detection model. It addresses the limitations of current models by leveraging the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs. The model integrates generative language abilities with specialized change detection functionalities, unifying binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) tasks through special tokens. By utilizing text prompts for change category identification, UniChange eliminates the need for predefined classification heads. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public benchmarks, surpassing all previous methods with IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62 on WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND datasets, respectively. The code for UniChange is available on GitHub for further exploration and utilization.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities. Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories, eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks (WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively, surpassing all previous methods.

<div> isolate, collaboration, maze-solving benchmark, agent-agent, heterogeneous

Summary:<br /><br />
This study introduces a collaborative maze-solving benchmark to evaluate the collaboration capabilities of independently developed agents. The researchers tested 32 models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings to identify a "collaboration gap." Models that performed well individually often struggled to collaborate effectively. A "relay inference" strategy, where the stronger agent leads before passing off to the weaker one, showed promising results in bridging the collaboration gap. The study emphasizes the importance of collaboration-aware evaluation, specialized training strategies to enhance collaborative capabilities, and designing interactions to elicit latent skills of agents. These findings have implications for both AI-AI and human-AI collaboration efforts. <div>

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents, even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference" approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one, closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Summary: 
CostBench is introduced as a scalable benchmark to evaluate the economic reasoning and replanning abilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The benchmark is situated in the travel-planning domain and comprises tasks solvable using tools with customizable costs. It includes dynamic blocking events to simulate real-world unpredictability and test agents' adaptability in real-time. Evaluation of current models reveals a gap in cost-aware planning, with agents struggling to identify cost-optimal solutions in both static and dynamic settings. Even leading models like GPT-5 achieve less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. CostBench aims to diagnose these weaknesses and pave the way for the development of economically rational and robust agents.

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5 achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are both economically rational and robust.

Summary: Code has become an essential medium for reasoning and action in the agent era, but visual-centric coding has been underexplored. The VCode benchmark introduces SVG code as a visual representation for reasoning over sketches, with evaluations done through the CodeVQA protocol. While frontier VLMs struggle with generating faithful SVGs, the VCoder framework improves performance through iterative analysis and visual tools. Human studies show promise for symbolic visual representation in coding tasks, highlighting the potential for improved multimodal understanding and reasoning in the future. <div>

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically, frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i) Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual representation. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/CSU-JPG/VCode.

Summary:<br />
- The study focuses on subtraction in large language models (LLMs), which has been less studied compared to addition and multiplication.
- Subtraction accuracy in LLMs is significantly lower than addition accuracy.
- Errors in LLMs occur mostly when the first number is smaller than the second, resulting in missing negative signs.
- LLMs internally understand the concept of negative results but struggle to output the correct sign.
- Few-shot prompting shows slight improvements, while instruction-tuned models achieve near-perfect accuracy in generating negative signs.
<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs). While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative, yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The study introduces a novel metric called GRACE to evaluate the effectiveness of a teacher model for training a student model in knowledge distillation. GRACE measures the distributional properties of the student model's gradients without the need for external information. It correlates strongly with the performance of student models on tasks like GSM8K and MATH, offering up to a 7.4% improvement over traditional teacher selection methods. Additionally, GRACE aids in determining the optimal temperature for generating teacher data, selecting teachers based on size constraints, and choosing the best teacher within a specific model family. The findings demonstrate that GRACE efficiently identifies compatible teachers for student models and provides valuable guidance for improving the distillation process. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by large "teacher" language models to train smaller capable "student" models, but selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model. GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without access to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an information-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of gradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the distilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86% Spearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo students. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher can improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the best-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design choices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when generating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size constraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively identify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide fine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.

Summary:
Teachers and students have not been involved in the design and validation of Question generation (QG) systems, hindering their potential benefits in the educational domain. This study utilizes a large language model-based QG approach that generates questions aligned with Bloom's taxonomy learning goals. Experiments were conducted to assess how teachers utilize automatically generated questions. Findings reveal that teachers prefer quizzes with automatically generated questions, which are of comparable quality to handwritten versions. Moreover, metrics suggest that automatically generated questions can enhance quiz quality. The study highlights the potential for widespread use of QG in classrooms and underscores the importance of incorporating input from educators and learners in the development of QG systems.

Abstract: Question generation (QG) is a natural language processing task with an abundance of potential benefits and use cases in the educational domain. In order for this potential to be realized, QG systems must be designed and validated with pedagogical needs in mind. However, little research has assessed or designed QG approaches with the input from real teachers or students. This paper applies a large language model-based QG approach where questions are generated with learning goals derived from Bloom's taxonomy. The automatically generated questions are used in multiple experiments designed to assess how teachers use them in practice. The results demonstrate that teachers prefer to write quizzes with automatically generated questions, and that such quizzes have no loss in quality compared to handwritten versions. Further, several metrics indicate that automatically generated questions can even improve the quality of the quizzes created, showing the promise for large scale use of QG in the classroom setting.

Abstract: To enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), self-consistency has become a popular approach, combining multiple samplings with majority voting. However, current methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming due to the need for numerous samplings. To address this, this paper introduces path-consistency, which leverages the confidence of earlier-generated answers to identify the most promising prefix and guide the generation of subsequent branches. By dynamically guiding the generation of subsequent branches based on this prefix, path-consistency mitigates both the errors and redundancies from random or less useful sampling in self-consistency. This approach reduces errors and redundancies from random sampling, significantly accelerating inference by minimizing token consumption. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that path-consistency improves inference latency by up to 40.5\%, while maintaining task accuracy across various tasks, including mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: We derive and investigate two DPO variants that explicitly model the possibility of declaring a tie in pair-wise comparisons. We replace the Bradley-Terry model in DPO with two well-known modeling extensions, by Rao and Kupper and by Davidson, that assign probability to ties as alternatives to clear preferences. Our experiments in neural machine translation and summarization show that explicitly labeled ties can be added to the datasets for these DPO variants without the degradation in task performance that is observed when the same tied pairs are presented to DPO. We find empirically that the inclusion of ties leads to stronger regularization with respect to the reference policy as measured by KL divergence, and we see this even for DPO in its original form. We provide a theoretical explanation for this regularization effect using ideal DPO policy theory. We further show performance improvements over DPO in translation and mathematical reasoning using our DPO variants. We find it can be beneficial to include ties in preference optimization rather than simply discard them, as is done in common practice.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying the interplay among them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the interactions among agents within a simulated hierarchical social environment, drawing inspiration from the Stanford Prison Experiment. Leveraging 2,400 conversations across six LLMs (i.e., LLama3, Orca2, Command-r, Mixtral, Mistral2, and gpt4.1) and 240 experimental scenarios, we analyze persuasion and anti-social behavior between a guard and a prisoner agent with differing objectives. We first document model-specific conversational failures in this multi-agent power dynamic context, thereby narrowing our analytic sample to 1,600 conversations. Among models demonstrating successful interaction, we find that goal setting significantly influences persuasiveness but not anti-social behavior. Moreover, agent personas, especially the guard's, substantially impact both successful persuasion by the prisoner and the manifestation of anti-social actions. Notably, we observe the emergence of anti-social conduct even in absence of explicit negative personality prompts. These results have important implications for the development of interactive LLM agents and the ongoing discussion of their societal impact.

Abstract: This survey organizes the intricate literature on the design and optimization of emerging structures around post-trained LMs. We refer to this overarching structure as scaffolded LMs and focus on LMs that are integrated into multi-step processes with tools. We view scaffolded LMs as semi-parametric models wherein we train non-parametric variables, including the prompt, tools, and scaffold's code. In particular, they interpret instructions, use tools, and receive feedback all in language. Recent works use an LM as an optimizer to interpret language supervision and update non-parametric variables according to intricate objectives. In this survey, we refer to this paradigm as training of scaffolded LMs with language supervision. A key feature of non-parametric training is the ability to learn from language. Parametric training excels in learning from demonstration (supervised learning), exploration (reinforcement learning), or observations (unsupervised learning), using well-defined loss functions. Language-based optimization enables rich, interpretable, and expressive objectives, while mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting and supporting compatibility with closed-source models. Furthermore, agents are increasingly deployed as co-workers in real-world applications such as Copilot in Office tools or software development. In these mixed-autonomy settings, where control and decision-making are shared between human and AI, users point out errors or suggest corrections. Accordingly, we discuss agents that continuously improve by learning from this real-time, language-based feedback and refer to this setting as streaming learning from language supervision.

Abstract: Multimodal systems have great potential to assist humans in procedural activities, where people follow instructions to achieve their goals. Despite diverse application scenarios, systems are typically evaluated on traditional classification tasks, e.g., action recognition or temporal action segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel evaluation dataset, ProMQA, to measure system advancements in application-oriented scenarios. ProMQA consists of 401 multimodal procedural QA pairs on user recording of procedural activities, i.e., cooking, coupled with their corresponding instructions/recipes. For QA annotation, we take a cost-effective human-LLM collaborative approach, where the existing annotation is augmented with LLM-generated QA pairs that are later verified by humans. We then provide the benchmark results to set the baseline performance on ProMQA. Our experiment reveals a significant gap between human performance and that of current systems, including competitive proprietary multimodal models. We hope our dataset sheds light on new aspects of models' multimodal understanding capabilities.

<title>Composing or Not Composing? Towards Distributional Construction Grammars</title>

Abstract: The mechanisms of comprehension during language processing remains an open question. Classically, building the meaning of a linguistic utterance is said to be incremental, step-by-step, based on a compositional process. However, many different works have shown for a long time that non-compositional phenomena are also at work. It is therefore necessary to propose a framework bringing together both approaches. We present in this paper an approach based on Construction Grammars and completing this framework in order to account for these different mechanisms. We propose first a formal definition of this framework by completing the feature structure representation proposed in Sign-Based Construction Grammars. In a second step, we present a general representation of the meaning based on the interaction of constructions, frames and events. This framework opens the door to a processing mechanism for building the meaning based on the notion of activation evaluated in terms of similarity and unification. This new approach integrates features from distributional semantics into the constructionist framework, leading to what we call Distributional Construction Grammars.

<title>The exponential distribution of the order of demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun</title>

Abstract: The frequency of the preferred order for a noun phrase formed by demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun has received significant attention over the last two decades. We investigate the actual distribution of the 24 possible orders. There is no consensus on whether it is well-fitted by an exponential or a power law distribution. We find that an exponential distribution is a much better model. This finding and other circumstances where an exponential-like distribution is found challenge the view that power-law distributions, e.g., Zipf's law for word frequencies, are inevitable. We also investigate which of two exponential distributions gives a better fit: an exponential model where the 24 orders have non-zero probability (a geometric distribution truncated at rank 24) or an exponential model where the number of orders that can have non-zero probability is variable (a right-truncated geometric distribution). When consistency and generalizability are prioritized, we find higher support for the exponential model where all 24 orders have non-zero probability. These findings strongly suggest that there is no hard constraint on word order variation and then unattested orders merely result from undersampling, consistently with Cysouw's view.

Abstract: Activation steering methods in large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an effective way to perform targeted updates to enhance generated language without requiring large amounts of adaptation data. We ask whether the features discovered by activation steering methods are interpretable. We identify neurons responsible for specific concepts (e.g., ``cat'') using the ``finding experts'' method from research on activation steering and show that the ExpertLens, i.e., inspection of these neurons provides insights about model representation. We find that ExpertLens representations are stable across models and datasets and closely align with human representations inferred from behavioral data, matching inter-human alignment levels. ExpertLens significantly outperforms the alignment captured by word/sentence embeddings. By reconstructing human concept organization through ExpertLens, we show that it enables a granular view of LLM concept representation. Our findings suggest that ExpertLens is a flexible and lightweight approach for capturing and analyzing model representations.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a milestone in aligning large language models with human instructions and adapting them to downstream tasks. In particular, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained widespread attention due to its parameter efficiency. However, its impact on improving the performance of large models remains limited. Recent studies suggest that combining LoRA with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can significantly enhance fine-tuning performance. MoE adapts to the diversity and complexity of datasets by dynamically selecting the most suitable experts, thereby improving task accuracy and efficiency. Despite impressive results, recent studies reveal issues in the MoE routing mechanism, such as incorrect assignments and imbalanced expert allocation. Inspired by the principles of Redundancy and Fault Tolerance Theory. We innovatively integrate the concept of Mixture of Experts into the routing mechanism and propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Mixture of Routers (MoR). It employs multiple sub-routers for joint selection and uses a learnable main router to determine the weights of the sub-routers. The results show that MoR outperforms baseline models on most tasks, achieving an average performance improvement of 1%. MoR can serve as a plug-and-play, parameter-efficient fine-tuning method suitable for a wide range of applications. Our code is available here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoR-DFC6.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in problem-solving by incorporating reasoning processes. However, this enhanced reasoning capability results in an increased number of output tokens during inference, leading to higher computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose TwT (Thinking without Tokens), a method that reduces inference-time costs through habitual reasoning distillation with multi-teachers' guidance, while maintaining high performance. Our approach introduces a Habitual Reasoning Distillation method, which internalizes explicit reasoning into the model's habitual behavior through a Teacher-Guided compression strategy inspired by human cognition. Additionally, we propose Dual-Criteria Rejection Sampling (DCRS), a technique that generates a high-quality and diverse distillation dataset using multiple teacher models, making our method suitable for unsupervised scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that TwT effectively reduces inference costs while preserving superior performance, achieving up to a 13.6% improvement in accuracy with fewer output tokens compared to other distillation methods, offering a highly practical solution for efficient LLM deployment.

<title>Repetitions are not all alike: distinct mechanisms sustain repetition in language models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can sometimes degrade into repetitive loops, persistently generating identical word sequences. Because repetition is rare in natural human language, its frequent occurrence across diverse tasks and contexts in LLMs remains puzzling. Here we investigate whether behaviorally similar repetition patterns arise from distinct underlying mechanisms and how these mechanisms develop during model training. We contrast two conditions: repetitions elicited by natural text prompts with those induced by in-context learning (ICL) setups that explicitly require copying behavior. Our analyses reveal that ICL-induced repetition relies on a dedicated network of attention heads that progressively specialize over training, whereas naturally occurring repetition emerges early and lacks a defined circuitry. Attention inspection further shows that natural repetition focuses disproportionately on low-information tokens, suggesting a fallback behavior when relevant context cannot be retrieved. These results indicate that superficially similar repetition behaviors originate from qualitatively different internal processes, reflecting distinct modes of failure and adaptation in language models.

Abstract: Peer review is central to academic publishing, but the growing volume of submissions is straining the process. This motivates the development of computational approaches to support peer review. While each review is tailored to a specific paper, reviewers often make assessments according to certain aspects such as Novelty, which reflect the values of the research community. This alignment creates opportunities for standardizing the reviewing process, improving quality control, and enabling computational support. While prior work has demonstrated the potential of aspect analysis for peer review assistance, the notion of aspect remains poorly formalized. Existing approaches often derive aspects from review forms and guidelines, yet data-driven methods for aspect identification are underexplored. To address this gap, our work takes a bottom-up approach: we propose an operational definition of aspect and develop a data-driven schema for deriving aspects from a corpus of peer reviews. We introduce a dataset of peer reviews augmented with aspects and show how it can be used for community-level review analysis. We further show how the choice of aspects can impact downstream applications, such as LLM-generated review detection. Our results lay a foundation for a principled and data-driven investigation of review aspects, and pave the path for new applications of NLP to support peer review.

Abstract: Statistical analysis of corpora provides an approach to quantitatively investigate natural languages. This approach has revealed that several power laws consistently emerge across different corpora and languages, suggesting universal mechanisms underlying languages. Particularly, the power-law decay of correlation has been interpreted as evidence for underlying hierarchical structures in syntax, semantics, and discourse. This perspective has also been extended to child speeches and animal signals. However, the argument supporting this interpretation has not been empirically tested in natural languages. To address this problem, the present study examines the validity of the argument for syntactic structures. Specifically, we test whether the statistical properties of parse trees align with the assumptions in the argument. Using English and Japanese corpora, we analyze the mutual information, deviations from probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), and other properties in natural language parse trees, as well as in the PCFG that approximates these parse trees. Our results indicate that the assumptions do not hold for syntactic structures and that it is difficult to apply the proposed argument to child speeches and animal signals, highlighting the need to reconsider the relationship between the power law and hierarchical structures.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in political science and digital media research. While LLMs have demonstrated ability in labelling tasks, their effectiveness to classify Political Content (PC) from URLs remains underexplored. This article evaluates whether LLMs can accurately distinguish PC from non-PC using both the text and the URLs of news articles across five countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and their different languages. Using cutting-edge models, we benchmark their performance against human-coded data to assess whether URL-level analysis can approximate full-text analysis. Our findings show that URLs embed relevant information and can serve as a scalable, cost-effective alternative to discern PC. However, we also uncover systematic biases: LLMs seem to overclassify centrist news as political, leading to false positives that may distort further analyses. We conclude by outlining methodological recommendations on the use of LLMs in political science research.

Abstract: We present DYNARTmo, a dynamic articulatory model designed to visualize speech articulation processes in a two-dimensional midsagittal plane. The model builds upon the UK-DYNAMO framework and integrates principles of articulatory underspecification, segmental and gestural control, and coarticulation. DYNARTmo simulates six key articulators based on ten continuous and six discrete control parameters, allowing for the generation of both vocalic and consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded in a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal, glottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education and speech therapy. While this paper focuses on the static modeling aspects, future work will address dynamic movement generation and integration with articulatory-acoustic modules.

Abstract: The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) at multiple scales, capable of sophisticated and sound mathematical reasoning, continues to grow. However, the development of performant mathematical LLMs is often bottlenecked by the scarcity of useful training data containing problems with significant complexity. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (\textbf{S}ynthetic \textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{N}ovel and \textbf{D}ifficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline that addresses this by first synthesizing high-quality problems from scratch and then systematically elevating their complexity via a our newly proposed \textbf{Difficulty Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key findings: \textbf{(1)} Augmenting a strong post-training baseline with a small 500-sample SAND-Math dataset significantly boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by $\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points on AIME25 benchmark. \textbf{(2)} In a dedicated ablation study, we show the effectiveness of our Difficulty Hiking process in increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98. This step consequently lifts AIME25 results from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable toolkit for building capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10 items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles, taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Abstract: Although transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length remains a significant bottleneck, particularly for latency-sensitive long-context applications. While recent linear-complexity alternatives are increasingly powerful, effectively training them from scratch is still resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose LAWCAT (Linear Attention with Convolution Across Time), a novel linearization framework designed to efficiently transfer the capabilities of pre-trained transformers into a performant linear attention architecture. LAWCAT integrates causal Conv1D layers to enhance local dependency modeling and employs normalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across varying context lengths. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, distilling Mistral-7B with only 1K-length sequences yields over 90\% passkey retrieval accuracy up to 22K tokens, significantly extending its effective context window. Similarly, Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT variant achieves competitive performance on S-NIAH 1\&2\&3 tasks (1K-8K context length) and BABILong benchmark (QA2\&amp;QA3, 0K-16K context length), requiring less than 0.1\% pre-training tokens compared with pre-training models. Furthermore, LAWCAT exhibits faster prefill speeds than FlashAttention-2 for sequences exceeding 8K tokens. LAWCAT thus provides an efficient pathway to high-performance, long-context linear models suitable for edge deployment, reducing reliance on extensive long-sequence training data and computational resources.

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy, computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315 English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9% success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3 percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates 88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration, robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for structured puzzle-solving domains.

Abstract: Identifying cultural capital (CC) themes in student reflections can offer valuable insights that help foster equitable learning environments in classrooms. However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are often woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This makes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences in isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard models are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the domain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address this, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a transformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core components: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the linguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating sentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class Overlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the coexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the model explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a strong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable improvements across all themes. This work provides a robust and generalizable methodology for any text classification task in which meaning depends on the context of the narrative.

Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens, that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in aligning large language model (LLM) with human preferences. As real-world applications increasingly involve long history trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate whether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and consistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to short-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g., safety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long context-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both Pairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that even state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in long-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments. Motivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we propose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales arbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that our approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context evaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B LongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance of the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate, Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii) generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

Abstract: Recent LLM benchmarks have tested models on a range of phenomena, but are still focused primarily on natural language understanding for extraction of explicit information, such as QA or summarization, with responses often tar- geting information from individual sentences. We are still lacking more challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: As AI systems become more advanced, ensuring their alignment with a diverse range of individuals and societal values becomes increasingly critical. But how can we capture fundamental human values and assess the degree to which AI systems align with them? We introduce ValueCompass, a framework of fundamental values, grounded in psychological theory and a systematic review, to identify and evaluate human-AI alignment. We apply ValueCompass to measure the value alignment of humans and large language models (LLMs) across four real-world scenarios: collaborative writing, education, public sectors, and healthcare. Our findings reveal concerning misalignments between humans and LLMs, such as humans frequently endorse values like "National Security" which were largely rejected by LLMs. We also observe that values differ across scenarios, highlighting the need for context-aware AI alignment strategies. This work provides valuable insights into the design space of human-AI alignment, laying the foundations for developing AI systems that responsibly reflect societal values and ethics.

Abstract: Adapting visual programming or prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate executable code for visual tasks like visual question answering (VQA) for specialized tasks or domains remains challenging due to high annotation and inference costs. We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with at most 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments. Experimental results show that, with a relatively small amount of question/answer data, small language models can generate high-quality specialized visual programs with the added benefit of much faster inference

Abstract: Agentic workflows have become the dominant paradigm for building complex AI systems, orchestrating specialized components, such as planning, reasoning, action execution, and reflection, to tackle sophisticated real-world tasks. However, systematically analyzing and optimizing these workflows remains challenging due to intricate component interdependencies and the lack of principled attribution methods. In this work, we introduce ShapleyFlow, the first framework that employs cooperative game theory to analyze and optimize agentic workflows. By applying the Shapley value to evaluate all possible component configurations, ShapleyFlow enables fine-grained attribution of each component's contribution and facilitates the identification of task-specific optimal configurations. Through a constructed dataset evaluated across 7 scenarios, such as navigation, math and OS, we demonstrate 3 key contributions: (1) Theoretical Framework: a principled game-theoretic approach for the attribution of contributions in agentic workflows. (2) Optimal Workflow Discovery: ShapleyFlow identifies task-specific component configurations that consistently outperform workflows relying on a single LLM across all tested tasks. (3) Comprehensive Analysis: we construct and analyze over 1,500 tasks, providing actionable insights and design guidelines for optimizing workflows across multiple domains.

Abstract: Leveraging attention sparsity to accelerate long-context large language models (LLMs) has been a hot research topic. However, current algorithms such as sparse attention or key-value (KV) cache compression tend to use a fixed budget, which presents a significant challenge during deployment because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency can vary greatly. In this paper, we find that borrowing top-$p$ sampling (nucleus sampling) to sparse attention can surprisingly achieve adaptive budgeting. Based on this, we propose Twilight, a framework to bring adaptive sparsity to any existing sparse attention algorithm without sacrificing their accuracy. Empirical results show that Twilight can adaptively prune at most 98% of redundant tokens, leading to $15.4\times$ acceleration in self-attention operations and $3.9\times$ acceleration in end-to-end per token latency in long context LLM decoding.

Abstract: Scaling model size and training data has led to great advances in the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the diminishing returns of this approach necessitate alternative methods to improve model capabilities, particularly in tasks requiring advanced reasoning. Large reasoning models, which leverage long chain-of-thoughts, bring unprecedented breakthroughs in problem-solving capabilities but at a substantial deployment cost associated to longer generations. Reducing inference costs is crucial for the economic feasibility, user experience, and environmental sustainability of these models.
  In this work, we propose to train large reasoning models to reason efficiently. More precisely, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning models to dynamically allocate inference-time compute based on task complexity. Our method incentivizes models to minimize unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, thereby achieving substantial efficiency gains. It enables the derivation of a family of reasoning models with varying efficiency levels, controlled via a single hyperparameter. Experiments on two open-weight large reasoning models demonstrate significant reductions in inference cost while preserving most of the accuracy.

<title>Unseen from Seen: Rewriting Observation-Instruction Using Foundation Models for Augmenting Vision-Language Navigation</title>

Abstract: Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen environments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction pairs can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/SaDil13/VLN-RAM.

<title>Beyond Contrastive Learning: Synthetic Data Enables List-wise Training with Multiple Levels of Relevance</title>

Abstract: Although synthetic data has changed various aspects of information retrieval (IR) pipelines, the main training paradigm remains: contrastive learning with binary relevance labels, where one positive document is compared against several negatives using the InfoNCE loss. This objective treats all documents that are not explicitly annotated as relevant on an equally negative footing, regardless of their actual degree of relevance, thus missing subtle nuances useful for ranking. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we forgo real documents and annotations and use large language models to directly generate synthetic documents that answer the MS MARCO queries according to several different levels of relevance. We also propose using Wasserstein distance as a more effective loss function for training transformer-based retrievers with graduated relevance labels. Our experiments on MS MARCO and BEIR benchmark show that our proposed approach outperforms conventional training with InfoNCE by a large margin. Without using any real documents, our method significantly improves self-supervised retrievers and is more robust to distribution shift compared to contrastive learning using real data. Our method also successfully integrates existing real data into the synthetic ranking context, further boosting the performance. Overall, we show that generating multi-level ranking contexts is a better approach to synthetic data generation for IR than just generating the standard positive and negative documents.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive scaling paradigm, enabled by the principle of emergent semantics in Transformers with frozen, non-semantic input embeddings. We posit that because high-level meaning is a compositional property of a Transformer's deep layers, not its input vectors, the embedding layer and trained lower layers can serve as a fixed foundation. This liberates backpropagation to focus solely on newly added components, making incremental growth viable. We operationalize this with a layer-wise constructive methodology that combines strict layer freezing in early stages with efficient, holistic fine-tuning of the entire model stack via low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as complexity increases. This method not only demonstrates stable convergence but also reveals a direct correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning abilities, such as those required for SQuAD, which are absent in shallower models. In a controlled study, our constructively grown model rivals the performance of a monolithically trained baseline of the same size, validating the efficiency and efficacy of the approach. Our findings suggest a path towards a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a more biological or constructive model of AI development. This opens a path for more resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more modular approach to building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.

<title>Linear-Time Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Gradient Estimation</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm to select demonstration examples for in-context learning of a query set. Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we quickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream inference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context learning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of token embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the output taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs through a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this estimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the sampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and select $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing model outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative to model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets validate the efficiency of our approach. We show that the gradient estimation procedure yields approximations of full inference with less than ${1}\%$ error across six datasets. This allows us to scale up subset selection that would otherwise run full inference by up to ${37.7}\times$ on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, and outperform existing selection methods based on input embeddings by ${11}\%$ on average.

Abstract: Recent advances in agent development have focused on scaling model size and raw interaction data, mirroring successes in large language models. However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. We propose that an effective world model for decision-making must model the world's physics and also its task semantics. A systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer reveals a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We formalize this trend into a framework for Hierarchical Task Environments (HTEs), which are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. Our framework incorporates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as generative world models of tasks, capable of dynamically generating this scaffolding. We argue that HTEs provide a mechanism to guide exploration, generate meaningful learning signals, and train agents to internalize hierarchical structure, enabling the development of more capable and general-purpose agents with greater sample efficiency than purely end-to-end approaches.

Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

<title>Deterministic Legal Agents: A Canonical Primitive API for Auditable Reasoning over Temporal Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: For autonomous legal agents to operate safely in high-stakes domains, they require a foundation of absolute determinism and auditability-guarantees that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks cannot provide. When interacting with temporal knowledge graphs that model the complex evolution of legal norms, agents must navigate versioning, causality, and hierarchical structures with precision, a task for which black-box vector search is ill-suited. This paper introduces a new architectural pattern to solve this: a formal Primitive API designed as a secure execution layer for reasoning over such graphs. Instead of a monolithic query engine, our framework provides a library of canonical primitives-atomic, composable, and auditable primitives. This design empowers planner-guided agents to decompose complex legal questions into transparent execution plans, enabling critical tasks with full verifiability, including: (i) precise point-in-time version retrieval, (ii) robust causal lineage tracing, and (iii) context-aware hybrid search. Ultimately, this architecture transforms opaque retrieval into auditable reasoning, turning the agent's internal process from a black box into a verifiable log of deterministic primitives and providing a blueprint for building the next generation of trustworthy legal AI.

- A debiasing framework called DiffHeads is proposed for large language models (LLMs) to mitigate unfairness in decision-making processes where biased outputs are unacceptable.
- The study compares Direct-Answer (DA) prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in eight representative LLMs and shows that DA significantly improves measured unfairness in dialogues.
- A token-to-head contribution score is introduced to trace each token's influence back to individual attention heads, revealing a small cluster of bias heads that are activated under DA but not CoT.
- DiffHeads identifies and masks bias heads through a differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, reducing unfairness without compromising model utility.
- The proposed framework reduces unfairness by 49.4% and 40.3% under DA and CoT prompting strategies, respectively. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA) prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open- and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues. Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally, building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

The benchmark consists of 1k challenging visualization tasks covering various topics and includes 48 distinct chart types. It evaluates both single-turn generation and multi-turn refinement and highlights deficiencies in current LLMs' ability to handle sophisticated visualization tasks. To address this performance gap, the authors introduce SynthVis-30K, a dataset of complex visualization code, and develop PlotCraftor, a code generation model that excels in complex data visualization with a small size. PlotCraftor demonstrates comparable performance to leading proprietary approaches on various benchmarks, showing over 50% improvement on challenging tasks. The benchmark, dataset, and code will be available for access on GitHub.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable profi- ciency in code generation. However, their ability to create complex visualiza- tions for scaled and structured data remains largely unevaluated and underdevel- oped. To address this gap, we introduce PlotCraft, a new benchmark featuring 1k challenging visualization tasks that cover a wide range of topics, such as fi- nance, scientific research, and sociology. The benchmark is structured around seven high-level visualization tasks and encompasses 48 distinct chart types. Cru- cially, it is the first to systematically evaluate both single-turn generation and multi-turn refinement across a diverse spectrum of task complexities. Our com- prehensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs on PlotCraft reveals obvious per- formance deficiencies in handling sophisticated visualization tasks. To bridge this performance gap, we develope SynthVis-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of complex visualization code synthesized via a collaborative agent frame- work. Building upon this dataset, we develope PlotCraftor, a novel code gener- ation model that achieves strong capabilities in complex data visualization with a remarkably small size. Across VisEval, PandasPlotBench, and our proposed PlotCraft, PlotCraftor shows performance comparable to that of leading propri- etary approaches. Especially, on hard task, Our model achieves over 50% per- formance improvement. We will release the benchmark, dataset, and code at https://github.com/Speakn0w/PlotCraft-Benchmark.

Summary: 

ProtoMBTI introduces a novel framework for personality recognition from text using prototype theory aligned with cognitive processes. The approach involves constructing a balanced corpus, augmenting it using an LLM-guided multi-dimensional approach, and fine-tuning a lightweight encoder for learning discriminative embeddings and standardizing personality prototypes. The model follows a retrieve--reuse--revise--retain cycle to aggregate prototype evidence, revise inconsistencies, and enrich the prototype library upon correct predictions. Results show improvements over baselines on MBTI dichotomies and the full 16-type task, with robust generalization across datasets. By aligning the inference process with psychological prototype reasoning, ProtoMBTI achieves enhanced accuracy, interpretability, and transfer in text-based personality modeling. <div>

Abstract: Personality recognition from text is typically cast as hard-label classification, which obscures the graded, prototype-like nature of human personality judgments. We present ProtoMBTI, a cognitively aligned framework for MBTI inference that operationalizes prototype theory within an LLM-based pipeline. First, we construct a balanced, quality-controlled corpus via LLM-guided multi-dimensional augmentation (semantic, linguistic, sentiment). Next, we LoRA-fine-tune a lightweight (<=2B) encoder to learn discriminative embeddings and to standardize a bank of personality prototypes. At inference, we retrieve top-k prototypes for a query post and perform a retrieve--reuse--revise--retain cycle: the model aggregates prototype evidence via prompt-based voting, revises when inconsistencies arise, and, upon correct prediction, retains the sample to continually enrich the prototype library. Across Kaggle and Pandora benchmarks, ProtoMBTI improves over baselines on both the four MBTI dichotomies and the full 16-type task, and exhibits robust cross-dataset generalization. Our results indicate that aligning the inference process with psychological prototype reasoning yields gains in accuracy, interpretability, and transfer for text-based personality modeling.

Summary: 
Interpretability studies in language models often focus on forward-looking representations of activations. However, current methods for understanding activations in language models are limited to specific concepts or tokens, despite their ability to perform longer time horizon tasks. This study introduces a framework of Residual Stream Decoders to probe model activations for paragraph-scale and document-scale plans. Testing various methods, the results show that information equivalent to 5+ tokens of future context can be decoded in small models. These findings pave the way for improved monitoring of language models and a better understanding of how they encode longer-term planning information. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Interpretability studies in language models often investigate forward-looking representations of activations. However, as language models become capable of doing ever longer time horizon tasks, methods for understanding activations often remain limited to testing specific concepts or tokens. We develop a framework of Residual Stream Decoders as a method of probing model activations for paragraph-scale and document-scale plans. We test several methods and find information can be decoded equivalent to 5+ tokens of future context in small models. These results lay the groundwork for better monitoring of language models and better understanding how they might encode longer-term planning information.

<div> next-token prediction, large language models, training performance, model performance, target-token selection strategies

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a novel approach to training large language models (LLMs) by predicting information-rich tokens during training instead of relying on next-token prediction (NTP). By focusing on predicting tokens that carry more valuable information, the proposed method aims to improve both training performance and model performance while keeping computational costs in check. The impact of this new strategy is analyzed across three different tasks for LLMs: arithmetic, multi-label classification of text, and natural-language generation. Through this research, a more principled approach to optimizing LLM training is presented, offering insights into the importance of target-token selection strategies. This work contributes to advancing the field by enhancing the theoretical understanding of LLM training methods and demonstrating the potential benefits of predicting information-rich tokens.

Abstract: Optimizing training performance in large language models (LLMs) remains an essential challenge, particularly in improving model performance while maintaining computational costs. This work challenges the conventional approach of training LLMs using next-token prediction (NTP), arguing that by predicting information-rich tokens during training, there is a more effective way to train LLMs. We investigate the impact of the proposed solution in three kinds of tasks for LLMs: arithmetic, multi-label classification of text, and natural-language generation. This work offers a principled approach to optimizing LLM training, advancing both model performance and theoretical understanding of the target-token selection strategies.

<div> persona consistency, large language models, dialogue, reinforcement learning, user roles

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used for simulating human users in various interactive settings. However, these models often struggle with maintaining persona consistency, leading to drift from assigned personas and inconsistent behavior. To address this issue, a unified framework is proposed to evaluate and enhance persona consistency in LLM-generated dialogue. Three automatic metrics are defined to capture different aspects of persona drift and validated against human annotations. Through multi-turn reinforcement learning, LLMs are fine-tuned for specific user roles, resulting in a significant reduction in inconsistency by over 55%. This approach leads to more coherent and faithful simulated users across roles, such as patients, students, and social chat partners. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human users in interactive settings such as therapy, education, and social role-play. While these simulations enable scalable training and evaluation of AI agents, off-the-shelf LLMs often drift from their assigned personas, contradict earlier statements, or abandon role-appropriate behavior. We introduce a unified framework for evaluating and improving persona consistency in LLM-generated dialogue. We define three automatic metrics: prompt-to-line consistency, line-to-line consistency, and Q&amp;A consistency, that capture different types of persona drift and validate each against human annotations. Using these metrics as reward signals, we apply multi-turn reinforcement learning to fine-tune LLMs for three user roles: a patient, a student, and a social chat partner. Our method reduces inconsistency by over 55%, resulting in more coherent and faithful simulated users.

Summary:
The article introduces AgentBnB, a browser-based adaptation of the Backdoors & Breaches cybersecurity game that incorporates large language model teammates and a Bloom-aligned retrieval-augmented copilot (C2D2). This system expands a curated corpus to provide targeted hints in factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive aspects, offering on-demand support during solo-player exercises. A pilot study with four graduate students revealed a preference for the agent-based version over traditional physical card decks, citing scalability as a key advantage. However, limitations such as sample size, single-player focus, and a ceiling effect in knowledge retention were noted. Future developments include multi-player modes, telemetry-driven coaching, and comparative studies with larger cohorts to further explore the effectiveness of large language model augmented tabletop exercises in cybersecurity training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Traditional cybersecurity tabletop exercises (TTXs) provide valuable training but are often scripted, resource-intensive, and difficult to scale. We introduce AgentBnB, a browser-based re-imagining of the Backdoors & Breaches game that integrates large language model teammates with a Bloom-aligned, retrieval-augmented copilot (C2D2). The system expands a curated corpus into factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive snippets, delivering on-demand, cognitively targeted hints. Prompt-engineered agents employ a scaffolding ladder that gradually fades as learner confidence grows. In a solo-player pilot with four graduate students, participants reported greater intention to use the agent-based version compared to the physical card deck and viewed it as more scalable, though a ceiling effect emerged on a simple knowledge quiz. Despite limitations of small sample size, single-player focus, and narrow corpus, these early findings suggest that large language model augmented TTXs can provide lightweight, repeatable practice without the logistical burden of traditional exercises. Planned extensions include multi-player modes, telemetry-driven coaching, and comparative studies with larger cohorts.

Summary:
IL-PCR is introduced as a unique corpus for developing models that address both statute retrieval and precedent retrieval tasks in the legal domain. The interdependence between these tasks is highlighted, as similar cases often reference similar statutes. Various baseline models, including lexical and semantic models, as well as ensemble models based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are tested on the tasks. An LLM-based re-ranking approach is proposed to leverage the relationship between statute and precedent retrieval, showcasing the best performance. The paper underscores the importance of considering the connection between statutes and precedents in developing more effective models for legal information retrieval.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying/retrieving relevant statutes and prior cases/precedents for a given legal situation are common tasks exercised by law practitioners. Researchers to date have addressed the two tasks independently, thus developing completely different datasets and models for each task; however, both retrieval tasks are inherently related, e.g., similar cases tend to cite similar statutes (due to similar factual situation). In this paper, we address this gap. We propose IL-PCR (Indian Legal corpus for Prior Case and Statute Retrieval), which is a unique corpus that provides a common testbed for developing models for both the tasks (Statute Retrieval and Precedent Retrieval) that can exploit the dependence between the two. We experiment extensively with several baseline models on the tasks, including lexical models, semantic models and ensemble based on GNNs. Further, to exploit the dependence between the two tasks, we develop an LLM-based re-ranking approach that gives the best performance.

Summary:
- Sign language translation faces challenges due to limited datasets, leading to the development of various techniques.
- The POSESTITCH-SLT pre-training scheme is inspired by linguistic-templates for sentence generation.
- A transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture outperforms prior methods using template-generated sentence pairs.
- Significant BLEU-4 score improvements are achieved on the How2Sign and iSign datasets, surpassing previous state-of-the-art techniques.
- Template-driven synthetic supervision proves effective in low-resource sign language translation scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language translation remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of large-scale, sentence-aligned datasets. Prior arts have focused on various feature extraction and architectural changes to support neural machine translation for sign languages. We propose POSESTITCH-SLT, a novel pre-training scheme that is inspired by linguistic-templates-based sentence generation technique. With translation comparison on two sign language datasets, How2Sign and iSign, we show that a simple transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture outperforms the prior art when considering template-generated sentence pairs in training. We achieve BLEU-4 score improvements from 1.97 to 4.56 on How2Sign and from 0.55 to 3.43 on iSign, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods for pose-based gloss-free translation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of template-driven synthetic supervision in low-resource sign language settings.

Summary:
Factorization Memory is introduced as an efficient RNN architecture that achieves comparable performance to Transformer models in short-context language modeling tasks. It demonstrates superior generalization in long-context scenarios by exploiting parallel computations during training while maintaining constant computational complexity during inference. A sparse formulation of Factorization Memory updates only a subset of recurrent states at each step, optimizing model efficiency while preserving strong performance. This is the first RNN architecture to successfully combine sparse memory activation with competitive performance across both short and long-context settings. An empirical analysis compares Factorization Memory to Transformer and Mamba-2 architectures, highlighting its effectiveness in various contexts.

Abstract: We propose Factorization Memory, an efficient recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that achieves performance comparable to Transformer models on short-context language modeling tasks while also demonstrating superior generalization in long-context scenarios. Our model builds upon Mamba-2, enabling Factorization Memory to exploit parallel computations during training while preserving constant computational and memory complexity during inference. To further optimize model efficiency and representational capacity, we develop a sparse formulation of Factorization Memory that updates only a subset of recurrent states at each step while preserving the strong performance of its dense counterpart. To our knowledge, this represents the first RNN architecture that successfully combines sparse memory activation with competitive performance across both short and long-context settings. This work provides a systematic empirical analysis of Factorization Memory in comparison to Transformer and Mamba-2 architectures.

<div> Keywords: causal language modeling, reversal invariance, pretraining objectives, direction-blind, temporal asymmetry

Summary:
The article discusses the concept of reversal invariance in causal language modeling (CLM), where the next-token prediction loss remains the same for both a corpus and its reversal. This implies that standard CLM pretraining is direction-blind, allowing models trained on reversed text to achieve similar performance to those trained on forward text. However, this symmetry may limit the ability of current pretraining objectives to capture directional dependencies inherent in human language. The authors suggest reexamining pretraining through the lens of temporal asymmetry to address this limitation. Future research should focus on developing loss functions and architectures that explicitly model the time asymmetry of language while maintaining standard language modeling capacity.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize a structural property of the causal (autoregressive) language modeling (CLM) objective: reversal invariance. Formally, the next-token prediction loss assigns identical likelihood to a corpus and its reversal, implying that standard CLM pretraining is direction-blind. This symmetry explains why models trained on reversed text can achieve comparable performance to those trained on forward text, despite the inherently time-asymmetric nature of human language and reasoning. We argue that this invariance represents a limitation of current pretraining objectives rather than a benign artifact. If natural language encodes directional dependencies - phonological, morphological, or causal - a symmetric objective may fail to capture them. We therefore propose viewing pretraining through the lens of temporal asymmetry, motivating future work on loss functions and architectures that explicitly model the arrow of language while retaining standard language modeling capacity.

- This study showcases both the potential and current limitations of utilizing LLMs for typologically informed linguistic analysis and documentation of low-resource languages.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces LingGym, a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs' capacity for meta-linguistic reasoning using Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) and grammatical descriptions extracted from 18 typologically diverse reference grammars. Unlike previous work that focuses on specific downstream tasks, we assess whether LLMs can generalize linguistic inference across low-resource languages and structures not seen during training. We present a controlled evaluation task: Word-Gloss Inference, in which the model must infer a missing word and gloss from context using varying levels of linguistic information (e.g., glosses, grammatical explanations, translations). Our results show that incorporating structured linguistic cues leads to consistent improvements in reasoning performance across all models. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of using LLMs for typologically informed linguistic analysis and low-resource language documentation.

Summary:
Socratic debugging involves guiding students to identify and fix programming bugs by leading them to contradict false programming beliefs. This process, known as Reasoning Trajectory (RT), helps students update their misconceptions through cognitive dissonance. This paper introduces the task of reasoning trajectory generation and provides a dataset with manually annotated debugging problems and RTs. LLM-based solutions are presented for generating RTs and guiding Socratic conversations based on them. An evaluation of frontier models shows high accuracy in generating correct reasoning trajectories and valid conversation turns. This approach offers a new method for instructors to help novice programmers understand and correct their misconceptions through guided reasoning processes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Socratic debugging, instructors guide students towards identifying and fixing a bug on their own, instead of providing the bug fix directly. Most novice programmer bugs are caused by programming misconceptions, namely false beliefs about a programming concept. In this context, Socratic debugging can be formulated as a guided Reasoning Trajectory (RT) leading to a statement about the program behavior that contradicts the bug-causing misconception. Upon reaching this statement, the ensuing cognitive dissonance leads the student to first identify and then update their false belief. In this paper, we introduce the task of reasoning trajectory generation, together with a dataset of debugging problems manually annotated with RTs. We then describe LLM-based solutions for generating RTs and Socratic conversations that are anchored on them. A large-scale LLM-as-judge evaluation shows that frontier models can generate up to 91% correct reasoning trajectories and 98.7% valid conversation turns.

<div> Keywords: AI-generated text, AIGT detectors, iteratively-paraphrased content, authorship obfuscation, plagiarism evasion

Summary: 
Detecting AI-generated text (AIGT) is challenging due to the effectiveness of iteratively-paraphrased content in evading detection systems. This study explores the reasons behind the success of iteratively-paraphrased text in bypassing AIGT detectors, highlighting the creation of an intermediate laundering region that poses significant challenges for detection. The intermediate laundering region involves semantic displacement while preserving generation patterns, leading to two attack categories: authorship obfuscation and plagiarism evasion. To address these vulnerabilities, the researchers introduce PADBen, a benchmark that evaluates detector robustness against both paraphrase attack scenarios. Evaluating 11 state-of-the-art detectors reveals a critical asymmetry in their performance, with detectors successfully identifying plagiarism evasion but failing for authorship obfuscation. The findings underscore the need for advancements in detection architectures to effectively handle the intermediate laundering region. The code implementation for PADBen is available at https://github.com/JonathanZha47/PadBen-Paraphrase-Attack-Benchmark. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors achieve over 90\% accuracy on direct LLM outputs, they fail catastrophically against iteratively-paraphrased content. We investigate why iteratively-paraphrased text -- itself AI-generated -- evades detection systems designed for AIGT identification. Through intrinsic mechanism analysis, we reveal that iterative paraphrasing creates an intermediate laundering region characterized by semantic displacement with preserved generation patterns, which brings up two attack categories: paraphrasing human-authored text (authorship obfuscation) and paraphrasing LLM-generated text (plagiarism evasion). To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce PADBen, the first benchmark systematically evaluating detector robustness against both paraphrase attack scenarios. PADBen comprises a five-type text taxonomy capturing the full trajectory from original content to deeply laundered text, and five progressive detection tasks across sentence-pair and single-sentence challenges. We evaluate 11 state-of-the-art detectors, revealing critical asymmetry: detectors successfully identify the plagiarism evasion problem but fail for the case of authorship obfuscation. Our findings demonstrate that current detection approaches cannot effectively handle the intermediate laundering region, necessitating fundamental advances in detection architectures beyond existing semantic and stylistic discrimination methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing promise in medical applications, but their ability to detect and correct errors in clinical texts -- a prerequisite for safe deployment -- remains under-evaluated, particularly beyond English. We introduce MedRECT, a cross-lingual benchmark (Japanese/English) that formulates medical error handling as three subtasks: error detection, error localization (sentence extraction), and error correction. MedRECT is built with a scalable, automated pipeline from the Japanese Medical Licensing Examinations (JMLE) and a curated English counterpart, yielding MedRECT-ja (663 texts) and MedRECT-en (458 texts) with comparable error/no-error balance. We evaluate 9 contemporary LLMs spanning proprietary, open-weight, and reasoning families. Key findings: (i) reasoning models substantially outperform standard architectures, with up to 13.5% relative improvement in error detection and 51.0% in sentence extraction; (ii) cross-lingual evaluation reveals 5-10% performance gaps from English to Japanese, with smaller disparities for reasoning models; (iii) targeted LoRA fine-tuning yields asymmetric improvements in error correction performance (Japanese: +0.078, English: +0.168) while preserving reasoning capabilities; and (iv) our fine-tuned model exceeds human expert performance on structured medical error correction tasks. To our knowledge, MedRECT is the first comprehensive cross-lingual benchmark for medical error correction, providing a reproducible framework and resources for developing safer medical LLMs across languages.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, they struggle with output diversity, often producing similar content repeatedly. Existing solutions like temperature scaling compromise output quality while increasing diversity. To address this, the authors propose Guide-to-Generation (G2), a plug-and-play method that enhances output diversity without affecting quality. G2 utilizes base generators and dual Guides to guide the generation process, encouraging diverse outputs based on the original query. Through comprehensive experiments, G2 has been shown to effectively improve output diversity while striking a balance between diversity and quality. This method presents a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in generating diverse and high-quality outputs. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse natural language processing tasks. However, these models exhibit a critical limitation in output diversity, often generating highly similar content across multiple attempts. This limitation significantly affects tasks requiring diverse outputs, from creative writing to reasoning. Existing solutions, like temperature scaling, enhance diversity by modifying probability distributions but compromise output quality. We propose Guide-to-Generation (G2), a training-free plug-and-play method that enhances output diversity while preserving generation quality. G2 employs a base generator alongside dual Guides, which guide the generation process through decoding-based interventions to encourage more diverse outputs conditioned on the original query. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that G2 effectively improves output diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between diversity and quality.

Abstract: Ongoing breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping search and recommendation platforms at their core. While this shift unlocks powerful new scientometric tools, it also exposes critical fairness and bias issues that could erode the integrity of the information ecosystem. Additionally, as LLMs become more integrated into web-based searches for scholarly tools, their ability to generate summarized research work based on memorized data introduces new dimensions to these challenges. The extent of memorization in LLMs can impact the accuracy and fairness of the co-authorship networks they produce, potentially reflecting and amplifying existing biases within the scientific community and across different regions. This study critically examines the impact of LLM memorization on the co-authorship networks. To this end, we assess memorization effects across three prominent models, DeepSeek R1, Llama 4 Scout, and Mixtral 8x7B, analyzing how memorization-driven outputs vary across academic disciplines and world regions. While our global analysis reveals a consistent bias favoring highly cited researchers, this pattern is not uniformly observed. Certain disciplines, such as Clinical Medicine, and regions, including parts of Africa, show more balanced representation, pointing to areas where LLM training data may reflect greater equity. These findings underscore both the risks and opportunities in deploying LLMs for scholarly discovery.

Abstract: The linguistic diversity of India poses significant machine translation challenges, especially for underrepresented tribal languages like Bhili, which lack high-quality linguistic resources. This paper addresses the gap by introducing Bhili-Hindi-English Parallel Corpus (BHEPC), the first and largest parallel corpus worldwide comprising 110,000 meticulously curated sentences across Bhili, Hindi, and English. The corpus was created with the assistance of expert human translators. BHEPC spans critical domains such as education, administration, and news, establishing a valuable benchmark for research in low resource machine translation. To establish a comprehensive Bhili Machine Translation benchmark, we evaluated a wide range of proprietary and open-source Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs) on bidirectional translation tasks between English/Hindi and Bhili. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned NLLB-200 distilled 600M variant model outperforms others, highlighting the potential of multilingual models in low resource scenarios. Furthermore, we investigated the generative translation capabilities of multilingual LLMs on BHEPC using in-context learning, assessing performance under cross-domain generalization and quantifying distributional divergence. This work bridges a critical resource gap and promotes inclusive natural language processing technologies for low-resource and marginalized languages globally.

This study is the first to consider the impact of dataset size on the efficacy of DP text rewriting techniques for both utility and privacy preservation. Through tests on large-scale datasets with varying sizes, including up to one million texts, the research focuses on quantifying the trade-off between privacy and utility as dataset size increases. The research highlights the importance of dataset size in evaluating DP text rewriting mechanisms and emphasizes the need for more rigorous evaluation procedures in DP Natural Language Processing (NLP). The findings suggest implications for the future of DP NLP at scale, emphasizing the significance of considering dataset size for effective privacy preservation and utility in text rewriting applications.

Abstract: Recent work in Differential Privacy with Natural Language Processing (DP NLP) has proposed numerous promising techniques in the form of text rewriting mechanisms. In the evaluation of these mechanisms, an often-ignored aspect is that of dataset size, or rather, the effect of dataset size on a mechanism's efficacy for utility and privacy preservation. In this work, we are the first to introduce this factor in the evaluation of DP text privatization, where we design utility and privacy tests on large-scale datasets with dynamic split sizes. We run these tests on datasets of varying size with up to one million texts, and we focus on quantifying the effect of increasing dataset size on the privacy-utility trade-off. Our findings reveal that dataset size plays an integral part in evaluating DP text rewriting mechanisms; additionally, these findings call for more rigorous evaluation procedures in DP NLP, as well as shed light on the future of DP NLP in practice and at scale.

<div> Tree-oriented MapReduce, long-context reasoning, hierarchical structure, recursive reasoning, logical coherence <br />
Summary:
The article introduces ToM, a novel Tree-oriented MapReduce framework designed for long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation and divide-and-conquer frameworks, ToM leverages the hierarchical structure of documents to improve logical coherence and capture long-range dependencies. By constructing a DocTree through hierarchical semantic parsing and implementing a bottom-up aggregation approach, ToM enables recursive reasoning. It generates rationales at child nodes in the Map step and aggregates them across sibling nodes in the Reduce step to resolve conflicts and reach consensus at parent nodes. Experimental results on 70B+ LLMs demonstrate that ToM outperforms existing methods in terms of logical coherence and long-context reasoning. The code for ToM is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), constrained by limited context windows, often face significant performance degradation when reasoning over long contexts. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves and reasons over chunks but frequently sacrifices logical coherence due to its reliance on similarity-based rankings. Similarly, divide-and-conquer frameworks (DCF) split documents into small chunks for independent reasoning and aggregation. While effective for local reasoning, DCF struggles to capture long-range dependencies and risks inducing conflicts by processing chunks in isolation. To overcome these limitations, we propose ToM, a novel Tree-oriented MapReduce framework for long-context reasoning. ToM leverages the inherent hierarchical structure of long documents (e.g., main headings and subheadings) by constructing a DocTree through hierarchical semantic parsing and performing bottom-up aggregation. Using a Tree MapReduce approach, ToM enables recursive reasoning: in the Map step, rationales are generated at child nodes; in the Reduce step, these rationales are aggregated across sibling nodes to resolve conflicts or reach consensus at parent nodes. Experimental results on 70B+ LLMs show that ToM significantly outperforms existing divide-and-conquer frameworks and retrieval-augmented generation methods, achieving better logical coherence and long-context reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/gjn12-31/ToM .

<div> retrieval-augmented generation, large language models, knowledge redundancy, dense retrieval, Zero-RAG <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Zero-RAG as a solution to address knowledge redundancy in Large Language Models (LLMs) by pruning redundant external corpus information. The Mastery-Score metric is proposed to identify and prune redundant knowledge in the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) corpus, leading to more efficient utilization of the LLM's internal knowledge. Zero-RAG also introduces Query Router and Noise-Tolerant Tuning to improve the LLM's utilization of internal knowledge after corpus pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that Zero-RAG can prune the Wikipedia corpus by 30% and accelerate the retrieval stage by 22% without compromising RAG's performance. <div>
arXiv:2511.00505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation has shown remarkable results to address Large Language Models' hallucinations, which usually uses a large external corpus to supplement knowledge to LLMs. However, with the development of LLMs, the internal knowledge of LLMs has expanded significantly, thus causing significant knowledge redundancy between the external corpus and LLMs. On the one hand, the indexing cost of dense retrieval is highly related to the corpus size and thus significant redundant knowledge intensifies the dense retrieval's workload. On the other hand, the redundant knowledge in the external corpus is not helpful to LLMs and our exploratory analysis shows that it instead hurts the RAG performance on those questions which the LLM can answer by itself. To address these issues, we propose Zero-RAG to tackle these challenges. Specifically, we first propose the Mastery-Score metric to identify redundant knowledge in the RAG corpus to prune it. After pruning, answers to "mastered" questions rely primarily on internal knowledge of the LLM. To better harness the internal capacity, we propose Query Router and Noise-Tolerant Tuning to avoid the irrelevant documents' distraction and thus further improve the LLM's utilization of internal knowledge with pruned corpus. Experimental results show that Zero-RAG prunes the Wikipedia corpus by 30\% and accelerates the retrieval stage by 22\%, without compromising RAG's performance.

Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly being explored to support healthcare delivery, particularly in resource-constrained settings such as rural Nepal. Large-scale conversational models typically rely on internet connectivity and cloud infrastructure, which may not be accessible in rural areas. In this study, we fine-tuned DialoGPT, a lightweight generative dialogue model that can operate offline, on a synthetically constructed dataset of doctor-patient interactions covering ten common diseases prevalent in rural Nepal, including common cold, seasonal fever, diarrhea, typhoid fever, gastritis, food poisoning, malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. Despite being trained on a limited, domain-specific dataset, the fine-tuned model produced coherent, contextually relevant, and medically appropriate responses, demonstrating an understanding of symptoms, disease context, and empathetic communication. These results highlight the adaptability of compact, offline-capable dialogue models and the effectiveness of targeted datasets for domain adaptation in low-resource healthcare environments, offering promising directions for future rural medical conversational AI.

<div> gender bias, language models, contextualized word embeddings, transformer-based models, mitigation approach <br />
Summary:
Gender bias in language models, particularly encoder-based transformer models, has become a concerning issue in natural language processing. This study focuses on prominent transformer architectures like BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT to analyze their susceptibility to gender bias in contextualized word embeddings. A new metric, MALoR, is introduced to measure bias based on model probabilities for masked tokens. The study proposes a mitigation strategy involving continued pre-training on a gender-balanced dataset created using Counterfactual Data Augmentation. Experiment results demonstrate significant reductions in gender bias scores across various pronoun pairs, such as "he-she" and "his-her." For example, in BERT-base, bias scores decreased from 1.27 to 0.08 for "he-she" and from 2.51 to 0.36 for "his-her" post-mitigation. The approach successfully diminishes gender bias without sacrificing model performance in downstream tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Gender bias in language models has gained increasing attention in the field of natural language processing. Encoder-based transformer models, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language tasks, have been shown to exhibit strong gender biases inherited from their training data. This paper investigates gender bias in contextualized word embeddings, a crucial component of transformer-based models. We focus on prominent architectures such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT to examine their vulnerability to gender bias. To quantify the degree of bias, we introduce a novel metric, MALoR, which assesses bias based on model probabilities for filling masked tokens. We further propose a mitigation approach involving continued pre-training on a gender-balanced dataset generated via Counterfactual Data Augmentation. Our experiments reveal significant reductions in gender bias scores across different pronoun pairs. For instance, in BERT-base, bias scores for "he-she" dropped from 1.27 to 0.08, and "his-her" from 2.51 to 0.36 following our mitigation approach. We also observed similar improvements across other models, with "male-female" bias decreasing from 1.82 to 0.10 in BERT-large. Our approach effectively reduces gender bias without compromising model performance on downstream tasks.

<div> word salad, Large Reasoning Models, self-awareness, token reduction, user experience 

Summary:
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often face inefficiencies due to the high cost of unnecessary output tokens, referred to as "word salad." LRMs show self-awareness when stuck in repetitive loops, with patterns in hidden states allowing for on-the-fly detection of word salad behavior. A new approach called WordSaladChopper (WSC) is introduced, which efficiently detects and eliminates redundant tokens, leading to significant length savings with minimal impact on quality. The WSC component offers a lightweight solution for improving user experience in LRM applications. The code for WSC is publicly available, making it accessible for implementation in various contexts requiring efficient token management. This method helps optimize LRMs by addressing the issue of word salad, enhancing the overall effectiveness and usability of reasoning models. <div>
arXiv:2511.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are often bottlenecked by the high cost of output tokens. We show that a significant portion of these tokens are useless self-repetitions - what we call "word salad" - that exhaust the decoding budget without adding value. Interestingly, we observe that LRMs are self-aware when trapped in these loops: the hidden states of <\n\n> tokens trailing each reasoning chunk exhibit patterns that allow us to detect word salad behavior on-the-fly via a single-layer linear classifier. Once detected, a simple chop appended by a straightforward regeneration prompt yields substantial length savings with minimal quality loss. Our work offers WordSaladChopper (WSC) - a lightweight, turnkey component for LRM that is minimally invasive to its reasoning trajectory by only removing semantically redundant tokens. Given its low overhead, strong savings, and the lack of semantic value of word salad tokens, we believe it is not too far-fetched to argue that WSC - or a similar component - is a must-have for all LRM applications with user experience in mind. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/wenyaxie023/WordSaladChopper.

arXiv:2511.00537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis using deep learning and pre-trained language models (PLMs) has gained significant traction due to their ability to capture rich contextual representations. However, existing approaches often underperform in scenarios involving nuanced emotional cues, domain shifts, and imbalanced sentiment distributions. We argue that these limitations stem from inadequate semantic grounding, poor generalization to diverse linguistic patterns, and biases toward dominant sentiment classes. To overcome these challenges, we propose CISEA-MRFE, a novel PLM-based framework integrating Contextual Instruction (CI), Semantic Enhancement Augmentation (SEA), and Multi-Refined Feature Extraction (MRFE). CI injects domain-aware directives to guide sentiment disambiguation; SEA improves robustness through sentiment-consistent paraphrastic augmentation; and MRFE combines a Scale-Adaptive Depthwise Encoder (SADE) for multi-scale feature specialization with an Emotion Evaluator Context Encoder (EECE) for affect-aware sequence modeling. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CISEA-MRFE consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving relative improvements in accuracy of up to 4.6% on IMDb, 6.5% on Yelp, 30.3% on Twitter, and 4.1% on Amazon. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our approach for sentiment classification across varied domains.

<div> intent inference, language models, attacks, defense, ISA<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to jailbreaking attacks and introduces a new attack method called ISA (Intent Shift Attack). ISA obfuscates the intent of attacks by transforming intent through a taxonomy of intent transformations, generating seemingly harmless prompts that can deceive LLMs. Experiments show that ISA significantly increases attack success rates compared to direct harmful prompts and can achieve near-perfect success rates when fine-tuning models on benign data using ISA templates. Existing defense methods are found to be inadequate against ISA, highlighting the need for more effective defenses. The research reveals fundamental challenges in intent inference for LLMs safety and emphasizes the importance of robust safety mechanisms in the face of evolving attack techniques. <div>
arXiv:2511.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks despite their impressive capabilities. Investigating these weaknesses is crucial for robust safety mechanisms. Existing attacks primarily distract LLMs by introducing additional context or adversarial tokens, leaving the core harmful intent unchanged. In this paper, we introduce ISA (Intent Shift Attack), which obfuscates LLMs about the intent of the attacks. More specifically, we establish a taxonomy of intent transformations and leverage them to generate attacks that may be misperceived by LLMs as benign requests for information. Unlike prior methods relying on complex tokens or lengthy context, our approach only needs minimal edits to the original request, and yields natural, human-readable, and seemingly harmless prompts. Extensive experiments on both open-source and commercial LLMs show that ISA achieves over 70% improvement in attack success rate compared to direct harmful prompts. More critically, fine-tuning models on only benign data reformulated with ISA templates elevates success rates to nearly 100%. For defense, we evaluate existing methods and demonstrate their inadequacy against ISA, while exploring both training-free and training-based mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal fundamental challenges in intent inference for LLMs safety and underscore the need for more effective defenses. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/ISA.

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized natural language processing, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating remarkable scalability. However, their memory demands, particularly due to maintaining full context in memory, pose significant challenges for inference. In this paper, we present FlashEVA, an efficient implementation of EVA (Efficient Attention via Control Variates), and demonstrate how to finetune transformers to adapt to FlashEVA attention. Our method enables fine-tuning of Transformer models with as few as 1.5B tokens while preserving effectiveness across various downstream tasks. Notably, FlashEVA achieves up to 6.7x higher throughput and 5x lower peak GPU memory usage during inference compared to standard Transformer implementations. Despite these improvements, we observe limitations in retrieval-focused tasks. Our implementation offers control over the trade-off between throughput and accuracy through adjustable hyperparameters, providing flexibility for diverse use cases. This work represents a significant step towards more efficient and adaptable Transformer-based models for inference.

Summary:
OpenSIR is a self-play framework designed for large language models to enhance reasoning abilities without the need for annotated datasets. Through alternating teacher and student roles, the model learns to generate and solve novel problems independently, optimizing for both difficulty and diversity. By rewarding challenging problems that explore distinct concepts, OpenSIR enables open-ended mathematical discovery. The framework significantly improves instruction models, such as Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Gemma-2-2B-Instruct, on various datasets. Analyses show that OpenSIR achieves open-ended learning by co-evolving teacher-student roles, adapting difficulty levels, and promoting diverse exploration, leading to autonomous progression from basic to advanced mathematics. The framework showcases the potential for large language models to advance their reasoning capabilities through self-play and independent problem-solving.

arXiv:2511.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning through reinforcement learning rely on annotated datasets for verifiable rewards, which may limit models' ability to surpass human-level performance. While self-play offers a promising alternative, existing approaches depend on external verifiers or cannot learn open-endedly. We present Open-Ended Self-Improving Reasoner (OpenSIR), a self-play framework where an LLM learns to generate and solve novel problems by alternating teacher and student roles without external supervision. To generate novel problems, OpenSIR optimises for both difficulty and diversity, rewarding problems that challenge appropriately while exploring distinct concepts, enabling open-ended mathematical discovery. Starting from a single trivial seed problem, OpenSIR substantially improves instruction models: Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct advances from 73.9 to 78.3 on GSM8K, and from 28.8 to 34.4 on College Math, while Gemma-2-2B-Instruct rises from 38.5 to 58.7 on GSM8K. Our analyses reveal that OpenSIR achieves open-ended learning through co-evolving teacher-student roles that adaptively calibrate difficulty and drive diverse exploration, progressing autonomously from basic to advanced mathematics.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Speculative decoding has gained popularity for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by using a draft-then-verify method. However, it faces challenges due to autoregressive dependency and token misalignment. To overcome these barriers, SpecDiff-2 introduces discrete diffusion for drafting and aligns it with autoregressive verifiers. The framework achieves impressive speed improvements across various benchmarks, increasing tokens-per-second by an average of +55% compared to previous methods. SpecDiff-2 sets a new state-of-the-art in reasoning, coding, and mathematical tasks, delivering up to a 5.5x speed-up over standard decoding without sacrificing accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2511.00606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has become the standard approach for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. It exploits a lossless draft-then-verify procedure to circumvent the latency of autoregressive decoding, achieving impressive speed-ups. Yet, current speculative decoding approaches remain limited by two fundamental bottlenecks: (1) the autoregressive dependency during drafting which limits parallelism, and (2) frequent rejections of draft tokens caused by misalignment between the draft and verify models. This paper proposes SpecDiff-2, a novel framework to jointly address these two bottlenecks. It leverages discrete diffusion as a non-autoregressive drafter to address bottleneck (1) and develops novel techniques to calibrate discrete diffusion drafters with autoregressive verifiers, addressing bottleneck (2). Experimental results across a comprehensive benchmark suite show that SpecDiff-2 achieves a new state-of-the-art across reasoning, coding, and mathematical benchmarks, improving tokens-per-second by up to an average of +55% over previous baselines and obtaining up to 5.5x average speed-up over standard decoding, without any loss of accuracy.

<div> Keywords: uncertainty quantification, language models, probability, alignment, theoretical distributions 

Summary: 
Model certainty is crucial for large language models in decision-support applications, but assessing token-level probabilities may not accurately reflect theoretical distributions. A study using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-Chat examined model responses to probabilistic prompts, finding perfect accuracy in scenario constraints but divergence in token-level probabilities from theoretical distributions. This highlights the need for improved uncertainty quantification methods in probabilistic scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for ensuring trustworthy downstream use of large language models, especially when they are deployed in decision-support and other knowledge-intensive applications. Model certainty can be estimated from token logits, with derived probability and entropy values offering insight into performance on the prompt task. However, this approach may be inadequate for probabilistic scenarios, where the probabilities of token outputs are expected to align with the theoretical probabilities of the possible outcomes. We investigate the relationship between token certainty and alignment with theoretical probability distributions in well-defined probabilistic scenarios. Using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-Chat, we evaluate model responses to ten prompts involving probability (e.g., roll a six-sided die), both with and without explicit probability cues in the prompt (e.g., roll a fair six-sided die). We measure two dimensions: (1) response validity with respect to scenario constraints, and (2) alignment between token-level output probabilities and theoretical probabilities. Our results indicate that, while both models achieve perfect in-domain response accuracy across all prompt scenarios, their token-level probability and entropy values consistently diverge from the corresponding theoretical distributions.

Summary: 
This research delves into the evolution of the detective archetype in French detective fiction using computational analysis. Through the use of quantitative methods and character-level embeddings, a supervised model successfully captures the essence of the detective archetype spanning 150 years of literature, showcasing a shift from a secondary role to the central character and "reasoning machine" of classical detective stories. As French detective fiction evolved post-World War II, influenced by the hardboiled tradition, the archetype became more intricate, facing challenges of social violence and moral ambiguity within the genre. This study sheds light on the evolution of the detective figure, highlighting its journey from a mere character to a multi-faceted central figure in French detective narratives.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the evolution of the detective archetype in French detective fiction through computational analysis. Using quantitative methods and character-level embeddings, we show that a supervised model is able to capture the unity of the detective archetype across 150 years of literature, from M. Lecoq (1866) to Commissaire Adamsberg (2017). Building on this finding, the study demonstrates how the detective figure evolves from a secondary narrative role to become the central character and the "reasoning machine" of the classical detective story. In the aftermath of the Second World War, with the importation of the hardboiled tradition into France, the archetype becomes more complex, navigating the genre's turn toward social violence and moral ambiguity.

<div> geography, culture, history, multilingual LLMs, XNationQA <br />
Summary: 
The study introduces XNationQA to assess the cultural literacy of multilingual models, covering 49,280 questions on geography, culture, and history of nine countries in seven languages. Eight multilingual LLMs were evaluated on XNationQA using novel transference metrics, revealing discrepancies in their knowledge of culturally specific facts across languages. Models show better performance in Western languages but struggle with knowledge transfer, especially in open-source models. The models often display more knowledge in English than in the dominant language of the culture being represented. This highlights the gap in evaluating multilingual models' understanding of diverse geographical and cultural information, indicating a need for more inclusive and regionally diverse benchmarks in question-answering tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Most multilingual question-answering benchmarks, while covering a diverse pool of languages, do not factor in regional diversity in the information they capture and tend to be Western-centric. This introduces a significant gap in fairly evaluating multilingual models' comprehension of factual information from diverse geographical locations. To address this, we introduce XNationQA for investigating the cultural literacy of multilingual LLMs. XNationQA encompasses a total of 49,280 questions on the geography, culture, and history of nine countries, presented in seven languages. We benchmark eight standard multilingual LLMs on XNationQA and evaluate them using two novel transference metrics. Our analyses uncover a considerable discrepancy in the models' accessibility to culturally specific facts across languages. Notably, we often find that a model demonstrates greater knowledge of cultural information in English than in the dominant language of the respective culture. The models exhibit better performance in Western languages, although this does not necessarily translate to being more literate for Western countries, which is counterintuitive. Furthermore, we observe that models have a very limited ability to transfer knowledge across languages, particularly evident in open-source models.

<div> Keywords: large language models, safety alignment, jailbreak attacks, cross-lingual evaluation, language-aware benchmarks

Summary:<br />
Large language models (LLMs) undergo safety alignment procedures post-training, but recent research has demonstrated vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks, bypassing these safety measures. This study conducts the first comprehensive multilingual assessment of jailbreaks and defenses across ten languages using six LLMs on HarmBench and AdvBench datasets. Two types of jailbreak attacks are evaluated: logical-expression-based and adversarial-prompt-based. Results show varying levels of attack success and defense robustness across languages, with high-resource languages appearing safer under standard queries but more susceptible to adversarial ones. Simple defenses prove effective but are reliant on the language and LLM being used. These findings highlight the importance of developing language-aware and cross-lingual safety benchmarks for LLMs to enhance their overall security posture.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) undergo safety alignment after training and tuning, yet recent work shows that safety can be bypassed through jailbreak attacks. While many jailbreaks and defenses exist, their cross-lingual generalization remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic multilingual evaluation of jailbreaks and defenses across ten languages--spanning high-, medium-, and low-resource languages--using six LLMs on HarmBench and AdvBench. We assess two jailbreak types: logical-expression-based and adversarial-prompt-based. For both types, attack success and defense robustness vary across languages: high-resource languages are safer under standard queries but more vulnerable to adversarial ones. Simple defenses can be effective, but are language- and model-dependent. These findings call for language-aware and cross-lingual safety benchmarks for LLMs.

<div> Keywords: Native Sparse Attention, long-context modeling, Latent Attention, common-sense reasoning, long-text understanding

Summary: 
In this study, the researchers analyze Native Sparse Attention (NSA) and propose enhancements to improve long-context modeling. They suggest alternating between local and global attention across layers to better capture long-range dependencies and boost performance on tasks involving long sequences. Additionally, they introduce Latent Attention to further refine NSA, with the sliding-window branch enhanced by Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and the compression and selective branches adopting Group-head Latent Attention (GLA). These modifications not only reduce KV-cache memory by 50% compared to NSA but also improve the model's abilities in common-sense reasoning and understanding long texts. Experimental results on models ranging from 340M to 1.3B parameters trained on 15B and 100B tokens demonstrate that the proposed method can match or surpass both full attention and native sparse attention in common-sense reasoning and long-context understanding tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of Native Sparse Attention (NSA) and propose targeted improvements that enhance long-context modeling. A key insight is that alternating between local (sliding-window) and global (compression, selective) attention across layers, rather than using fixed patterns, enables more effective propagation of long-range dependencies and substantially boosts performance on long-sequence tasks. Meanwhile, we further refine NSA's branches with Latent Attention that the sliding-window branch is enhanced with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) while compression and selective branches adopt Group-head Latent Attention (GLA). These changes reduce KV-cache memory by 50\% versus NSA while improving the model's common-sense reasoning and long-text understanding capabilities. Experiments on models from 340M to 1.3B parameters (trained on 15B and 100B tokens) show our method matches or exceeds full attention and native sparse attention in both common-sense reasoning and long-context understanding tasks.

<div> Keywords: language models, social biases, debiasing methods, TriCon-Fair, contrastive learning<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper addresses the issue of social biases in large language models and proposes TriCon-Fair, a contrastive learning framework that aims to eliminate positive-negative coupling in existing debiasing methods. By combining triplet and language modeling terms in a decoupled loss function, TriCon-Fair assigns biases explicitly, ensuring improvements for one group do not inadvertently harm another. This approach reduces discriminatory output while maintaining strong downstream performance in sensitive NLP applications. Experimental results show that TriCon-Fair outperforms existing debiasing baselines in reducing social bias. The framework optimizes a language modeling objective to preserve general capability, highlighting its practical and ethical implications for the use of language models in various applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing utilization of large language models raises significant concerns about the propagation of social biases, which may result in harmful and unfair outcomes. However, existing debiasing methods treat the biased and unbiased samples independently, thus ignoring their mutual relationship. This oversight enables a hidden negative-positive coupling, where improvements for one group inadvertently compromise the other, allowing residual social bias to persist. In this paper, we introduce TriCon-Fair, a contrastive learning framework that employs a decoupled loss that combines triplet and language modeling terms to eliminate positive-negative coupling. Our TriCon-Fair assigns each anchor an explicitly biased negative and an unbiased positive, decoupling the push-pull dynamics and avoiding positive-negative coupling, and jointly optimizes a language modeling (LM) objective to preserve general capability. Experimental results demonstrate that TriCon-Fair reduces discriminatory output beyond existing debiasing baselines while maintaining strong downstream performance. This suggests that our proposed TriCon-Fair offers a practical and ethical solution for sensitive NLP applications.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Step-by-step reasoning has become a standard approach for large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks. While this paradigm has proven effective, it raises a fundamental question: How can we verify that an LLM's reasoning is accurately grounded in knowledge? To address this question, we introduce a novel evaluation suite that systematically assesses the knowledge grounding of intermediate reasoning. Our framework comprises three key components. (1) Principal Knowledge Collection, a large-scale repository of atomic knowledge essential for reasoning. Based on the collection, we propose (2) knowledge-grounded evaluation metrics designed to measure how well models recall and apply prerequisite knowledge in reasoning. These metrics are computed by our (3) evaluator LLM, a lightweight model optimized for cost-effective and reliable metric computation. Our evaluation suite demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in identifying missing or misapplied knowledge elements, providing crucial insights for uncovering fundamental reasoning deficiencies in LLMs. Beyond evaluation, we demonstrate how these metrics can be integrated into preference optimization, showcasing further applications of knowledge-grounded evaluation.

Summary:
ColMate is a novel document retrieval model that incorporates multimodal representation learning techniques. It introduces unique features such as an OCR-based pretraining objective, self-supervised masked contrastive learning, and a late interaction scoring mechanism. These innovations lead to significant improvements over existing retrieval models on the ViDoRe V2 benchmark, showcasing enhanced generalization capabilities. By combining these advanced strategies, ColMate demonstrates superior performance in capturing the nuances of multimodal document structures and visual characteristics. The model's ability to bridge the gap between traditional text-only retrieval methods and modern multimodal representation learning makes it a valuable addition to the field of document retrieval. <div>
arXiv:2511.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has proven practical when models require specialized knowledge or access to the latest data. However, existing methods for multimodal document retrieval often replicate techniques developed for text-only retrieval, whether in how they encode documents, define training objectives, or compute similarity scores. To address these limitations, we present ColMate, a document retrieval model that bridges the gap between multimodal representation learning and document retrieval. ColMate utilizes a novel OCR-based pretraining objective, a self-supervised masked contrastive learning objective, and a late interaction scoring mechanism more relevant to multimodal document structures and visual characteristics. ColMate obtains 3.61% improvements over existing retrieval models on the ViDoRe V2 benchmark, demonstrating stronger generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks.

Summary:<br />
The study evaluates the performance of two large language models (LLMs) in generating explanations and guidance for patients in medical diagnostic scenarios. Understandability is assessed using readability metrics, while empathy is measured through LLM-as-a-Judge ratings compared to human evaluations. The results show that LLMs adapt their explanations based on socio-demographic variables and patient conditions. However, they tend to produce overly complex content and exhibit biased affective empathy, leading to unequal accessibility and support for patients. This highlights the importance of systematic calibration to ensure that LLMs provide equitable communication with patients. The code and data from the study are publicly available on GitHub for further research and validation purposes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinicians in diagnostic communication by generating explanations and guidance for patients. Yet their ability to produce outputs that are both understandable and empathetic remains uncertain. We evaluate two leading LLMs on medical diagnostic scenarios, assessing understandability using readability metrics as a proxy and empathy through LLM-as-a-Judge ratings compared to human evaluations. The results indicate that LLMs adapt explanations to socio-demographic variables and patient conditions. However, they also generate overly complex content and display biased affective empathy, leading to uneven accessibility and support. These patterns underscore the need for systematic calibration to ensure equitable patient communication. The code and data are released: https://github.com/Jeffateth/Biased_Oracle

Summary: 
This study investigates the cultural reasoning and self-assessment capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across seven major Indian languages using a multilingual riddle dataset. Five LLMs were evaluated under various prompting strategies, with Gemini 2.5 Pro showing the best overall performance. However, the few-shot methods only resulted in marginal improvements, and accuracy varied significantly across languages. The self-evaluation experiment revealed an inverse correlation between a model's initial accuracy and its ability to identify its own mistakes. The top-performing models like Gemini 2.5 Pro exhibited overconfidence, while lower-performing models such as LLaMA 4 Scout demonstrated higher self-awareness. These findings emphasize the gaps in multilingual reasoning and underscore the importance of developing models that can reason effectively while recognizing their own limitations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The extent to which large language models (LLMs) can perform culturally grounded reasoning across non-English languages remains underexplored. This paper examines the reasoning and self-assessment abilities of LLMs across seven major Indian languages-Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu. We introduce a multilingual riddle dataset combining traditional riddles with context-reconstructed variants and evaluate five LLMs-Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Mistral-Saba, LLaMA 4 Scout, and LLaMA 4 Maverick-under seven prompting strategies. In the first stage, we assess riddle-solving performance and find that while Gemini 2.5 Pro performs best overall, few-shot methods yield only marginal gains, and accuracy varies notably across languages. In the second stage, we conduct a self-evaluation experiment to measure reasoning consistency. The results reveal a key finding: a model's initial accuracy is inversely correlated with its ability to identify its own mistakes. Top-performing models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro are overconfident (4.34% True Negative Rate), whereas lower-performing models like LLaMA 4 Scout are substantially more self-aware (42.09% True Negative Rate). These results point to clear gaps in multilingual reasoning and highlight the need for models that not only reason effectively but also recognize their own limitations.

<div> Keywords: machine-generated text detection, easy-to-hard enhancement framework, inexact learning, supervisor, detector

Summary:
The article addresses the limitations of existing machine-generated text (MGT) detection methods that rely on "golden standard" labels, which may contain boundary ambiguity. It introduces an easy-to-hard enhancement framework to provide reliable supervision in the presence of inexact learning conditions. This framework utilizes a supervisor targeting simpler longer-text detection tasks to enhance the performance of a more advanced detector. By structurally integrating the detector into the supervisor, the framework optimizes the supervisor as a lower performance bound for the detector, ultimately approximating the true labels. Extensive experiments show the framework's effectiveness in various practical scenarios, including cross-LLM, cross-domain, mixed text, and paraphrase attacks. The code for the framework is available on GitHub at https://github.com/tmlr-group/Easy2Hard. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Existing MGT detection methods face challenges due to inexact labels and boundary ambiguity.
- An easy-to-hard enhancement framework is proposed for reliable supervision under inexact learning conditions.
- The framework utilizes a supervisor targeting simple longer-text detection tasks to enhance a more advanced detector.
- By structurally incorporating the detector into the supervisor, the framework optimizes the supervisor as a lower performance bound for the detector.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness across various practical scenarios, confirming its significant detection capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2511.00988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing machine-generated text (MGT) detection methods implicitly assume labels as the "golden standard". However, we reveal boundary ambiguity in MGT detection, implying that traditional training paradigms are inexact. Moreover, limitations of human cognition and the superintelligence of detectors make inexact learning widespread and inevitable. To this end, we propose an easy-to-hard enhancement framework to provide reliable supervision under such inexact conditions. Distinct from knowledge distillation, our framework employs an easy supervisor targeting relatively simple longer-text detection tasks (despite weaker capabilities), to enhance the more challenging target detector. Firstly, longer texts targeted by supervisors theoretically alleviate the impact of inexact labels, laying the foundation for reliable supervision. Secondly, by structurally incorporating the detector into the supervisor, we theoretically model the supervisor as a lower performance bound for the detector. Thus, optimizing the supervisor indirectly optimizes the detector, ultimately approximating the underlying "golden" labels. Extensive experiments across diverse practical scenarios, including cross-LLM, cross-domain, mixed text, and paraphrase attacks, demonstrate the framework's significant detection effectiveness.

Summary: 
The article introduces MARS-SQL, a multi-agent framework for translating natural language to SQL. The framework consists of three specialized agents: Grounding Agent, Generation Agent, and Validation Agent. The Generation Agent is trained using interactive reinforcement learning, allowing for dynamic reasoning and self-correction through a Think-Act-Observe loop. At inference time, multiple interaction trajectories are explored to find the optimal solution. The Validation Agent selects the best trajectory by modeling verification as a next-token prediction task. The structured workflow combines interactive RL for generation with generative modeling for verification, resulting in robust and accurate SQL generation. Experiments demonstrate that MARS-SQL achieves high Execution Accuracy on benchmark datasets. The code for MARS-SQL is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Translating natural language to SQL remains difficult for complex queries. Such queries often need environmental interaction and self-correction. To address this, we introduce MARS-SQL, a novel multi-agent framework that combines principled task decomposition and interactive reinforcement learning (RL). Our system comprises three specialized agents: a Grounding Agent for schema linking, a Generation Agent for query generation, and a Validation Agent for final selection. The core of our framework is the Generation agent, which is trained via a multi-turn RL policy. Adopting a ReAct-style Think-Act-Observe loop, the agent iteratively generates thoughts, executes SQL actions against a live database, and revises its strategy based on execution feedback, enabling dynamic, stateful reasoning and self-correction. At inference time, we generate multiple interaction trajectories to explore diverse reasoning paths. The Validation agent, then selects the optimal trajectory by modeling verification as a next-token prediction task and choosing the solution with the highest generation probability. This structured workflow pipelines specialized agents. It combines interactive RL for generation with generative modeling for verification. The approach proves highly effective for robust and accurate SQL generation. Experiments show that MARS-SQL achieves state-of-the-art Execution Accuracy of 77.84% on the BIRD dev set and 89.75% on the Spider test set. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangHaolin0526/MARS-SQL.

Summary: <br />
The study introduces IF-CRITIC, a model designed to assess the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow constraints in instructions efficiently and reliably. It uses a checklist generator to break down instructions into constraints and collects training data through a multi-stage critique filtering mechanism. IF-CRITIC is trained using constraint-level preference optimization. Experiments show that IF-CRITIC outperforms strong LLM-as-a-Judge baselines like Deepseek-R1 and o4-mini in evaluating instruction following. The scalable reward signals provided by IF-CRITIC enable LLMs to optimize instruction following with reduced computational overhead. <div>
arXiv:2511.01014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction following is a fundamental ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring their generated outputs to follow multiple constraints imposed in input instructions. Numerous studies have attempted to enhance this ability through preference optimization or reinforcement learning based on reward signals from LLM-as-a-Judge. However, existing evaluation models for instruction following still possess many deficiencies, such as substantial costs and unreliable assessments. To this end, we propose IF-CRITIC, an LLM critic that can provide efficient and reliable assessments of constraint following in the instructions. We first develop a checklist generator to decompose instructions and generate constraint checklists. With the assistance of the checklists, we collect high-quality critique training data through a multi-stage critique filtering mechanism and employ a constraint-level preference optimization method to train IF-CRITIC. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the evaluation performance of IF-CRITIC can beat strong LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, including Deepseek-R1 and o4-mini. With the scalable reward signals provided by IF-CRITIC, LLMs can achieve substantial performance gains in instruction-following optimization under lower computational overhead compared to strong LLM critic baselines.

Summary:
Prompt-R1 is an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) by facilitating collaboration between a small-scale LLM and a large-scale LLM. The framework replaces user interaction with a multi-turn prompt interaction process, where the small-scale LLM generates prompts and the large-scale LLM performs complex reasoning.

Abstract: Recently, advanced large language models (LLMs) have emerged at an increasingly rapid pace. However, when faced with complex problems, most users are often unable to provide accurate and effective prompts to interact with LLMs, thus limiting the performance of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose Prompt-R1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that uses a small-scale LLM to collaborate with large-scale LLMs, replacing user interaction to solve problems better. This collaboration is cast as a multi-turn prompt interaction, where the small-scale LLM thinks and generates prompts, and the large-scale LLM performs complex reasoning. A dual-constrained reward is designed to optimize for correctness, generation quality, and reasoning accuracy. Prompt-R1 provides a plug-and-play framework that supports both inference and training with various large-scale LLMs. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that Prompt-R1 significantly outperforms baseline models across tasks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming the sciences, yet general conversational AI systems often generate unverified "hallucinations" undermining scientific rigor. We present OceanAI, a conversational platform that integrates the natural-language fluency of open-source large language models (LLMs) with real-time, parameterized access to authoritative oceanographic data streams hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Each query such as "What was Boston Harbor's highest water level in 2024?" triggers real-time API calls that identify, parse, and synthesize relevant datasets into reproducible natural-language responses and data visualizations. In a blind comparison with three widely used AI chat-interface products, only OceanAI produced NOAA-sourced values with original data references; others either declined to answer or provided unsupported results. Designed for extensibility, OceanAI connects to multiple NOAA data products and variables, supporting applications in marine hazard forecasting, ecosystem assessment, and water-quality monitoring. By grounding outputs and verifiable observations, OceanAI advances transparency, reproducibility, and trust, offering a scalable framework for AI-enabled decision support within the oceans.

At 30 trillion tokens, this is likely the largest generally available multilingual collection of LLM pre-training data. At 30 trillion tokens, this is likely the largest generally available multilingual collection of LLM pre-training data. These datasets are derived from web crawls from different sources and accompanied with a complete, open-source pipeline for document selection from web archives, text extraction from HTML, language identification for noisy texts, exact and near-deduplication, annotation with, among others, register labels, text quality estimates, and personally identifiable information; and final selection and filtering. We report on data quality probes through contrastive and analytical statistics, through manual inspection of samples for 24 languages, and through end-to-end evaluation of various language model architectures trained on this data. For multilingual LLM evaluation, we provide a comprehensive collection of benchmarks for nine European languages, with special emphasis on natively created tasks, mechanisms to mitigate prompt sensitivity, and refined normalization and aggregation of scores. Additionally, we train and evaluate a family of 57 monolingual encoder-decoder models, as well as a handful of monolingual GPT-like reference models. Besides the monolingual data and models, we also present a very large collection of parallel texts automatically mined from this data, together with a novel parallel corpus synthesized via machine translation.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently exploded in popularity, often matching or outperforming human abilities on many tasks. One of the key factors in training LLMs is the availability and curation of high-quality data. Data quality is especially crucial for under-represented languages, where high-quality corpora are scarce. In this work we study the characteristics and coverage of Romanian pretraining corpora and we examine how they differ from English data. By training a lightweight multitask model on carefully LLM-annotated Romanian texts, we are able to analyze and perform multi-level filtering (e.g., educational value, topic, format) to generate high-quality pretraining datasets. Our experiments show noteworthy trends in the topics present in Romanian and English data, while also proving the effectiveness of filtering data through improved LLM pretraining performance across multiple benchmarks.

Summary:
TSVer is a new benchmark dataset for fact verification focusing on temporal and numerical reasoning with time-series evidence. It contains 287 real-world claims from 38 fact-checking organizations and 400 curated time series. Each claim is annotated with time frames, verdicts, and justifications for the verdicts. Through a multi-step annotation process, high-quality annotations were achieved with an inter-annotator agreement of kappa=0.745 on verdicts. A baseline for verifying claims against time-series evidence was developed, highlighting the challenges even for state-of-the-art reasoning models. The baseline achieved a 63.37 accuracy score on verdicts and an Ev2R score of 48.63 on verdict justifications. This dataset and evaluation demonstrate the importance of temporal and numerical reasoning in fact-checking and provide a valuable resource for future research in this area.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reasoning over temporal and numerical data, such as time series, is a crucial aspect of fact-checking. While many systems have recently been developed to handle this form of evidence, their evaluation remains limited by existing datasets, which often lack structured evidence, provide insufficient justifications for verdicts, or rely on synthetic claims. In this paper, we introduce TSVer, a new benchmark dataset for fact verification focusing on temporal and numerical reasoning with time-series evidence. TSVer contains 287 real-world claims sourced from 38 fact-checking organizations and a curated database of 400 time series covering diverse domains. Each claim is annotated with time frames across all pertinent time series, along with a verdict and justifications reflecting how the evidence is used to reach the verdict. Using an LLM-assisted multi-step annotation process, we improve the quality of our annotations and achieve an inter-annotator agreement of kappa=0.745 on verdicts. We also develop a baseline for verifying claims against time-series evidence and show that even the state-of-the-art reasoning models like Gemini-2.5-Pro are challenged by time series, achieving a 63.37 accuracy score on verdicts and an Ev2R score of 48.63 on verdict justifications.

Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with agent-based reasoning frameworks are being explored for autonomous decision-making in microservice remediation. The study introduces MicroRemed, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in generating Ansible playbooks for system recovery directly from diagnosis reports. Current approaches rely on human-crafted prompts, but the proposed ThinkRemed framework mimics the reasoning of Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) to improve remediation performance. Experimental results demonstrate the challenges MicroRemed presents to current LLMs and the effectiveness of ThinkRemed in iterative reasoning and system reflection. The benchmark code is available on GitHub for further research and development.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with agent-based reasoning frameworks have recently shown strong potential for autonomous decision-making and system-level operations. One promising yet underexplored direction is microservice remediation, where the goal is to automatically recover faulty microservice systems. Existing approaches, however, still rely on human-crafted prompts from Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), with LLMs merely converting textual instructions into executable code. To advance research in this area, we introduce MicroRemed, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in end-to-end microservice remediation, where models must directly generate executable Ansible playbooks from diagnosis reports to restore system functionality. We further propose ThinkRemed, a multi-agent framework that emulates the reflective and perceptive reasoning of SREs. Experimental results show that MicroRemed presents substantial challenges to current LLMs, while ThinkRemed improves end-to-end remediation performance through iterative reasoning and system reflection. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/LLM4AIOps/MicroRemed.

<div> Keywords: salespeople, optimal stopping, language model, artificial intelligence, salesforce efficiency

Summary: 
Salespeople often face the dilemma of when to persist in a conversation or move on to the next lead. This study focuses on outbound sales, where time is limited, and failure is common. The researchers developed a stopping agent using a language model to determine the optimal time to end a conversation. The agent reduced time spent on failed calls by 54% while maintaining sales, leading to a potential increase in expected sales by up to 37%. By analyzing linguistic cues that drive salespeople's decisions, the study found that they tend to overemphasize certain expressions of disinterest and underestimate call failure risk. This suggests that human decision-making in sales conversations may be limited by cognitive constraints. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence algorithms to improve salesforce efficiency by optimizing decision-making in dynamic screening scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Salespeople frequently face the dynamic screening decision of whether to persist in a conversation or abandon it to pursue the next lead. Yet, little is known about how these decisions are made, whether they are efficient, or how to improve them. We study these decisions in the context of high-volume outbound sales where leads are ample, but time is scarce and failure is common. We formalize the dynamic screening decision as an optimal stopping problem and develop a generative language model-based sequential decision agent - a stopping agent - that learns whether and when to quit conversations by imitating a retrospectively-inferred optimal stopping policy. Our approach handles high-dimensional textual states, scales to large language models, and works with both open-source and proprietary language models. When applied to calls from a large European telecommunications firm, our stopping agent reduces the time spent on failed calls by 54% while preserving nearly all sales; reallocating the time saved increases expected sales by up to 37%. Upon examining the linguistic cues that drive salespeople's quitting decisions, we find that they tend to overweight a few salient expressions of consumer disinterest and mispredict call failure risk, suggesting cognitive bounds on their ability to make real-time conversational decisions. Our findings highlight the potential of artificial intelligence algorithms to correct cognitively-bounded human decisions and improve salesforce efficiency.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed for open-ended communication, yet most bias evaluations still rely on English, classification-style tasks. We introduce DebateBias-8K, a new multilingual, debate-style benchmark designed to reveal how narrative bias appears in realistic generative settings. Our dataset includes 8,400 structured debate prompts spanning four sensitive domains: women's rights, socioeconomic development, terrorism, and religion, across seven languages ranging from high-resource (English, Chinese) to low-resource (Swahili, Nigerian Pidgin). Using four flagship models (GPT-4o, Claude 3, DeepSeek, and LLaMA 3), we generate and automatically classify over 100,000 responses. Results show that all models reproduce entrenched stereotypes despite safety alignment: Arabs are overwhelmingly linked to terrorism and religion (>=95%), Africans to socioeconomic "backwardness" (up to <=77%), and Western groups are consistently framed as modern or progressive. Biases grow sharply in lower-resource languages, revealing that alignment trained primarily in English does not generalize globally. Our findings highlight a persistent divide in multilingual fairness: current alignment methods reduce explicit toxicity but fail to prevent biased outputs in open-ended contexts. We release our DebateBias-8K benchmark and analysis framework to support the next generation of multilingual bias evaluation and safer, culturally inclusive model alignment.

<title>ZoFia: Zero-Shot Fake News Detection with Entity-Guided Retrieval and Multi-LLM Interaction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news threatens social stability and public trust, rendering its detection an imperative research priority. Although large language models (LLMs) excel at numerous natural language processing tasks with their remarkable contextual understanding and extensive prior knowledge, the time-bounded knowledge coverage and tendency for generating hallucination content reduce their reliability when handling fast-evolving news streams. Furthermore, models trained on existing static datasets also often lack the generalization needed for emerging news topics. To address these challenges, we propose ZoFia, a novel two-stage zero-shot fake news detection framework. First, we introduce Hierarchical Salience to quantify the importance of entities in the news content, and propose the SC-MMR algorithm to effectively select an informative and diverse set of keywords that serve as queries for retrieving up-to-date external evidence. Subsequently, a multi LLM interactive system, in which each agent assumes a distinct role, performs multi-view collaborative analysis and adversarial debate over the news text and its related information, and finally produces an interpretable and robust judgment. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that ZoFia obviously outperforms existing zero-shot baselines and most of few-shot methods. Our codes will be open-sourced to facilitate related communities.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) offers a label-free paradigm for adapting models using only synthetic signals at inference, but its success hinges on constructing reliable learning signals. Standard approaches such as majority voting often collapse to spurious yet popular answers. We introduce Self-Harmony, a framework built on a simple intuition: the correct answer should remain stable across both an original question and its paraphrase. Self-Harmony operationalizes this by employing a single model in two complementary roles: a Solver to produce answers and a Reframer to rephrase the input. Based on this, we further propose a pseudo-label method: instead of majority voting, it aggregates answer frequencies across these original and reframed views using the harmonic mean. This is a process that naturally selects for solutions stable under reframing, thereby avoiding the common trap of favoring view-dependent, spurious answers. Crucially, this requires no human supervision or auxiliary models. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, Self-Harmony achieves state-of-the-art results at the label-free test-time setting, ranking first in 28 of 30 settings across multiple methods. Beyond accuracy, it demonstrates unprecedented robustness, with zero training failures in all experiments, underscoring its stability and reliability.

Abstract: Detecting machine-generated text (MGT) has emerged as a critical challenge, driven by the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) capable of producing highly realistic, human-like content. However, the performance of current approaches often degrades significantly under domain shift. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework designed to capture both domain-specific and domain-general MGT patterns through a two-stage Disentangled mixturE-of-ExpeRts (DEER) architecture. First, we introduce a disentangled mixture-of-experts module, in which domain-specific experts learn fine-grained, domain-local distinctions between human and machine-generated text, while shared experts extract transferable, cross-domain features. Second, to mitigate the practical limitation of unavailable domain labels during inference, we design a reinforcement learning-based routing mechanism that dynamically selects the appropriate experts for each input instance, effectively bridging the train-inference gap caused by domain uncertainty. Extensive experiments on five in-domain and five out-of-domain benchmark datasets demonstrate that DEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average F1-score improvements of 1.39% and 5.32% on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets respectively, along with accuracy gains of 1.35% and 3.61% respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of both disentangled expert specialization and adaptive routing to model performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of domain specificity on abstractive summarisation of Arabic financial texts using large language models (LLMs). We introduce AraFinNews, the largest publicly available Arabic financial news dataset to date, comprising 212,500 article--headline pairs spanning nearly a decade of reporting from October 2015 to July 2025. Designed as the Arabic equivalent of major English summarisation corpora such as CNN/DailyMail, AraFinNews provides a robust benchmark for evaluating domain-specific language understanding and generation in financial contexts. Using this resource, we evaluate transformer-based models -- including mT5, AraT5, and the domain-adapted FinAraT5 -- to examine how financial-domain pretraining influences factual accuracy, numerical reliability, and stylistic alignment with professional reporting. Experimental results show that domain-adapted models generate more faithful and coherent summaries, particularly in handling quantitative and entity-centric information. The findings highlight the importance of domain-specific adaptation for improving factual consistency and narrative fluency in Arabic financial summarisation. The dataset is freely available for non-commercial research at https://github.com/ArabicNLP-UK/AraFinNews.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as an effective technique to accelerate large language model (LLM) inference without compromising output quality. However, the achievable speedup largely depends on the effectiveness of the drafting model. While model-based methods like EAGLE-2 are accurate but costly, retrieval-enhanced methods like SAM-Decoding rely on heuristic switching strategies that often trigger unnecessary retrievals. To address this, we propose ReSpec (\textbf{Re}trieval-enhanced \textbf{Spe}culative Decoding), a novel framework that transforms heuristic drafter switching into adaptive decision-making. ReSpec features three core innovations: 1) An \textbf{entropy-guided adaptive trigger} quantifies contextual predictability to initiate retrieval only when uncertainty is low, avoiding costly low-quality speculations. 2) A \textbf{feedback-driven candidate selection} leverages historical feedback to organize multiple high-quality candidates for parallel verification, maximizing retrieval utility. 3) A source-aware \textbf{relaxed verification strategy} applies strict checks to model-generated drafts while using a relaxed verification for retrieved drafts, achieving a better balance between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments on Spec-Bench demonstrate that ReSpec achieves state-of-the-art acceleration,outperforming EAGLE-2 and SAM-Decoding by over $33\%$ and $25\%$, respectively, while maintaining output quality.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI models, their deployment across diverse tasks has become increasingly widespread. A notable emerging application is leveraging AI models to assist in reviewing scientific papers. However, recent reports have revealed that some papers contain hidden, injected prompts designed to manipulate AI reviewers into providing overly favorable evaluations. In this work, we present an early systematic investigation into this emerging threat. We propose two classes of attacks: (1) static attack, which employs a fixed injection prompt, and (2) iterative attack, which optimizes the injection prompt against a simulated reviewer model to maximize its effectiveness. Both attacks achieve striking performance, frequently inducing full evaluation scores when targeting frontier AI reviewers. Furthermore, we show that these attacks are robust across various settings. To counter this threat, we explore a simple detection-based defense. While it substantially reduces the attack success rate, we demonstrate that an adaptive attacker can partially circumvent this defense. Our findings underscore the need for greater attention and rigorous safeguards against prompt-injection threats in AI-assisted peer review.

Abstract: In emergency situations, every second counts. The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in time-sensitive, low or zero-connectivity environments remains limited. Current models are computationally intensive and unsuitable for low-tier devices often used by first responders or civilians. A major barrier to developing lightweight, domain-specific solutions is the lack of high-quality datasets tailored to first aid and emergency response. To address this gap, we introduce FirstAidQA, a synthetic dataset containing 5,500 high-quality question answer pairs that encompass a wide range of first aid and emergency response scenarios. The dataset was generated using a Large Language Model, ChatGPT-4o-mini, with prompt-based in-context learning, using texts from the Vital First Aid Book (2019). We applied preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, contextual chunking, and filtering, followed by human validation to ensure accuracy, safety, and practical relevance of the QA pairs. FirstAidQA is designed to support instruction-tuning and fine-tuning of LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs), enabling faster, more reliable, and offline-capable systems for emergency settings. We publicly release the dataset to advance research on safety-critical and resource-constrained AI applications in first aid and emergency response. The dataset is available on Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/i-am-mushfiq/FirstAidQA.

arXiv:2511.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G technology enables mobile Internet access for billions of users. Answering expert-level questions about 5G specifications requires navigating thousands of pages of cross-referenced standards that evolve across releases. Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, including telecom-specific approaches, rely on semantic similarity and cannot reliably resolve cross-references or reason about specification evolution. We present DeepSpecs, a RAG system enhanced by structural and temporal reasoning via three metadata-rich databases: SpecDB (clause-aligned specification text), ChangeDB (line-level version diffs), and TDocDB (standardization meeting documents). DeepSpecs explicitly resolves cross-references by recursively retrieving referenced clauses through metadata lookup, and traces specification evolution by mining changes and linking them to Change Requests that document design rationale. We curate two 5G QA datasets: 573 expert-annotated real-world questions from practitioner forums and educational resources, and 350 evolution-focused questions derived from approved Change Requests. Across multiple LLM backends, DeepSpecs outperforms base models and state-of-the-art telecom RAG systems; ablations confirm that explicit cross-reference resolution and evolution-aware retrieval substantially improve answer quality, underscoring the value of modeling the structural and temporal properties of 5G standards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with integrated search tools show strong promise in open-domain question answering (QA), yet they often struggle to produce complete answer set to complex questions such as Which actor from the film Heat won at least one Academy Award?, which requires (1) distinguishing between multiple films sharing the same title and (2) reasoning across a large set of actors to gather and integrate evidence. Existing QA benchmarks rarely evaluate both challenges jointly. To address this, we introduce DeepAmbigQAGen, an automatic data generation pipeline that constructs QA tasks grounded in text corpora and linked knowledge graph, generating natural and verifiable questions that systematically embed name ambiguity and multi-step reasoning. Based on this, we build DeepAmbigQA, a dataset of 3,600 questions requiring multi-hop reasoning and half of them explicit name ambiguity resolving. Experiments reveal that, even state-of-the-art GPT-5 show incomplete answers, achieving only 0.13 exact match on ambiguous questions and 0.21 on non-ambiguous questions. These findings highlight the need for more robust QA systems aimed at information gathering and answer completeness.

Abstract: Recently, the demand for small and efficient reasoning models to support real-world applications has driven the development of knowledge distillation techniques that balance reasoning performance and inference speed. In this paper, we further extend the DistilQwen model family, initialized from the Qwen models, by introducing four model series specifically designed to meet industrial requirements. The distilled model collection comprises: (1) slow-thinking models, optimized for reasoning tasks that require high accuracy; (2) two series of adaptive-thinking models, which dynamically adjust reasoning strategies based on input tasks to maximize efficiency across diverse scenarios; and (3) distilled reward models, which enable further reinforcement learning of reasoning models using distilled knowledge. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate both high inference efficiency and strong reasoning performance for these models, as well as the practical utility of distilled reward models. We further show that these models support industry practitioners by providing scalable training and inference functionalities on the Alibaba Cloud PAI (Platform for Artificial Intelligence) platform.

<title>PrefixNLI: Detecting Factual Inconsistencies as Soon as They Arise</title>

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) models have been used in various ways to improve the factuality of LLM outputs. This is typically done by applying an NLI model to judge whether the model output is entailed from the supposed evidence, triggering some corrective actions, such as beam reranking at inference time or RL rewards during training. While NLI models are trained to detect factual inconsistencies over complete sentences, decisions in the common autoregressive generation architecture are made for each evolving text prefix, during decoding. Addressing this setting, we generalize the entailment detection task to apply over arbitrary text prefixes, and suggest its utility for improving generation faithfulness. Providing suitable evaluation and training datasets for this task, we train MiniTruePrefixes, a novel specialized model that better detects factual inconsistencies over text prefixes, outperforming comparable baseline NLI models by 5-14 F1 points in prefix-level entailment. We further demonstrate that integrating MiniTruePrefixes into a controlled decoding framework substantially improves factual consistency in abstractive summarization. When guided by MiniTruePrefixes, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct matches the faithfulness and runtime of the 8B model from the same model family, while using only half the memory.

Abstract: Increasingly, more and more people are turning to large language models (LLMs) for healthcare advice and consultation, making it important to gauge the efficacy and accuracy of the responses of LLMs to such queries. While there are pre-existing medical benchmarks literature which seeks to accomplish this very task, these benchmarks are almost universally in English, which has led to a notable gap in existing literature pertaining to multilingual LLM evaluation. Within this work, we seek to aid in addressing this gap with Cancer-Myth-Indic, an Indic language benchmark built by translating a 500-item subset of Cancer-Myth, sampled evenly across its original categories, into five under-served but widely used languages from the subcontinent (500 per language; 2,500 translated items total). Native-speaker translators followed a style guide for preserving implicit presuppositions in translation; items feature false presuppositions relating to cancer. We evaluate several popular LLMs under this presupposition stress.

Abstract: The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has been accompanied by an equally rapid increase of benchmarks used to assess them. However, due to both improved model competence resulting from scaling and novel training advances as well as likely many of these datasets being included in pre or post training data, results become saturated, driving a continuous need for new and more challenging replacements. In this paper, we discuss whether surpassing a benchmark truly demonstrates reasoning ability or are we simply tracking numbers divorced from the capabilities we claim to measure? We present an investigation focused on three model families, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, and how their reasoning capabilities across different benchmarks evolve over the years. We also analyze performance trends over the years across different reasoning tasks and discuss the current situation of benchmarking and remaining challenges. By offering a comprehensive overview of benchmarks and reasoning tasks, our work aims to serve as a first reference to ground future research in reasoning evaluation and model development.

<title>Confounding Factors in Relating Model Performance to Morphology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extent to which individual language characteristics influence tokenization and language modeling is an open question. Differences in morphological systems have been suggested as both unimportant and crucial to consider (Cotterell et al., 2018; Gerz et al., 2018a; Park et al., 2021, inter alia). We argue this conflicting evidence is due to confounding factors in experimental setups, making it hard to compare results and draw conclusions. We identify confounding factors in analyses trying to answer the question of whether, and how, morphology relates to language modeling. Next, we re-assess three hypotheses by Arnett & Bergen (2025) for why modeling agglutinative languages results in higher perplexities than fusional languages: they look at morphological alignment of tokenization, tokenization efficiency, and dataset size. We show that each conclusion includes confounding factors. Finally, we introduce token bigram metrics as an intrinsic way to predict the difficulty of causal language modeling, and find that they are gradient proxies for morphological complexity that do not require expert annotation. Ultimately, we outline necessities to reliably answer whether, and how, morphology relates to language modeling.

<title>RAGSmith: A Framework for Finding the Optimal Composition of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Methods Across Datasets</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01386</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) quality depends on many interacting choices across retrieval, ranking, augmentation, prompting, and generation, so optimizing modules in isolation is brittle. We introduce RAGSmith, a modular framework that treats RAG design as an end-to-end architecture search over nine technique families and 46{,}080 feasible pipeline configurations. A genetic search optimizes a scalar objective that jointly aggregates retrieval metrics (recall@k, mAP, nDCG, MRR) and generation metrics (LLM-Judge and semantic similarity). We evaluate on six Wikipedia-derived domains (Mathematics, Law, Finance, Medicine, Defense Industry, Computer Science), each with 100 questions spanning factual, interpretation, and long-answer types. RAGSmith finds configurations that consistently outperform naive RAG baseline by +3.8\% on average (range +1.2\% to +6.9\% across domains), with gains up to +12.5\% in retrieval and +7.5\% in generation. The search typically explores $\approx 0.2\%$ of the space ($\sim 100$ candidates) and discovers a robust backbone -- vector retrieval plus post-generation reflection/revision -- augmented by domain-dependent choices in expansion, reranking, augmentation, and prompt reordering; passage compression is never selected. Improvement magnitude correlates with question type, with larger gains on factual/long-answer mixes than interpretation-heavy sets. These results provide practical, domain-aware guidance for assembling effective RAG systems and demonstrate the utility of evolutionary search for full-pipeline optimization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on question answering often relies on static benchmarks that reward memorization and understate the role of retrieval, failing to capture the dynamic nature of world knowledge. We present LiveSearchBench, an automated pipeline for constructing retrieval-dependent benchmarks from recent knowledge updates. Our method computes deltas between successive Wikidata snapshots, filters candidate triples for quality, and synthesizes natural-language questions at three levels of reasoning difficulty, each guaranteed to admit a unique, verifiable answer through SPARQL validation. The pipeline is fully automated, scalable across time, and minimizes human intervention, enabling continual regeneration of temporally grounded benchmarks. Experiments show a pronounced performance drop when models confront facts that post-date pretraining, with the gap most salient on multi-hop queries. Retrieval augmented methods and larger, instruction-tuned models provide partial gains but fail to close this recency gap. By design, LiveSearchBench shifts evaluation from static memorization toward tasks that require up-to-date retrieval and reasoning, offering a foundation for systematic, long-term assessment of LLMs under evolving knowledge.

<title>"Don't Teach Minerva": Guiding LLMs Through Complex Syntax for Faithful Latin Translation with RAG</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translating a morphology-rich, low-resource language like Latin poses significant challenges. This paper introduces a reproducible draft-based refinement pipeline that elevates open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to a performance level statistically comparable to top-tier proprietary systems. Our method first uses a fine-tuned NLLB-1.3B model to generate a high-quality, structurally faithful draft. A zero-shot LLM (Llama-3.3 or Qwen3) then polishes this draft, a process that can be further enhanced by augmenting the context with retrieved out-context examples (RAG). We demonstrate the robustness of this approach on two distinct benchmarks: a standard in-domain test set (Rosenthal, 2023) and a new, challenging out-of-domain (OOD) set of 12th-century Latin letters (2025). Our central finding is that this open-source RAG system achieves performance statistically comparable to the GPT-5 baseline, without any task-specific LLM fine-tuning. We release the pipeline, the Chartres OOD set, and evaluation scripts and models to facilitate replicability and further research.

<title>BARD: budget-aware reasoning distillation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01470</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation effectively transfers reasoning capability to smaller language models, the reasoning process often remains redundant and computational budget uncontrollable, leading to inefficient resource usage. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{Budget-Aware Reasoning Distillation (BARD)}, a novel framework that simultaneously distills reasoning capability and enables fine-grained control over the reasoning length. BARD uses the thinking budget as a user-specified control signal, allowing the model to dynamically balance reasoning performance and computational efficiency. To achieve this concept, BARD introduces a two-phase training regimen. The first phase, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on teacher-generated long CoT data compressed to various budget levels, bootstrapping the model's understanding of budget constraints. The second phase leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) from a reward signal in consideration of reasoning performance and budget fidelity simultaneously. Incorporating the two-phase regimen is crucial to avoiding policy degradation and ensuring that both objectives are optimized jointly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method empowers an 8B student model to achieve strong performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks (\textit{AIME24, AIME25, GPQA}) while providing precise and adaptive control over its reasoning length across a wide range of budgets.

<title>Towards Consistent Detection of Cognitive Distortions: LLM-Based Annotation and Dataset-Agnostic Evaluation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-based automated Cognitive Distortion detection is a challenging task due to its subjective nature, with low agreement scores observed even among expert human annotators, leading to unreliable annotations. We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as consistent and reliable annotators, and propose that multiple independent LLM runs can reveal stable labeling patterns despite the inherent subjectivity of the task. Furthermore, to fairly compare models trained on datasets with different characteristics, we introduce a dataset-agnostic evaluation framework using Cohen's kappa as an effect size measure. This methodology allows for fair cross-dataset and cross-study comparisons where traditional metrics like F1 score fall short. Our results show that GPT-4 can produce consistent annotations (Fleiss's Kappa = 0.78), resulting in improved test set performance for models trained on these annotations compared to those trained on human-labeled data. Our findings suggest that LLMs can offer a scalable and internally consistent alternative for generating training data that supports strong downstream performance in subjective NLP tasks.

arXiv:2511.01490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As synthetic data becomes widely used in language model development, understanding its impact on model behavior is crucial. This paper investigates the impact of the diversity of sources of synthetic data on fine-tuned large language models. We focus on three key dimensions: distribution collapse, adversarial robustness, and self-preference bias. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning models on synthetic data from diverse sources can mitigate distribution collapse, preserving the breadth of the output distribution and the diversity of the output text. Furthermore, while both human and synthetic fine-tuning data can remove safeguards, the latter preserves higher output quality, thus making outputs potentially more usable and dangerous. Finally, fine-tuning reduces self-preference bias, with human data being the most effective, followed by multi-source synthetic data.

Abstract: Toxic language in Bengali remains prevalent, especially in online environments, with few effective precautions against it. Although text detoxification has seen progress in high-resource languages, Bengali remains underexplored due to limited resources. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for Bengali text detoxification that combines Pareto class-optimized large language models (LLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate detoxified sentences. To support this effort, we construct BanglaNirTox, an artificially generated parallel corpus of 68,041 toxic Bengali sentences with class-wise toxicity labels, reasonings, and detoxified paraphrases, using Pareto-optimized LLMs evaluated on random samples. The resulting BanglaNirTox dataset is used to fine-tune language models to produce better detoxified versions of Bengali sentences. Our findings show that Pareto-optimized LLMs with CoT prompting significantly enhance the quality and consistency of Bengali text detoxification.

Abstract: Multiple-choice cloze questions are commonly used to assess linguistic proficiency and comprehension. However, generating high-quality distractors remains challenging, as existing methods often lack adaptability and control over difficulty levels, and the absence of difficulty-annotated datasets further hinders progress. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for generating distractors with controllable difficulty by leveraging both data augmentation and a multitask learning strategy. First, to create a high-quality, difficulty-annotated dataset, we introduce a two-way distractor generation process in order to produce diverse and plausible distractors. These candidates are subsequently refined through filtering and then categorized by difficulty using an ensemble QA system. Second, this newly created dataset is leveraged to train a difficulty-controllable generation model via multitask learning. The framework includes carefully designed auxiliary tasks that enhance the model's semantic understanding of distractors and its ability to estimate their difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates high-quality distractors across difficulty levels and substantially outperforms GPT-4o in aligning distractor difficulty with human perception.

Abstract: Math anxiety poses significant challenges for university psychology students, affecting their career choices and overall well-being. This study employs a framework based on behavioural forma mentis networks (i.e. cognitive models that map how individuals structure their associative knowledge and emotional perceptions of concepts) to explore individual and group differences in the perception and association of concepts related to math and anxiety. We conducted 4 experiments involving psychology undergraduates from 2 samples (n1 = 70, n2 = 57) compared against GPT-simulated students (GPT-3.5: n2 = 300; GPT-4o: n4 = 300). Experiments 1, 2, and 3 employ individual-level network features to predict psychometric scores for math anxiety and its facets (observational, social and evaluational) from the Math Anxiety Scale. Experiment 4 focuses on group-level perceptions extracted from human students, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o's networks. Results indicate that, in students, positive valence ratings and higher network degree for "anxiety", together with negative ratings for "math", can predict higher total and evaluative math anxiety. In contrast, these models do not work on GPT-based data because of differences in simulated networks and psychometric scores compared to humans. These results were also reconciled with differences found in the ways that high/low subgroups of simulated and real students framed semantically and emotionally STEM concepts. High math-anxiety students collectively framed "anxiety" in an emotionally polarising way, absent in the negative perception of low math-anxiety students. "Science" was rated positively, but contrasted against the negative perception of "math". These findings underscore the importance of understanding concept perception and associations in managing students' math anxiety.

<title>ECO Decoding: Entropy-Based Control for Controllability and Fluency in Controllable Dialogue Generation</title>

arXiv:2511.01568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable Dialogue Generation (CDG) enables chatbots to generate responses with desired attributes, and weighted decoding methods have achieved significant success in the CDG task. However, using a fixed constant value to manage the bias of attribute probabilities makes it challenging to find an ideal control strength that satisfies both controllability and fluency. To address this issue, we propose ECO decoding (Entropy-based COntrol), which dynamically adjusts the control strength at each generation step according to the model's entropy in both the language model and attribute classifier probability distributions. Experiments on the DailyDialog and MultiWOZ datasets demonstrate that ECO decoding consistently improves controllability while maintaining fluency and grammaticality, outperforming prior decoding methods across various models and settings. Furthermore, ECO decoding alleviates probability interpolation issues in multi-attribute generation and consequently demonstrates strong performance in both single and multi-attribute scenarios.

arXiv:2511.01615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linguistic errors are not merely deviations from normative grammar; they offer a unique window into the cognitive architecture of language and expose the current limitations of artificial systems that seek to replicate them. This project proposes an interdisciplinary study of linguistic errors produced by native Spanish speakers, with the aim of analyzing how current large language models (LLM) interpret, reproduce, or correct them. The research integrates three core perspectives: theoretical linguistics, to classify and understand the nature of the errors; neurolinguistics, to contextualize them within real-time language processing in the brain; and natural language processing (NLP), to evaluate their interpretation against linguistic errors. A purpose-built corpus of authentic errors of native Spanish (+500) will serve as the foundation for empirical analysis. These errors will be tested against AI models such as GPT or Gemini to assess their interpretative accuracy and their ability to generalize patterns of human linguistic behavior. The project contributes not only to the understanding of Spanish as a native language but also to the development of NLP systems that are more cognitively informed and capable of engaging with the imperfect, variable, and often ambiguous nature of real human language.

Abstract: ParlaSpeech is a collection of spoken parliamentary corpora currently spanning four Slavic languages - Croatian, Czech, Polish and Serbian - all together 6 thousand hours in size. The corpora were built in an automatic fashion from the ParlaMint transcripts and their corresponding metadata, which were aligned to the speech recordings of each corresponding parliament. In this release of the dataset, each of the corpora is significantly enriched with various automatic annotation layers. The textual modality of all four corpora has been enriched with linguistic annotations and sentiment predictions. Similar to that, their spoken modality has been automatically enriched with occurrences of filled pauses, the most frequent disfluency in typical speech. Two out of the four languages have been additionally enriched with detailed word- and grapheme-level alignments, and the automatic annotation of the position of primary stress in multisyllabic words. With these enrichments, the usefulness of the underlying corpora has been drastically increased for downstream research across multiple disciplines, which we showcase through an analysis of acoustic correlates of sentiment. All the corpora are made available for download in JSONL and TextGrid formats, as well as for search through a concordancer.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture for Energy Efficiency (EE) Question Answering. First, the system automatically extracts a Knowledge Graph (KG) from guidance and regulatory documents in the energy field. Then, the generated graph is navigated and reasoned upon to provide users with accurate answers in multiple languages. We implement a human-based validation using the RAGAs framework properties, a validation dataset comprising 101 question-answer pairs, and domain experts. Results confirm the potential of this architecture and identify its strengths and weaknesses. Validation results show how the system correctly answers in about three out of four of the cases (75.2 +- 2.7%), with higher results on questions related to more general EE answers (up to 81.0 +- 4.1%), and featuring promising multilingual abilities (4.4% accuracy loss due to translation).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to specialized, high-stakes domains like engineering, which demands rigorous evaluation of their complex reasoning capabilities. While current benchmarks assess language understanding, factual recall, mathematics or code generation, none capture the integrative reasoning central to engineering where scientific principles, quantitative modeling and practical constraints must converge. To address this gap, we introduce EngChain, a benchmark for verifiable multi-step engineering problem-solving. EngChain contains 90 problems spanning three engineering branches, organized into 9 domains and 20 distinct areas. The problems are generated from symbolic templates with a high degree of randomization to ensure diversity and eliminate the risk of contamination. With this benchmark, we move beyond final answer accuracy with a two-stage evaluation: we first quantitatively verify the numerical and semantic validity of each reasoning step and then introduce LLM-As-A-Judge, an automated system to qualitatively categorize the identified reasoning errors.

Abstract: We introduce SeaLLMs-Audio, the first large audio-language model (LALM) tailored for multiple Southeast Asian (SEA) languages-Indonesian (id), Thai (th), and Vietnamese (vi)-alongside English (en) and Chinese (zh). Trained on a large-scale audio corpus, SeaLLMs-Audio exhibits strong performance across diverse audio-centric tasks, spanning fine-grained audio understanding and voice-based interaction. Its key features include: 1) Multilingual: the model primarily supports 5 languages, namely Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese, English, and Chinese; 2) Multimodal: the model accepts flexible input modalities, including audio only, text only, as well as audio with text; 3) Multi-task: the model supports a wide range of tasks, including audio analysis tasks such as Audio Captioning, Automatic Speech Recognition, Speech-to-Text Translation, Speech Emotion Recognition, Speech Question Answering, and Speech Summarization. It also enables voice-based dialogue, including answering factual, mathematical, and general knowledge queries. As a significant step towards advancing audio LLMs in Southeast Asia, we expect SeaLLMs-Audio to benefit both the regional research community and industry. To automate LALM evaluation for Southeast Asia, we introduce SeaBench-Audio, a benchmark spanning multiple tasks. Experiments show that SeaLLMs-Audio achieves competitive performance compared with other LALMs on SEA languages.

Abstract: The character of the "AI assistant" persona generated by modern chatbot large language models influences both surface-level behavior and apparent values, beliefs, and ethics. These all affect interaction quality, perceived intelligence, and alignment with both developer and user intentions. The shaping of this persona, known as character training, is a critical component of industry post-training, yet remains effectively unstudied in the academic literature. We introduce the first open implementation of character training, leveraging Constitutional AI and a new data pipeline using synthetic introspective data to shape the assistant persona in a more effective and controlled manner than alternatives such as constraining system prompts or activation steering. Specifically, we fine-tune three popular open-weights models using 11 example personas, such as humorous, deeply caring, or even malevolent. To track the effects of our approach, we introduce a method which analyzes revealed preferences, uncovering clear and holistic changes in character. We find these changes are more robust to adversarial prompting than the above two alternatives, while also leading to more coherent and realistic generations. Finally, we demonstrate this fine-tuning has little to no effect on general capabilities as measured by common benchmarks. We describe and open-source our full post-training method, the implementation of which can be found at https://github.com/maiush/OpenCharacterTraining.

Abstract: Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) describe how Large Language Models (LLMs) make decisions, drawing on both external Context Knowledge (CK) and Parametric Knowledge (PK) stored in model weights. Understanding their interaction is key to assessing the grounding of NLEs, yet it remains underexplored. Prior work has largely examined only single-step generation, typically the final answer, and has modelled PK and CK interaction only as a binary choice in a rank-1 subspace. This overlooks richer forms of interaction, such as complementary or supportive knowledge. We propose a novel rank-2 projection subspace that disentangles PK and CK contributions more accurately and use it for the first multi-step analysis of knowledge interactions across longer NLE sequences. Experiments on four QA datasets and three open-weight instruction-tuned LLMs show that diverse knowledge interactions are poorly represented in a rank-1 subspace but are effectively captured in our rank-2 formulation. Our multi-step analysis reveals that hallucinated NLEs align strongly with the PK direction, context-faithful ones balance PK and CK, and Chain-of-Thought prompting for NLEs shifts generated NLEs toward CK by reducing PK reliance. This work provides the first framework for systematic studies of multi-step knowledge interactions in LLMs through a richer rank-2 subspace disentanglement.

Abstract: Language model (LM) assistants are increasingly used in applications such as brainstorming and research. Improvements in memory and context size have allowed these models to become more autonomous, which has also resulted in more text accumulation in their context windows without explicit user intervention. This comes with a latent risk: the belief profiles of models -- their understanding of the world as manifested in their responses or actions -- may silently change as context accumulates. This can lead to subtly inconsistent user experiences, or shifts in behavior that deviate from the original alignment of the models. In this paper, we explore how accumulating context by engaging in interactions and processing text -- talking and reading -- can change the beliefs of language models, as manifested in their responses and behaviors.Our results reveal that models' belief profiles are highly malleable: GPT-5 exhibits a 54.7% shift in its stated beliefs after 10 rounds of discussion about moral dilemmas and queries about safety, while Grok 4 shows a 27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from the opposing position. We also examine models' behavioral changes by designing tasks that require tool use, where each tool selection corresponds to an implicit belief. We find that these changes align with stated belief shifts, suggesting that belief shifts will be reflected in actual behavior in agentic systems. Our analysis exposes the hidden risk of belief shift as models undergo extended sessions of talking or reading, rendering their opinions and actions unreliable.

<title>Plan-and-Write: Structure-Guided Length Control for LLMs without Model Retraining</title>

Abstract: Length control in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial but under-addressed challenge, with applications ranging from voice interfaces requiring concise responses to research summaries needing comprehensive outputs. Current approaches to length control, including Regularized DPO, Length-Instruction Fine Tuning, and tool-augmented methods, typically require expensive model retraining or complex inference-time tooling. This paper presents a prompt engineering methodology that enables precise length control without model retraining. Our structure-guided approach implements deliberate planning and word counting mechanisms within the prompt, encouraging the model to carefully track and adhere to specified length constraints. Comprehensive evaluations across six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our method significantly improves length fidelity for several models compared to standard prompting when applied to document summarization tasks, particularly for shorter-to-medium length constraints. The proposed technique shows varying benefits across different model architectures, with some models demonstrating up to 37.6% improvement in length adherence. Quality evaluations further reveal that our approach maintains or enhances overall output quality compared to standard prompting techniques. Our approach provides an immediately deployable solution for applications requiring precise length control, particularly valuable for production environments where model retraining is impractical or cost-prohibitive.

<title>KV Cache Transform Coding for Compact Storage in LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) at scale necessitates efficient key-value (KV) cache management. KV caches can be reused across conversation turns via shared-prefix prompts that are common in iterative code editing and chat. However, stale caches consume scarce GPU memory, require offloading, or force recomputation. We present KVTC, a lightweight transform coder that compresses KV caches for compact on-GPU and off-GPU storage. Drawing on classical media compression, KVTC combines PCA-based feature decorrelation, adaptive quantization, and entropy coding. It requires only a brief initial calibration and leaves model parameters unchanged. By exploiting redundancies in KV caches, KVTC achieves up to 20$\times$ compression while maintaining reasoning and long-context accuracy, and 40$\times$ or higher for specific use cases. We test KVTC with Llama 3, Mistral NeMo, and R1-Qwen 2.5 models across benchmarks including AIME25, LiveCodeBench, GSM8K, MMLU, Qasper, RULER, and MATH-500. It consistently outperforms inference-time baselines such as token eviction, quantization, and SVD-based methods, while achieving higher compression ratios. These results support KVTC as a practical building block for memory-efficient LLM serving with reusable KV caches.

Abstract: Finding the right north-star metrics is highly critical for advancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of foundation models, especially given that existing evaluations are either too easy or only focus on getting correct short answers. To address these issues, we present IMO-Bench, a suite of advanced reasoning benchmarks, vetted by a panel of top specialists and that specifically targets the level of the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), the most prestigious venue for young mathematicians. IMO-AnswerBench first tests models on 400 diverse Olympiad problems with verifiable short answers. IMO-Proof Bench is the next-level evaluation for proof-writing capabilities, which includes both basic and advanced IMO level problems as well as detailed grading guidelines to facilitate automatic grading. These benchmarks played a crucial role in our historic achievement of the gold-level performance at IMO 2025 with Gemini Deep Think (Luong and Lockhart, 2025). Our model achieved 80.0% on IMO-AnswerBench and 65.7% on the advanced IMO-Proof Bench, surpassing the best non-Gemini models by large margins of 6.9% and 42.4% respectively. We also showed that autograders built with Gemini reasoning correlate well with human evaluations and construct IMO-GradingBench, with 1000 human gradings on proofs, to enable further progress in automatic evaluation of long-form answers. We hope that IMO-Bench will help the community towards advancing robust mathematical reasoning and release it at https://imobench.github.io/.

<title>Tool-to-Agent Retrieval: Bridging Tools and Agents for Scalable LLM Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration of sub-agents, each coordinating hundreds or thousands of tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. However, existing retrieval methods typically match queries against coarse agent-level descriptions before routing, which obscures fine-grained tool functionality and often results in suboptimal agent selection. We introduce Tool-to-Agent Retrieval, a unified framework that embeds both tools and their parent agents in a shared vector space and connects them through metadata relationships. By explicitly representing tool capabilities and traversing metadata to the agent level, Tool-to-Agent Retrieval enables granular tool-level or agent-level retrieval, ensuring that agents and their underlying tools or MCP servers are equally represented without the context dilution that arises from chunking many tools together. Evaluating Tool-to-Agent Retrieval across eight embedding models, our approach achieves consistent improvements of 19.4% in Recall@5 and 17.7% in nDCG@5 over previous state-of-the-art agent retrievers on the LiveMCPBench benchmark.

Abstract: Natural disaster assessment relies on accurate and rapid access to information, with social media emerging as a valuable real-time source. However, existing datasets suffer from class imbalance and limited samples, making effective model development a challenging task. This paper explores augmentation techniques to address these issues on the CrisisMMD multimodal dataset. For visual data, we apply diffusion-based methods, namely Real Guidance and DiffuseMix. For text data, we explore back-translation, paraphrasing with transformers, and image caption-based augmentation. We evaluated these across unimodal, multimodal, and multi-view learning setups. Results show that selected augmentations improve classification performance, particularly for underrepresented classes, while multi-view learning introduces potential but requires further refinement. This study highlights effective augmentation strategies for building more robust disaster assessment systems.

Abstract: In the current digital commerce landscape, user-generated reviews play a critical role in shaping consumer behavior, product reputation, and platform credibility. However, the proliferation of fake or misleading reviews often generated by bots, paid agents, or AI models poses a significant threat to trust and transparency within review ecosystems. Existing detection models primarily rely on unimodal, typically textual, data and therefore fail to capture semantic inconsistencies across different modalities. To address this gap, a robust multimodal fake review detection framework is proposed, integrating textual features encoded with BERT and visual features extracted using ResNet-50. These representations are fused through a classification head to jointly predict review authenticity. To support this approach, a curated dataset comprising 21,142 user-uploaded images across food delivery, hospitality, and e-commerce domains was utilized. Experimental results indicate that the multimodal model outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving an F1-score of 0.934 on the test set. Additionally, the confusion matrix and qualitative analysis highlight the model's ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, such as exaggerated textual praise paired with unrelated or low-quality images, commonly found in deceptive content. This study demonstrates the critical role of multimodal learning in safeguarding digital trust and offers a scalable solution for content moderation across various online platforms.

Abstract: In the context of global sustainability mandates, corporate carbon disclosure has emerged as a critical mechanism for aligning business strategy with environmental responsibility. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) hosts the world's largest longitudinal dataset of climate-related survey responses, combining structured indicators with open-ended narratives, but the heterogeneity and free-form nature of these disclosures present significant analytical challenges for benchmarking, compliance monitoring, and investment screening. This paper proposes a novel decision-support framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to assess corporate climate disclosure quality at scale. It develops a master rubric that harmonizes narrative scoring across 11 years of CDP data (2010-2020), enabling cross-sector and cross-country benchmarking. By integrating rubric-guided scoring with percentile-based normalization, our method identifies temporal trends, strategic alignment patterns, and inconsistencies in disclosure across industries and regions. Results reveal that sectors such as technology and countries like Germany consistently demonstrate higher rubric alignment, while others exhibit volatility or superficial engagement, offering insights that inform key decision-making processes for investors, regulators, and corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategists. The proposed LLM-based approach transforms unstructured disclosures into quantifiable, interpretable, comparable, and actionable intelligence, advancing the capabilities of AI-enabled decision support systems (DSSs) in the domain of climate governance.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference, typically through parallel, sequential, or hybrid scaling. However, prior studies often assume fixed collaboration architectures (e.g., topologies) and single-model usage, overlooking that optimal architectures and model combinations can vary across tasks. Therefore, we study the novel problem of searching for compute-optimal model combinations and architectures in TTS under a fixed budget. We formalize it as a multi-LLM collaboration graph, where nodes encode roles and LLM model assignments, and edges capture information flow. This problem is challenging because (i) the combinatorial search space is prohibitively large, and (ii) task-specific requirements demand tailored designs. To address these, we reformulate the problem as probabilistic graph optimization and, through pilot experiments, derive three empirical insights into TTS collaboration graphs. Guided by these insights, we propose Agent-REINFORCE, an LLM-agent-augmented framework that mirrors the REINFORCE pipeline by mapping sampling-gradient-update to sampling-feedback-update, where feedback serves as a textual gradient to update the probabilistic graph and efficiently search for optimal multi-LLM collaboration graphs. Experiments show that Agent-REINFORCE outperforms both traditional and LLM-based baselines in sample efficiency and search performance, and effectively identifies optimal graphs under joint objectives of accuracy and inference latency.

Abstract: Large language models are now integrated into many scientific workflows, accelerating data analysis, hypothesis generation, and design space exploration. In parallel with this growth, there is a growing need to carefully evaluate whether models accurately capture domain-specific knowledge and notation, since general-purpose benchmarks rarely reflect these requirements. This gap is especially clear in quantum science, which features non-intuitive phenomena and requires advanced mathematics. In this study, we introduce QuantumBench, a benchmark for the quantum domain that systematically examine how well LLMs understand and can be applied to this non-intuitive field. Using publicly available materials, we compiled approximately 800 questions with their answers spanning nine areas related to quantum science and organized them into an eight-option multiple-choice dataset. With this benchmark, we evaluate several existing LLMs and analyze their performance in the quantum domain, including sensitivity to changes in question format. QuantumBench is the first LLM evaluation dataset built for the quantum domain, and it is intended to guide the effective use of LLMs in quantum research.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how studying the rhetorics of ChatGPT prompt writing on social media can promote critical AI literacies. Prompt writing is the process of writing instructions for generative AI tools like ChatGPT to elicit desired outputs and there has been an upsurge of conversations about it on social media. To study this rhetorical activity, we build on four overlapping traditions of digital writing research in computers and composition that inform how we frame literacies, how we study social media rhetorics, how we engage iteratively and reflexively with methodologies and technologies, and how we blend computational methods with qualitative methods. Drawing on these four traditions, our paper shows our iterative research process through which we gathered and analyzed a dataset of 32,000 posts (formerly known as tweets) from X (formerly Twitter) about prompt writing posted between November 2022 to May 2023. We present five themes about these emerging AI literacy practices: (1) areas of communication impacted by prompt writing, (2) micro-literacy resources shared for prompt writing, (3) market rhetoric shaping prompt writing, (4) rhetorical characteristics of prompts, and (5) definitions of prompt writing. In discussing these themes and our methodologies, we highlight takeaways for digital writing teachers and researchers who are teaching and analyzing critical AI literacies.

Abstract: Contemporary e-mail services have high availability expectations from the customers and are resource-strained because of the high-volume throughput and spam attacks. Deep Machine Learning architectures, which are resource hungry and require off-line processing due to the long processing times, are not acceptable at the front line filters. On the other hand, the bulk of the incoming spam is not sophisticated enough to bypass even the simplest algorithms. While the small fraction of the intelligent, highly mutable spam can be detected only by the deep architectures, the stress on them can be unloaded by the simple near real-time and near zero-footprint algorithms such as the Bag of Synthetic Syllables algorithm applied to the short texts of the e-mail subject lines and other short text fields. The proposed algorithm creates a circa 200 sparse dimensional hash or vector for each e-mail subject line that can be compared for the cosine or euclidean proximity distance to find similarities to the known spammy subjects. The algorithm does not require any persistent storage, dictionaries, additional hardware upgrades or software packages. The performance of the algorithm is presented on the one day of the real SMTP traffic.

<title>Can SAEs reveal and mitigate racial biases of LLMs in healthcare?</title>

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly being used in healthcare. This promises to free physicians from drudgery, enabling better care to be delivered at scale. But the use of LLMs in this space also brings risks; for example, such models may worsen existing biases. How can we spot when LLMs are (spuriously) relying on patient race to inform predictions? In this work we assess the degree to which Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can reveal (and control) associations the model has made between race and stigmatizing concepts. We first identify SAE latents in Gemma-2 models which appear to correlate with Black individuals. We find that this latent activates on reasonable input sequences (e.g., "African American") but also problematic words like "incarceration". We then show that we can use this latent to steer models to generate outputs about Black patients, and further that this can induce problematic associations in model outputs as a result. For example, activating the Black latent increases the risk assigned to the probability that a patient will become "belligerent". We evaluate the degree to which such steering via latents might be useful for mitigating bias. We find that this offers improvements in simple settings, but is less successful for more realistic and complex clinical tasks. Overall, our results suggest that: SAEs may offer a useful tool in clinical applications of LLMs to identify problematic reliance on demographics but mitigating bias via SAE steering appears to be of marginal utility for realistic tasks.

Abstract: Cognitive science faces ongoing challenges in knowledge synthesis and conceptual clarity, in part due to its multifaceted and interdisciplinary nature. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly the development of large language models (LLMs), offer tools that may help to address these issues. This review examines how LLMs can support areas where the field has historically struggled, including establishing cross-disciplinary connections, formalizing theories, developing clear measurement taxonomies, achieving generalizability through integrated modeling frameworks, and capturing contextual and individual variation. We outline the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in these domains, including potential pitfalls. Taken together, we conclude that LLMs can serve as tools for a more integrative and cumulative cognitive science when used judiciously to complement, rather than replace, human expertise.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Omni, a state-of-the-art open-source omni-modal model with 560 billion parameters, excelling at real-time audio-visual interaction. By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated inherent calibration capabilities, where predicted probabilities align well with correctness, despite prior findings that deep neural networks are often overconfident. Recent studies have linked this behavior to specific components in the final layer, such as entropy neurons and the unembedding matrix null space. In this work, we provide a complementary perspective by investigating how calibration evolves throughout the network depth. Analyzing multiple open-weight models on the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a distinct confidence correction phase in the upper/later layers, where model confidence is actively recalibrated after decision certainty has been reached. Furthermore, we identify a low-dimensional calibration direction in the residual stream whose perturbation significantly improves calibration metrics (ECE and MCE) without harming accuracy. Our findings suggest that calibration is a distributed phenomenon, shaped throughout the network forward pass, not just in its final projection, providing new insights into how confidence-regulating mechanisms operate within LLMs.

<title>Reject Only Critical Tokens: Pivot-Aware Speculative Decoding</title>

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) ensures that the output matches the target model's distribution exactly. However, we argue that this distribution matching requirement is too stringent and results in unnecessarily low acceptance rates, limiting potential speedups. Instead, we advocate a reformulation of the decoding objective: the proposed decoding strategy should match the expected utility, i.e., the task-specific performance, of the target model. This perspective also aligns better with real-world use cases of LLMs, where utility (e.g., code correctness, factual accuracy) is often more important than sampling distribution. Based on this reformulation, we propose a novel decoding strategy: Pivot-Aware Speculative Decoding, which rejects only those tokens that would lead to a utility drop in the final output. We refer to these critical tokens as pivot tokens. We propose a method for labeling tokens as pivotal or non-pivotal and train a lightweight classifier to detect them. This method can be viewed as a relaxed version of standard SD, which offers much higher acceptance while preserving utility. We evaluate our method across various datasets, demonstrating that we can achieve up to $2.5\times$ speedup with comparable utility. Source code is available at https://github.com/amir-zsh/PAD.

<title>Diverse Human Value Alignment for Large Language Models via Ethical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with the diverse and evolving human values across different regions and cultures remains a critical challenge in AI ethics. Current alignment approaches often yield superficial conformity rather than genuine ethical understanding, failing to address the complex, context-dependent nature of human values. In this paper, we propose a novel ethical reasoning paradigm for LLMs inspired by well-established ethical decision-making models, aiming at enhancing diverse human value alignment through deliberative ethical reasoning. Our framework consists of a structured five-step process, including contextual fact gathering, hierarchical social norm identification, option generation, multiple-lens ethical impact analysis, and reflection. This theory-grounded approach guides LLMs through an interpretable reasoning process that enhances their ability to understand regional specificities and perform nuanced ethical analysis, which can be implemented with either prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning methods. We perform evaluations on the SafeWorld benchmark that specially designed for regional value alignment. Experimental results demonstrate our framework significantly improves LLM alignment with diverse human values compared to baseline methods, enabling more accurate social norm identification and more culturally appropriate reasoning. Our work provides a concrete pathway toward developing LLMs that align more effectively with the multifaceted values of global societies through interdisciplinary research.

<title>\texttt{ReMind}: Understanding Deductive Code Reasoning in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code-related tasks. Despite their advancement, empirical evidence reveals that they still struggle with \emph{deductive code reasoning}, the ability to reason about the program execution process. While prior studies have recognized this limitation, the underlying causes remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we begin by presenting a comprehensive empirical study that reveals three key challenges undermining deductive code reasoning: (1) an intrinsic gap between generation and reasoning abilities, (2) a consistent bias towards code sources, and (3) weak zero-shot generalization on complex benchmarks. In light of these challenges, we propose \texttt{ReMind}, a multi-agent framework composed of \texttt{Mutator}, \texttt{Executor}, and \texttt{Inspector}. The \texttt{Mutator} generates code variants to mitigate bias towards code sources, the \texttt{Executor} traces variable states step-by-step to expose inconsistency, and the \texttt{Inspector} identifies problematic reasoning steps and provides control-flow refinement to bridge the intrinsic reasoning gap. Through their coordinated collaboration, \texttt{ReMind} systematically identifies and refines reasoning flaws, achieving outstanding performance and enabling robust zero-shot generalization. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with five LLMs demonstrate the superior advantages of \texttt{ReMind} compared to baseline approaches in deductive code reasoning.

<title>Reasoning Planning for Language Models</title>

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate reasoning method for a given query remains a key challenge in language model generation. Existing approaches typically generate multiple candidate responses and use an aggregation strategy to select the output answer, often assuming that more candidate answers yield higher accuracy. We revisit this assumption through a rigorous theoretical analysis, deriving accuracy bounds for standard aggregation methods under fixed generation distributions and candidate sizes. Building on these insights, we introduce EPIC, an Ensemble Planning with Contrastive learning framework to learn a shared representation space that captures both model reasoning abilities and query-method compatibility. EPIC incorporates our probability bounds as a regularizer in a utility-driven optimization that balances accuracy and computational cost. Experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning tasks show that EPIC consistently selects optimal reasoning methods, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Our code can be found at https://github.com/nguyenngocbaocmt02/EPIC.

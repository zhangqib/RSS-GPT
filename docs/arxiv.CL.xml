Summary: 
The study introduces AAAR-1.0, a benchmark dataset tailored for evaluating the performance of large language models in research tasks. The dataset focuses on EquationInference, ExperimentDesign, PaperWeakness, and REVIEWCRITIQUE tasks, which require deep domain expertise. Unlike previous benchmarks, AAAR-1.0 is specifically designed for researchers, reflecting their daily activities. An evaluation of open-source and proprietary LLMs indicates their potential but also highlights limitations in handling intricate research tasks. The researchers plan to continue iterating AAAR-1.0 to enhance its usefulness for research communities.

Abstract: Numerous studies have assessed the proficiency of AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), in facilitating everyday tasks such as email writing, question answering, and creative content generation. However, researchers face unique challenges and opportunities in leveraging LLMs for their own work, such as brainstorming research ideas, designing experiments, and writing or reviewing papers. In this study, we introduce AAAR-1.0, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLM performance in three fundamental, expertise-intensive research tasks: (i) EquationInference, assessing the correctness of equations based on the contextual information in paper submissions; (ii) ExperimentDesign, designing experiments to validate research ideas and solutions; (iii) PaperWeakness, identifying weaknesses in paper submissions; and (iv) REVIEWCRITIQUE, identifying each segment in human reviews is deficient or not. AAAR-1.0 differs from prior benchmarks in two key ways: first, it is explicitly research-oriented, with tasks requiring deep domain expertise; second, it is researcher-oriented, mirroring the primary activities that researchers engage in on a daily basis. An evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LLMs reveals their potential as well as limitations in conducting sophisticated research tasks. We will keep iterating AAAR-1.0 to new versions.

Summary: <br>
The paper introduces a novel approach, ROUTE, to enhance the capabilities of open-source language models (LLMs) for Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) tasks. The method involves multi-task supervised fine-tuning with various tasks such as schema linking, noise correction, and continuation writing to improve SQL generation. Additionally, the Multitask Collaboration Prompting (MCP) strategy is introduced to leverage collaboration across different SQL-related tasks and reduce hallucinations during SQL generation. The experiments conducted on eight open-source LLMs and five benchmarks show that ROUTE outperforms existing Text2SQL methods, demonstrating superior performance in SQL generation. <div>

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) facilitated by large language models (LLMs), the latest state-of-the-art techniques are still trapped in the in-context learning of closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), which limits their applicability in open scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel RObust mUltitask Tuning and collaboration mEthod (ROUTE) to improve the comprehensive capabilities of open-source LLMs for Text2SQL, thereby providing a more practical solution. Our approach begins with multi-task supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using various synthetic training data related to SQL generation. Unlike existing SFT-based Text2SQL methods, we introduced several additional SFT tasks, including schema linking, noise correction, and continuation writing. Engaging in a variety of SQL generation tasks enhances the model's understanding of SQL syntax and improves its ability to generate high-quality SQL queries. Additionally, inspired by the collaborative modes of LLM agents, we introduce a Multitask Collaboration Prompting (MCP) strategy. This strategy leverages collaboration across several SQL-related tasks to reduce hallucinations during SQL generation, thereby maximizing the potential of enhancing Text2SQL performance through explicit multitask capabilities. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses have been performed on eight open-source LLMs and five widely-used benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the latest Text2SQL methods and yields leading performance.

<div> brain-inspired, large language model, SiFu, interpretability, signal flow

Summary:<br>
This paper introduces the first brain-inspired large language model, BriLLM, which uses a non-traditional machine learning approach based on the SiFu model. The model operates on a directed graph with interpretability for all nodes, allowing for more extensive analysis. In the language model scenario, tokens are defined as nodes, and a signal flow determines the next predicted token. BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long n-gram models, offering recall activation and multi-modal support similar to human cognitive patterns. The initial Chinese version of BriLLM has 4000 tokens, a 32-dimensional node width, and comparable performance to GPT-1. Further exploration with additional computing power aims to unlock the model's full potential. <br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper reports the first brain-inspired large language model (BriLLM). This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.

Abstract: Improving training efficiency continues to be one of the primary challenges in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate how context length and the complexity of training data influence the RL scaling training process of R1-distilled small reasoning models, e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) simply controlling the context length and curating the training data based on the input prompt length can effectively improve the training efficiency of scaling RL, achieving better performance with more concise CoT; (2) properly scaling the context length helps mitigate entropy collapse; and (3) choosing an optimal context length can improve the efficiency of model training and incentivize the model's chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities. Inspired by these insights, we propose FastCuRL, a curriculum RL framework with stage-wise context scaling to achieve efficient training and concise CoT reasoning. Experiment results demonstrate that FastCuRL-1.5B-V3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on five competition-level benchmarks and achieves 49.6\% accuracy on AIME 2024. Furthermore, FastCuRL-1.5B-Preview surpasses DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview on five benchmarks while only using a single node with 8 GPUs and a total of 50\% of training steps. %The code, training data, and models will be publicly released.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, it is essential to assess how they perform on established benchmarks. In this study, we present a suite of experiments to assess the performance of modern LLMs (ranging from 3B to 90B+ parameters) on CaseHOLD, a legal benchmark dataset for identifying case holdings. Our experiments demonstrate scaling effects - performance on this task improves with model size, with more capable models like GPT4o and AmazonNovaPro achieving macro F1 scores of 0.744 and 0.720 respectively. These scores are competitive with the best published results on this dataset, and do not require any technically sophisticated model training, fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. To ensure that these strong results are not due to memorization of judicial opinions contained in the training data, we develop and utilize a novel citation anonymization test that preserves semantic meaning while ensuring case names and citations are fictitious. Models maintain strong performance under these conditions (macro F1 of 0.728), suggesting the performance is not due to rote memorization. These findings demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for legal tasks with important implications for the development and measurement of automated legal analytics and legal benchmarks.

Summary:
Multilingual language models like LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ show promise in automated hate speech detection. A study evaluated the effectiveness of LLM prompting-based detection in eight non-English languages, comparing it to fine-tuned encoder models. While zero-shot and few-shot prompting techniques lag behind fine-tuned models in real-world evaluations, they demonstrate better generalization for hate speech detection in functional tests. The study highlights the importance of customized prompt design for each language to maximize performance. This research sheds light on the potential of multilingual LLMs in identifying hate speech online and suggests the need for tailored prompting strategies to enhance detection capabilities across diverse languages.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in automated hate speech detection, most existing approaches overlook the linguistic diversity of online content. Multilingual instruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ offer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in identifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains underexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight non-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing them to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot prompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world evaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for hate speech detection. Our study also reveals that prompt design plays a critical role, with each language often requiring customized prompting techniques to maximize performance.

Abstract: We present PersonaConvBench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating personalized reasoning and generation in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing work that focuses on either personalization or conversational structure in isolation, PersonaConvBench integrates both, offering three core tasks: sentence classification, impact regression, and user-centric text generation across ten diverse Reddit-based domains. This design enables systematic analysis of how personalized conversational context shapes LLM outputs in realistic multi-user scenarios. We benchmark several commercial and open-source LLMs under a unified prompting setup and observe that incorporating personalized history yields substantial performance improvements, including a 198 percent relative gain over the best non-conversational baseline in sentiment classification. By releasing PersonaConvBench with evaluations and code, we aim to support research on LLMs that adapt to individual styles, track long-term context, and produce contextually rich, engaging responses.

Abstract: The emergence of groundbreaking large language models capable of performing complex reasoning tasks holds significant promise for addressing various scientific challenges, including those arising in complex clinical scenarios. To enable their safe and effective deployment in real-world healthcare settings, it is urgently necessary to benchmark the diagnostic capabilities of current models systematically. Given the limitations of existing medical benchmarks in evaluating advanced diagnostic reasoning, we present DiagnosisArena, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark designed to rigorously assess professional-level diagnostic competence. DiagnosisArena consists of 1,113 pairs of segmented patient cases and corresponding diagnoses, spanning 28 medical specialties, deriving from clinical case reports published in 10 top-tier medical journals. The benchmark is developed through a meticulous construction pipeline, involving multiple rounds of screening and review by both AI systems and human experts, with thorough checks conducted to prevent data leakage. Our study reveals that even the most advanced reasoning models, o3-mini, o1, and DeepSeek-R1, achieve only 45.82%, 31.09%, and 17.79% accuracy, respectively. This finding highlights a significant generalization bottleneck in current large language models when faced with clinical diagnostic reasoning challenges. Through DiagnosisArena, we aim to drive further advancements in AIs diagnostic reasoning capabilities, enabling more effective solutions for real-world clinical diagnostic challenges. We provide the benchmark and evaluation tools for further research and development https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/DiagnosisArena.

Abstract: Considering the importance of detecting hateful language, labeled hate speech data is expensive and time-consuming to collect, particularly for low-resource languages. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer learning and data augmentation in improving performance on tasks with limited labeled data. To develop an efficient and scalable cross-lingual transfer learning approach, we leverage nearest-neighbor retrieval to augment minimal labeled data in the target language, thereby enhancing detection performance. Specifically, we assume access to a small set of labeled training instances in the target language and use these to retrieve the most relevant labeled examples from a large multilingual hate speech detection pool. We evaluate our approach on eight languages and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms models trained solely on the target language data. Furthermore, in most cases, our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach is highly data-efficient, retrieving as small as 200 instances in some cases while maintaining superior performance. Moreover, it is scalable, as the retrieval pool can be easily expanded, and the method can be readily adapted to new languages and tasks. We also apply maximum marginal relevance to mitigate redundancy and filter out highly similar retrieved instances, resulting in improvements in some languages.

Summary: 
MathIF introduces a benchmark for assessing instruction-following in mathematical reasoning tasks. The study reveals a trade-off between reasoning capacity and compliance with user directives in large language models. Models that excel at reasoning struggle to adhere to instructions, particularly as generation length increases. Training models on long chains-of-thought or with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning can lead to decreased instruction adherence. Simple interventions can partially improve obedience but at the expense of reasoning performance. These findings underscore a fundamental challenge in current large language model training methods and emphasize the need for instruction-aware reasoning models. The code and data for MathIF are available at https://github.com/TingchenFu/MathIF.

Abstract: Instruction-following is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent. While recent reasoning-oriented models exhibit impressive performance on complex mathematical problems, their ability to adhere to natural language instructions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MathIF, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals a consistent tension between scaling up reasoning capacity and maintaining controllability, as models that reason more effectively often struggle to comply with user directives. We find that models tuned on distilled long chains-of-thought or trained with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning often degrade in instruction adherence, especially when generation length increases. Furthermore, we show that even simple interventions can partially recover obedience, though at the cost of reasoning performance. These findings highlight a fundamental tension in current LLM training paradigms and motivate the need for more instruction-aware reasoning models. We release the code and data at https://github.com/TingchenFu/MathIF.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces MAS-ZERO, a framework for automatic design of Multi-agent systems (MAS) using Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike traditional MAS that rely on manual design, MAS-ZERO leverages meta-level design to generate and refine MAS configurations tailored to each specific problem instance without the need for a validation set. This framework allows for dynamic agent composition and problem decomposition based on meta-feedback on solvability and completeness. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that MAS-ZERO surpasses both manual and automatic MAS baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement while remaining cost-efficient. The study highlights the potential of meta-level self-evolved design in creating effective and adaptive MAS. <br> <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks. However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically necessitate a validation set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking adaptability during inference. We introduce MAS-ZERO, the first self-evolved, inference-time framework for automatic MAS design. MAS-ZERO employs meta-level design to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness. Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM backbones of varying sizes, demonstrate that MAS-ZERO outperforms both manual and automatic MAS baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency. These findings underscore the promise of meta-level self-evolved design for creating effective and adaptive MAS.

Summary:
Self-GIVE is a framework that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) with automatic associative thinking through reinforcement learning. It uses a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured knowledge, addressing the limitations of the Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE) method. Self-GIVE improves LLM performance, particularly in challenging biomedical QA tasks, by up to 71.4% and 90.5% in samples unseen previously. It allows the 7B model to match or outperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while significantly reducing token usage. Self-GIVE facilitates the scalable integration of structured retrieval and reasoning with associative thinking, offering a more efficient and generalizable approach for addressing complex questions that require new information. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: When addressing complex questions that require new information, people often associate the question with existing knowledge to derive a sensible answer. For instance, when evaluating whether melatonin aids insomnia, one might associate "hormones helping mental disorders" with "melatonin being a hormone and insomnia a mental disorder" to complete the reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving scientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not directly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE) addresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured knowledge. However, it involves the construction and pruning of many hypothetical triplets, which limits efficiency and generalizability. We propose Self-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic associative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts structured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the queried concepts. We address GIVE's key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls and token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on smaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate knowledge from LLM pruning. Specifically, after fine-tuning using self-GIVE with a 135 node UMLS KG, it improves the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B and 7B models by up to $\textbf{28.5%$\rightarrow$71.4%}$ and $\textbf{78.6$\rightarrow$90.5%}$ in samples $\textbf{unseen}$ in challenging biomedical QA tasks. In particular, Self-GIVE allows the 7B model to match or outperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while cutting token usage by over 90\%. Self-GIVE enhances the scalable integration of structured retrieval and reasoning with associative thinking.

Abstract: Efficient multi-hop reasoning requires Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents to acquire high-value external knowledge iteratively. Previous work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2% absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our code will be released on https://github.com/Zillwang/StepSearch.

Summary: 
Contrastive Paraphrase Attack (CoPA) is introduced as a training-free method to deceive text detectors using off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs). By crafting instructions that encourage LLMs to create more human-like texts and introducing an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast, CoPA is able to generate sentences that are less detectable by text detectors. The method effectively addresses the challenge of advanced detection algorithms and reduces the need for substantial data and computational resources required by existing paraphrase attack methods. The theoretical analysis supports the superiority of CoPA in fooling text detectors, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness across various scenarios. CoPA's innovative approach provides a valuable tool for mitigating academic plagiarism and other forms of misuse of LLMs.

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.

Summary:
Our work focuses on improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for external datasets. Inspired by the DeepSeek-R1 model, we introduce a steering technique that utilizes Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data. These features are then used to steer the internal states of the LLM during generation, resulting in enhanced reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a novel SAE-free steering algorithm that computes steering directions directly from the residual activations of the LLM, eliminating the need for an explicit SAE. Experimental results show significant improvements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs using both the SAE-based and SAE-free steering algorithms. This approach makes it possible to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without the need for costly external datasets.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to solve reasoning and mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. Expanding CoT length, as seen in models such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly enhances this reasoning for complex problems, but requires costly and high-quality long CoT data and fine-tuning. This work, inspired by the deep thinking paradigm of DeepSeek-R1, utilizes a steering technique to enhance the reasoning ability of an LLM without external datasets. Our method first employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla CoT. These features are then used to steer the LLM's internal states during generation. Recognizing that many LLMs do not have corresponding pre-trained SAEs, we further introduce a novel SAE-free steering algorithm, which directly computes steering directions from the residual activations of an LLM, obviating the need for an explicit SAE. Experimental results demonstrate that both our SAE-based and subsequent SAE-free steering algorithms significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Summary:
TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization) is introduced as a framework that enhances reinforcement learning by incorporating external high-level guidance, known as "thought patterns." This approach aims to balance model exploration and external guidance exploitation, resulting in superior performance compared to existing RL methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective method for training reasoning models. However, existing RL approaches typically bias the model's output distribution toward reward-maximizing paths without introducing external knowledge. This limits their exploration capacity and results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. To address this limitation, we propose TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization), a novel framework that augments RL by incorporating external high-level guidance ("thought patterns"). By adaptively integrating structured thoughts during training, TAPO effectively balances model-internal exploration and external guidance exploitation. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME, 41% on AMC, and 17% on Minerva Math. Notably, these high-level thought patterns, abstracted from only 500 prior samples, generalize effectively across various tasks and models. This highlights TAPO's potential for broader applications across multiple tasks and domains. Our further analysis reveals that introducing external guidance produces powerful reasoning models with superior explainability of inference behavior and enhanced output readability.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the process of efficiently removing specific information from machine learning models, is a growing area of interest for responsible AI. However, few studies have explored the effectiveness of unlearning methods on complex tasks, particularly speech-related ones. This paper introduces UnSLU-BENCH, the first benchmark for machine unlearning in spoken language understanding (SLU), focusing on four datasets spanning four languages. We address the unlearning of data from specific speakers as a way to evaluate the quality of potential "right to be forgotten" requests. We assess eight unlearning techniques and propose a novel metric to simultaneously better capture their efficacy, utility, and efficiency. UnSLU-BENCH sets a foundation for unlearning in SLU and reveals significant differences in the effectiveness and computational feasibility of various techniques.

Abstract: Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the performance of reference-based reward systems.

Current models still show considerable room for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.

Experimental results demonstrate that O$^2$-Searcher outperforms leading large language model agents on O$^2$-QA using a 3B model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies. Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on par with much larger ones.

Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines.

Summary:<br><br>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled autonomous agents to interact with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by accurately localizing interface elements. The traditional method of relying on large-scale web datasets for grounding accuracy is challenging. The proposed ReGUIDE framework addresses this issue by utilizing self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism. ReGUIDE learns a language reasoning process through online reinforcement learning and criticizes predictions using spatial priors. At inference, ReGUIDE enhances performance through a test-time scaling strategy. Experimental results show that ReGUIDE outperforms baselines with significantly fewer training data points, showcasing its effectiveness in web grounding tasks. By leveraging self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism, ReGUIDE offers a data-efficient solution for improving grounding accuracy in GUI interactions. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements (e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism. More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii) criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2% samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

Summary: 
The paper introduces a framework for identifying creator intent in multimodal misinformation detection systems. It creates a benchmark dataset called DeceptionDecoded with 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles, capturing both misleading and non-misleading intents across visual and textual modalities. The study evaluates 14 vision-language models on tasks such as misleading intent detection, misleading source attribution, and creator desire inference, revealing that current models struggle to accurately detect misleading intent. The findings emphasize the importance of intent-aware modeling in misinformation detection and suggest the need for systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation. <div>

Abstract: The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: The digital exclusion of endangered languages remains a critical challenge in NLP, limiting both linguistic research and revitalization efforts. This study introduces the first computational investigation of Comanche, an Uto-Aztecan language on the verge of extinction, demonstrating how minimal-cost, community-informed NLP interventions can support language preservation. We present a manually curated dataset of 412 phrases, a synthetic data generation pipeline, and an empirical evaluation of GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini for language identification. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with Comanche in zero-shot settings, few-shot prompting significantly improves performance, achieving near-perfect accuracy with just five examples. Our findings highlight the potential of targeted NLP methodologies in low-resource contexts and emphasize that visibility is the first step toward inclusion. By establishing a foundation for Comanche in NLP, we advocate for computational approaches that prioritize accessibility, cultural sensitivity, and community engagement.

<div> Keywords: BERT-like models, LLMs, text classification, task-specific model strengths, TaMAS<br />
Summary: 
This study challenges the prevailing trend of relying solely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for text classification by comparing them with BERT-like models in high-difficulty datasets. The research reveals that BERT-like models often outperform LLMs in certain tasks. By categorizing datasets into different types and conducting PCA and probing experiments, the study identifies that BERT-like models excel in pattern-driven tasks while LLMs are better suited for tasks requiring deep semantics or world knowledge. Based on these findings, the authors propose TaMAS, a fine-grained task selection strategy that advocates for a nuanced, task-driven approach rather than a one-size-fits-all reliance on LLMs. This research highlights the importance of considering task-specific model strengths in text classification tasks and provides a new perspective on leveraging both BERT-like models and LLMs effectively. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLMs has overshadowed the potential advantages of traditional BERT-like models in text classification. This study challenges the prevailing "LLM-centric" trend by systematically comparing three category methods, i.e., BERT-like models fine-tuning, LLM internal state utilization, and zero-shot inference across six high-difficulty datasets. Our findings reveal that BERT-like models often outperform LLMs. We further categorize datasets into three types, perform PCA and probing experiments, and identify task-specific model strengths: BERT-like models excel in pattern-driven tasks, while LLMs dominate those requiring deep semantics or world knowledge. Based on this, we propose TaMAS, a fine-grained task selection strategy, advocating for a nuanced, task-driven approach over a one-size-fits-all reliance on LLMs.

<div> Metaphors, Language Models, Covert Communication, Semantic Evasion, Multi-Agent Language Games <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces CoMet, a framework designed to help large language models (LLMs) interpret and apply metaphors in multi-agent language games. Metaphors play a crucial role in expressing complex ideas by comparing concepts from different domains. However, many LLMs struggle with metaphor processing, impacting their ability to engage in covert communication and semantic evasion. CoMet combines a metaphor reasoner with a generator that improves through self-reflection and knowledge integration. Through experiments on two language games, Undercover and Adversarial Taboo, CoMet was shown to significantly enhance agents' strategic communication using metaphors. This framework enhances agents' ability to interpret and apply metaphors, improving the overall quality of their interactions. <div>

Abstract: Metaphors are a crucial way for humans to express complex or subtle ideas by comparing one concept to another, often from a different domain. However, many large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and apply metaphors in multi-agent language games, hindering their ability to engage in covert communication and semantic evasion, which are crucial for strategic communication. To address this challenge, we introduce CoMet, a framework that enables LLM-based agents to engage in metaphor processing. CoMet combines a hypothesis-based metaphor reasoner with a metaphor generator that improves through self-reflection and knowledge integration. This enhances the agents' ability to interpret and apply metaphors, improving the strategic and nuanced quality of their interactions. We evaluate CoMet on two multi-agent language games - Undercover and Adversarial Taboo - which emphasize Covert Communication and Semantic Evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMet significantly enhances the agents' ability to communicate strategically using metaphors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as data analysis agents, but existing benchmarks overlook the iterative nature of the field, where experts' decisions evolve with deeper insights of the dataset. To address this, we introduce IDA-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLM agents in multi-round interactive scenarios. Derived from complex Kaggle notebooks, tasks are presented as sequential natural language instructions by an LLM-simulated user. Agent performance is judged by comparing its final numerical output to the human-derived baseline. Initial results show that even state-of-the-art coding agents (like Claude-3.7-thinking) succeed on < 50% of the tasks, highlighting limitations not evident in single-turn tests. This work underscores the need to improve LLMs' multi-round capabilities for building more reliable data analysis agents, highlighting the necessity of achieving a balance between instruction following and reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Large Reasoning Models, information-theoretic, efficiency, Adaptive Think strategy, language model deployment<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper explores the efficiency of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by analyzing the trade-off between reasoning length and semantic efficiency from an information-theoretic perspective. Two metrics, InfoBias and InfoGain, are proposed to measure divergence from ideal reasoning paths and stepwise information contribution. Empirical analyses reveal that longer reasoning chains often exhibit higher information bias and diminishing information gain, particularly for incorrect answers. An entropy-based Adaptive Think strategy is introduced to improve efficiency by dynamically halting reasoning when confidence is high, resulting in a 1.10% increase in average accuracy and a 50.80% reduction in token usage on QwQ-32B benchmark tasks. This strategy demonstrates superior efficiency and reasoning performance compared to the default Vanilla Think approach, highlighting the potential of entropy-based methods in enhancing both accuracy and cost-efficiency in large language model deployment.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: The recent rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has significantly improved multi-step reasoning performance, but often at the cost of generating excessively long reasoning chains. This paper revisits the efficiency of such reasoning processes through an information-theoretic lens, revealing a fundamental trade-off between reasoning length and semantic efficiency. We propose two metrics, InfoBias and InfoGain, to quantify divergence from ideal reasoning paths and stepwise information contribution, respectively. Empirical analyses show that longer reasoning chains tend to exhibit higher information bias and diminishing information gain, especially for incorrect answers. Motivated by these findings, we introduce an entropy-based Adaptive Think strategy that dynamically halts reasoning once confidence is sufficiently high, improving efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. Compared to the Vanilla Think approach (default mode), our strategy yields a 1.10% improvement in average accuracy and a 50.80% reduction in token usage on QwQ-32B across six benchmark tasks spanning diverse reasoning types and difficulty levels, demonstrating superior efficiency and reasoning performance. These results underscore the promise of entropy-based methods for enhancing both accuracy and cost-effiiciency in large language model deployment.

This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called RefSlides, focusing on evaluating multimodal content in presentation slides generated automatically by generative AI. The authors propose a set of metrics to assess intrinsic properties of the content and introduce REFLEX, an evaluation approach that provides scores and feedback based on these metrics. The approach involves generating negative presentation samples with perturbations to fine-tune large language models without requiring ground truth presentations during inference. Automated and human experiments show that REFLEX outperforms traditional heuristic-based and state-of-the-art large language model-based evaluations, generating better scores and explanations. This research advances the field of automated slide generation evaluation and provides a comprehensive approach to assessing the quality and effectiveness of presentation slides. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The generation of presentation slides automatically is an important problem in the era of generative AI. This paper focuses on evaluating multimodal content in presentation slides that can effectively summarize a document and convey concepts to a broad audience. We introduce a benchmark dataset, RefSlides, consisting of human-made high-quality presentations that span various topics. Next, we propose a set of metrics to characterize different intrinsic properties of the content of a presentation and present REFLEX, an evaluation approach that generates scores and actionable feedback for these metrics. We achieve this by generating negative presentation samples with different degrees of metric-specific perturbations and use them to fine-tune LLMs. This reference-free evaluation technique does not require ground truth presentations during inference. Our extensive automated and human experiments demonstrate that our evaluation approach outperforms classical heuristic-based and state-of-the-art large language model-based evaluations in generating scores and explanations.

<div> Framework, Generation, Transformer architectures, Language models, Interpretability

Summary:
Multi_Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory (MSPGT) is a new framework that breaks down generation in large language models into global context, intermediate structure, and local word choices aligned with specific layers in Transformers. Two metrics, attention span thresholds and inter layer mutual information peaks, help identify scale boundaries. Decoder_only models focus more on global and intermediate processing, while encoder_only models prioritize local feature extraction. Interventions show that local changes affect lexical diversity, intermediate changes impact sentence structure, and global changes influence discourse coherence. MSPGT provides a method for interpreting, diagnosing, and controlling language models, bridging the gap between interpretability and capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Large Transformer based language models achieve remarkable performance but remain opaque in how they plan, structure, and realize text. We introduce Multi_Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory (MSPGT), a hierarchical framework that factorizes generation into three semantic scales_global context, intermediate structure, and local word choices and aligns each scale with specific layer ranges in Transformer architectures. To identify scale boundaries, we propose two complementary metrics: attention span thresholds and inter layer mutual information peaks. Across four representative models (GPT-2, BERT, RoBERTa, and T5), these metrics yield stable local/intermediate/global partitions, corroborated by probing tasks and causal interventions. We find that decoder_only models allocate more layers to intermediate and global processing while encoder_only models emphasize local feature extraction. Through targeted interventions, we demonstrate that local scale manipulations primarily influence lexical diversity, intermediate-scale modifications affect sentence structure and length, and global_scale perturbations impact discourse coherence all with statistically significant effects. MSPGT thus offers a unified, architecture-agnostic method for interpreting, diagnosing, and controlling large language models, bridging the gap between mechanistic interpretability and emergent capabilities.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel approach called MetaGen Blended RAG for enhancing the accuracy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in enterprise search settings with domain-specific datasets. The method focuses on improving the retriever for specialized corpora by constructing a metadata generation pipeline and creating a metadata-enriched hybrid index to boost search queries. This approach avoids overfitting and demonstrates effective generalization across domains, achieving 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy on the PubMedQA benchmark for the biomedical domain. These results surpass previous RAG accuracy results without fine-tuning and even outperform larger models like GPT3.5. The approach is also robust and scalable, as demonstrated by evaluations on other Q&amp;A datasets such as SQuAD and NQ. <div>
arXiv:2505.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), its deployment in enterprises for domain-specific datasets remains limited due to poor answer accuracy. These corpora, often shielded behind firewalls in private enterprise knowledge bases, having complex, domain-specific terminology, rarely seen by LLMs during pre-training; exhibit significant semantic variability across domains (like networking, military, or legal, etc.), or even within a single domain like medicine, and thus result in poor context precision for RAG systems. Currently, in such situations, fine-tuning or RAG with fine-tuning is attempted, but these approaches are slow, expensive, and lack generalization for accuracy as the new domain-specific data emerges. We propose an approach for Enterprise Search that focuses on enhancing the retriever for a domain-specific corpus through hybrid query indexes and metadata enrichment. This 'MetaGen Blended RAG' method constructs a metadata generation pipeline using key concepts, topics, and acronyms, and then creates a metadata-enriched hybrid index with boosted search queries. This approach avoids overfitting and generalizes effectively across domains. On the PubMedQA benchmark for the biomedical domain, the proposed method achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all previous RAG accuracy results without fine-tuning and sets a new benchmark for zero-shot results while outperforming much larger models like GPT3.5. The results are even comparable to the best fine-tuned models on this dataset, and we further demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the approach by evaluating it on other Q&amp;A datasets like SQuAD, NQ etc.

This approach addresses the limitations of prompting-based methods and improves generalization and adaptability in medical reasoning tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances such as Chain-of-Thought prompting have significantly improved large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot medical reasoning. However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates. The code will be available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/TAGS.

Summary:<br />
Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in mathematical tasks, often utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). However, RL-trained models tend to generate lengthy reasoning traces, increasing inference costs. Existing methods to control verbosity rely on fixed penalties that are difficult to tune. This study introduces an adaptive reward-shaping approach that allows LLMs to produce concise outputs without compromising accuracy. The method dynamically adjusts the reward trade-off between accuracy and response length based on model performance. It accelerates early-stage length reduction without over-compression later on. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate significant reductions in reasoning length while maintaining accuracy. This approach presents a new path for cost-efficient adaptive reasoning in large-scale language models.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in mathematical tasks, often enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL). However, RL-trained models frequently produce unnecessarily long reasoning traces -- even for simple queries -- leading to increased inference costs and latency. While recent approaches attempt to control verbosity by adding length penalties to the reward function, these methods rely on fixed penalty terms that are hard to tune and cannot adapt as the model's reasoning capability evolves, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose an adaptive reward-shaping method that enables LLMs to "think fast and right" -- producing concise outputs without sacrificing correctness. Our method dynamically adjusts the reward trade-off between accuracy and response length based on model performance: when accuracy is high, the length penalty increases to encourage faster length reduction; when accuracy drops, the penalty is relaxed to preserve correctness. This adaptive reward accelerates early-stage length reduction while avoiding over-compression in later stages. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our approach consistently and dramatically reduces reasoning length while largely maintaining accuracy, offering a new direction for cost-efficient adaptive reasoning in large-scale language models.

<div> align, values, cultural norms, stereotypes, diversity <br />
<br />
In the study, researchers examined how large language models (LLMs) align with cultural values and norms by asking them to reason about narratives from different cultures. The results showed that GPT-4 generated norms that were less culture-specific and sometimes exhibited hidden stereotypes rather than overt ones. While the model attempted to avoid stereotypes, they could easily be recovered from the generated content. This indicates a need for better training and evaluation methods to ensure LLMs serve their diverse user base fairly. By addressing these challenges, future LLMs can better reflect and respect a wide range of cultural backgrounds. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have been demonstrated to align with the values of Western or North American cultures. Prior work predominantly showed this effect through leveraging surveys that directly ask (originally people and now also LLMs) about their values. However, it is hard to believe that LLMs would consistently apply those values in real-world scenarios. To address that, we take a bottom-up approach, asking LLMs to reason about cultural norms in narratives from different cultures. We find that GPT-4 tends to generate norms that, while not necessarily incorrect, are significantly less culture-specific. In addition, while it avoids overtly generating stereotypes, the stereotypical representations of certain cultures are merely hidden rather than suppressed in the model, and such stereotypes can be easily recovered. Addressing these challenges is a crucial step towards developing LLMs that fairly serve their diverse user base.

Abstract: Medical consumer question answering (CQA) is crucial for empowering patients by providing personalized and reliable health information. Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for medical QA, consumer-oriented and multilingual resources, particularly in low-resource languages like Persian, remain sparse. To bridge this gap, we present PerMedCQA, the first Persian-language benchmark for evaluating LLMs on real-world, consumer-generated medical questions. Curated from a large medical QA forum, PerMedCQA contains 68,138 question-answer pairs, refined through careful data cleaning from an initial set of 87,780 raw entries. We evaluate several state-of-the-art multilingual and instruction-tuned LLMs, utilizing MedJudge, a novel rubric-based evaluation framework driven by an LLM grader, validated against expert human annotators. Our results highlight key challenges in multilingual medical QA and provide valuable insights for developing more accurate and context-aware medical assistance systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their practical utility is often limited by persistent issues of hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. Although post-training model editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE (HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i) Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincar\'e embeddings to represent knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) M\"obius-Transformed Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining structural consistency within the hyperbolic manifold, unlike conventional Euclidean updates that distort relational distances; and (iii) Dual Stabilization, which combines gradient masking and periodic GNN parameter resetting to prevent catastrophic forgetting by focusing updates on critical parameters and preserving long-term knowledge. Experiments on CounterFact, CounterFact+, and MQuAKE with GPT-J and GPT2-XL demonstrate that HYPE significantly enhances edit stability, factual accuracy, and multi-hop reasoning.

Summary:
Modular frameworks are developed to improve cross-lingual transfer for large language models that struggle with lower-resource languages. The study validates the importance of distinct subsets of model parameters for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities. Modular methods, such as freezing parameters and model merging, successfully enhance performance across languages and models in fine-tuning. The fine-tuning of separate language and math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping proves to be the most effective approach. Recent works on task vectors' linearity and reverting less useful fine-tuning updates after training are explored as potential explanations for the results. The study demonstrates the impact of modular approaches in enhancing LLM performance in lower-resource languages. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce. Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them from the start.

Summary:
Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries, and recent advancements with large language models (LLMs) have improved this task. Schema linking is crucial in Text-to-SQL systems to reduce prompt size and enhance model focus. This study introduces a training-free schema linking method that constructs a schema graph based on foreign key relations. It utilizes a single prompt to extract source and destination tables from the user query, employing path-finding algorithms to identify the optimal sequence of tables and columns for joining. Despite its simplicity and scalability, the approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the BIRD benchmark, surpassing previous complex LLM-based methods. Ablation studies explore the precision-recall trade-off, while the execution accuracy of the schema filtering method is evaluated across different model sizes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into executable SQL queries, and recent progress with large language models (LLMs) has driven substantial improvements in this task. Schema linking remains a critical component in Text-to-SQL systems, reducing prompt size for models with narrow context windows and sharpening model focus even when the entire schema fits. We present a zero-shot, training-free schema linking approach that first constructs a schema graph based on foreign key relations, then uses a single prompt to Gemini 2.5 Flash to extract source and destination tables from the user query, followed by applying classical path-finding algorithms and post-processing to identify the optimal sequence of tables and columns that should be joined, enabling the LLM to generate more accurate SQL queries. Despite being simple, cost-effective, and highly scalable, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the BIRD benchmark, outperforming previous specialized, fine-tuned, and complex multi-step LLM-based approaches. We conduct detailed ablation studies to examine the precision-recall trade-off in our framework. Additionally, we evaluate the execution accuracy of our schema filtering method compared to other approaches across various model sizes.

Summary: 
Command-line interfaces (CLIs) are used for system administration, and researchers have used pre-trained language models to simulate interactions in high-risk environments. Existing datasets lack crucial data on CLI interactions, so a new Shell Input-Output Environment (ShIOEnv) framework was developed to generate realistic CLI interactions. By using a Markov Decision Process and context-free grammar derived from man pages, ShIOEnv efficiently builds command sequences and executes them to gather execution data. Different sampling strategies were explored, including random and PPO-optimized sampling of action spaces, to create high-quality datasets for behavioral modeling. CodeT5 was fine-tuned using policy-generated datasets from ShIOEnv, resulting in significant improvements in BLEU-4 scores. The ShIOEnv environment and curated datasets are released for future research purposes.

Abstract: Command-line interfaces (CLIs) provide structured textual environments for system administration. Explorations have been performed using pre-trained language models (PLMs) to simulate these environments for safe interaction in high-risk environments. However, their use has been constrained to frozen, large parameter models like GPT. For smaller architectures to reach a similar level of believability, a rich dataset of CLI interactions is required. Existing public datasets focus on mapping natural-language tasks to commands, omitting crucial execution data such as exit codes, outputs, and environmental side effects, limiting their usability for behavioral modeling. We introduce a Shell Input -Output Environment (ShIOEnv), which casts command construction as a Markov Decision Process whose state is the partially built sequence and whose actions append arguments. After each action, ShIOEnv executes the candidate and returns its exit status, output, and progress toward a minimal-length behavioral objective. Due to the intractable nature of the combinatorial argument state-action space, we derive a context-free grammar from man pages to mask invalid arguments from being emitted. We explore random and proximal-policy optimization (PPO)-optimized sampling of unrestricted and grammar-masked action spaces to produce four exploration strategies. We observed that grammar masking and PPO significantly improve sample efficiency to produce a higher quality dataset (maximizing the number of arguments while minimizing redundancies). Policy-generated datasets of shell input-output behavior pairs are used to fine-tune CodeT5, where we observe 85% improvements in BLEU-4 when constraining the action space to grammar productions with an additional 26% improvement when applying PPO. The ShIOEnv environment and curated command behavior datasets are released for use in future research.

Abstract: Enhancing the linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to include low-resource languages is a critical research area. Current research directions predominantly rely on synthetic data generated by translating English corpora, which, while demonstrating promising linguistic understanding and translation abilities, often results in models aligned with source language culture. These models frequently fail to represent the cultural heritage and values of local communities. This work proposes a methodology to create both synthetic and retrieval-based pre-training data tailored to a specific community, considering its (i) language, (ii) cultural heritage, and (iii) cultural values. We demonstrate our methodology using Egyptian and Moroccan dialects as testbeds, chosen for their linguistic and cultural richness and current underrepresentation in LLMs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop NileChat, a 3B parameter LLM adapted for Egyptian and Moroccan communities, incorporating their language, cultural heritage, and values. Our results on various understanding, translation, and cultural and values alignment benchmarks show that NileChat outperforms existing Arabic-aware LLMs of similar size and performs on par with larger models. We share our methods, data, and models with the community to promote the inclusion and coverage of more diverse communities in LLM development.

arXiv:2505.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce DanmakuTPPBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to advance multi-modal Temporal Point Process (TPP) modeling in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). While TPPs have been widely studied for modeling temporal event sequences, existing datasets are predominantly unimodal, hindering progress in models that require joint reasoning over temporal, textual, and visual information. To address this gap, DanmakuTPPBench comprises two complementary components: (1) DanmakuTPP-Events, a novel dataset derived from the Bilibili video platform, where user-generated bullet comments (Danmaku) naturally form multi-modal events annotated with precise timestamps, rich textual content, and corresponding video frames; (2) DanmakuTPP-QA, a challenging question-answering dataset constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline powered by state-of-the-art LLMs and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), targeting complex temporal-textual-visual reasoning. We conduct extensive evaluations using both classical TPP models and recent MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps and limitations in current methods' ability to model multi-modal event dynamics. Our benchmark establishes strong baselines and calls for further integration of TPP modeling into the multi-modal language modeling landscape.

Summary: 
The article introduces a method to train small language models (SLMs) to perform long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Large reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 excel at generating long CoTs, but it is challenging for SLMs due to their limited capacity. The proposed method involves pruning unnecessary steps in the CoT and using an on-policy method to curate valid and useful training data for the SLM. This enables SLMs to efficiently learn long CoT reasoning while maintaining competitive performance. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that the method effectively distills long CoT reasoning into SLMs, reducing redundant steps. <div>

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 exhibit strong complex problems solving abilities by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning steps. It is challenging to directly train small language models (SLMs) to emerge long CoT. Thus, distillation becomes a practical method to enable SLMs for such reasoning ability. However, the long CoT often contains a lot of redundant contents (e.g., overthinking steps) which may make SLMs hard to learn considering their relatively poor capacity and generalization. To address this issue, we propose a simple-yet-effective method to prune unnecessary steps in long CoT, and then employ an on-policy method for the SLM itself to curate valid and useful long CoT training data. In this way, SLMs can effectively learn efficient long CoT reasoning and preserve competitive performance at the same time. Experimental results across a series of mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling long CoT reasoning ability into SLMs which maintains the competitive performance but significantly reduces generating redundant reasoning steps.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising technique to enhance the quality and relevance of responses generated by large language models. While recent advancements have mainly focused on improving RAG for text-based queries, RAG on multi-modal documents containing both texts and images has not been fully explored. Especially when fine-tuning does not work. This paper proposes BRIT, a novel multi-modal RAG framework that effectively unifies various text-image connections in the document into a multi-modal graph and retrieves the texts and images as a query-specific sub-graph. By traversing both image-to-text and text-to-image paths in the graph, BRIT retrieve not only directly query-relevant images and texts but also further relevant contents to answering complex cross-modal multi-hop questions. To evaluate the effectiveness of BRIT, we introduce MM-RAG test set specifically designed for multi-modal question answering tasks that require to understand the text-image relations. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of BRIT, highlighting its ability to handle cross-modal questions on the multi-modal documents.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but may not always be correct, particularly in factuality evaluation. Existing factuality systems are not well-suited for evaluating medical answers, as they are typically tested on objective texts rather than the diverse and subjective nature of medical responses. The new MedScore approach aims to decompose medical answers into condition-aware valid facts, extracting more accurate information and reducing hallucination. The factuality score varies based on the decomposition method, verification corpus, and LLM used. Customizing each step is essential for reliable factuality evaluation, especially in the medical domain where incorrect information could be harmful. <div>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent and convincing responses, they are not necessarily correct. This is especially apparent in the popular decompose-then-verify factuality evaluation pipeline, where LLMs evaluate generations by decomposing the generations into individual, valid claims. Factuality evaluation is especially important for medical answers, since incorrect medical information could seriously harm the patient. However, existing factuality systems are a poor match for the medical domain, as they are typically only evaluated on objective, entity-centric, formulaic texts such as biographies and historical topics. This differs from condition-dependent, conversational, hypothetical, sentence-structure diverse, and subjective medical answers, which makes decomposition into valid facts challenging. We propose MedScore, a new approach to decomposing medical answers into condition-aware valid facts. Our method extracts up to three times more valid facts than existing methods, reducing hallucination and vague references, and retaining condition-dependency in facts. The resulting factuality score significantly varies by decomposition method, verification corpus, and used backbone LLM, highlighting the importance of customizing each step for reliable factuality evaluation.

Summary:
- The study focuses on integrating latent reasoning with large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL).
- A hybrid reasoning policy optimization (HRPO) approach is introduced to combine the strengths of both latent reasoning and LLMs.
- HRPO leverages prior hidden states and token embeddings in a learnable manner to improve reasoning capabilities.
- The approach introduces stochasticity via token sampling, enabling RL optimization without the need for chain-of-thought trajectories.
- Extensive evaluations demonstrate that HRPO outperforms existing methods in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks, while maintaining interpretability and exhibiting novel behaviors like cross-lingual patterns. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced latent reasoning as a promising alternative to autoregressive reasoning. By performing internal computation with hidden states from previous steps, latent reasoning benefit from more informative features rather than sampling a discrete chain-of-thought (CoT) path. Yet latent reasoning approaches are often incompatible with LLMs, as their continuous paradigm conflicts with the discrete nature of autoregressive generation. Moreover, these methods rely on CoT traces for training and thus fail to exploit the inherent reasoning patterns of LLMs. In this work, we explore latent reasoning by leveraging the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we introduce hybrid reasoning policy optimization (HRPO), an RL-based hybrid latent reasoning approach that (1) integrates prior hidden states into sampled tokens with a learnable gating mechanism, and (2) initializes training with predominantly token embeddings while progressively incorporating more hidden features. This design maintains LLMs' generative capabilities and incentivizes hybrid reasoning using both discrete and continuous representations. In addition, the hybrid HRPO introduces stochasticity into latent reasoning via token sampling, thereby enabling RL-based optimization without requiring CoT trajectories. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks show that HRPO outperforms prior methods in both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks. Furthermore, HRPO-trained LLMs remain interpretable and exhibit intriguing behaviors like cross-lingual patterns and shorter completion lengths, highlighting the potential of our RL-based approach and offer insights for future work in latent reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion Language Models, Anchored Diffusion Language Model, test perplexity, zero-shot generalization, MAUVE score

Summary:
The article introduces the Anchored Diffusion Language Model (ADLM) to address the performance gap between Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) and autoregressive (AR) models. ADLM predicts distributions over important tokens before predicting the likelihoods of missing tokens, leading to significant improvements in test perplexity on LM1B and OpenWebText datasets. It achieves up to a 25.4% increase over prior DLMs and narrows the gap with strong AR baselines. ADLM also excels in zero-shot generalization across seven benchmarks and surpasses AR models in MAUVE score, marking the first time a DLM outperforms an AR model in generating human-like text. Theoretically, the Anchored Negative Evidence Lower Bound (ANELBO) objective is derived to show that anchoring enhances sample complexity and likelihood modeling. Additionally, anchoring is shown to boost performance in AR models and improve reasoning in math and logic tasks, outperforming existing chain-of-thought approaches.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) promise parallel generation and bidirectional context, yet they underperform autoregressive (AR) models in both likelihood modeling and generated text quality. We identify that this performance gap arises when important tokens (e.g., key words or low-frequency words that anchor a sentence) are masked early in the forward process, limiting contextual information for accurate reconstruction. To address this, we introduce the Anchored Diffusion Language Model (ADLM), a novel two-stage framework that first predicts distributions over important tokens via an anchor network, and then predicts the likelihoods of missing tokens conditioned on the anchored predictions. ADLM significantly improves test perplexity on LM1B and OpenWebText, achieving up to 25.4% gains over prior DLMs, and narrows the gap with strong AR baselines. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot generalization across seven benchmarks and surpasses AR models in MAUVE score, which marks the first time a DLM generates better human-like text than an AR model. Theoretically, we derive an Anchored Negative Evidence Lower Bound (ANELBO) objective and show that anchoring improves sample complexity and likelihood modeling. Beyond diffusion, anchoring boosts performance in AR models and enhances reasoning in math and logic tasks, outperforming existing chain-of-thought approaches

Summary: 
This study evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) in 10 Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages, uncovering cultural biases linked to purdah and patriarchy.

Abstract: Evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) often overlook intersectional and culturally specific biases, particularly in underrepresented multilingual regions like South Asia. This work addresses these gaps by conducting a multilingual and intersectional analysis of LLM outputs across 10 Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages, identifying how cultural stigmas influenced by purdah and patriarchy are reinforced in generative tasks. We construct a culturally grounded bias lexicon capturing previously unexplored intersectional dimensions including gender, religion, marital status, and number of children. We use our lexicon to quantify intersectional bias and the effectiveness of self-debiasing in open-ended generations (e.g., storytelling, hobbies, and to-do lists), where bias manifests subtly and remains largely unexamined in multilingual contexts. Finally, we evaluate two self-debiasing strategies (simple and complex prompts) to measure their effectiveness in reducing culturally specific bias in Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages. Our approach offers a nuanced lens into cultural bias by introducing a novel bias lexicon and evaluation framework that extends beyond Eurocentric or small-scale multilingual settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely explored for automated scoring in low-stakes assessment to facilitate learning and instruction. Empirical evidence related to which LLM produces the most reliable scores and induces least rater effects needs to be collected before the use of LLMs for automated scoring in practice. This study compared ten LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 4o, OpenAI o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0, as well as DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek R1) with human expert raters in scoring two types of writing tasks. The accuracy of the holistic and analytic scores from LLMs compared with human raters was evaluated in terms of Quadratic Weighted Kappa. Intra-rater consistency across prompts was compared in terms of Cronbach Alpha. Rater effects of LLMs were evaluated and compared with human raters using the Many-Facet Rasch model. The results in general supported the use of ChatGPT 4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet with high scoring accuracy, better rater reliability, and less rater effects.

<div> alternatives, language models, pragmatic understanding, training stages, speaker intentions

Summary:
The article discusses how large language models (LLMs) acquire pragmatic competence during training. The ALTPRAG dataset is introduced to evaluate LLMs' ability to infer nuanced speaker intentions based on pragmatic alternatives. The study evaluates 22 LLMs at different training stages: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization. Results show that even base models exhibit sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves with model and data scale. Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) contribute to further gains in cognitive-pragmatic reasoning. These findings indicate that pragmatic competence is an emergent property of LLM training, offering insights for aligning models with human communicative norms. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emerging capabilities in social intelligence tasks, including implicature resolution (Sravanthi et al. (2024)) and theory-of-mind reasoning (Shapira et al. (2024)), both of which require substantial pragmatic understanding. However, how LLMs acquire this competence throughout the training process remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce ALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of alternatives, designed to evaluate whether LLMs at different training stages can accurately infer nuanced speaker intentions. Each instance pairs two contextually appropriate but pragmatically distinct continuations, enabling fine-grained assessment of both pragmatic interpretation and contrastive reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across key training stages: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to examine the development of pragmatic competence. Our results show that even base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves consistently with increases in model and data scale. Additionally, SFT and RLHF contribute further gains, particularly in cognitive-pragmatic reasoning. These findings highlight pragmatic competence as an emergent and compositional property of LLM training and offer new insights for aligning models with human communicative norms.

<div> Keywords: pre-trained language models, sequence modeling architectures, base capabilities, self-attention mechanism, architecture design 

Summary: 
This article investigates how different sequence modeling architectures impact the base capabilities of pre-trained language models. The study introduces a limited domain pre-training setting with out-of-distribution testing to reveal differences in base capabilities among architectures early on. Stateful sequence modeling architectures are found to have lower base capabilities compared to the Transformer model. The analysis identifies the importance of full-sequence arbitrary selection capability in maintaining base capabilities. Experimental validation using simple architectures confirms the proposed design principle, with potential implications for future architecture improvements and novel designs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models represented by the Transformer have been proven to possess strong base capabilities, and the representative self-attention mechanism in the Transformer has become a classic in sequence modeling architectures. Different from the work of proposing sequence modeling architecture to improve the efficiency of attention mechanism, this work focuses on the impact of sequence modeling architectures on base capabilities. Specifically, our concern is: How exactly do sequence modeling architectures affect the base capabilities of pre-trained language models? In this work, we first point out that the mixed domain pre-training setting commonly adopted in existing architecture design works fails to adequately reveal the differences in base capabilities among various architectures. To address this, we propose a limited domain pre-training setting with out-of-distribution testing, which successfully uncovers significant differences in base capabilities among architectures at an early stage. Next, we analyze the base capabilities of stateful sequence modeling architectures, and find that they exhibit significant degradation in base capabilities compared to the Transformer. Then, through a series of architecture component analysis, we summarize a key architecture design principle: A sequence modeling architecture need possess full-sequence arbitrary selection capability to avoid degradation in base capabilities. Finally, we empirically validate this principle using an extremely simple Top-1 element selection architecture and further generalize it to a more practical Top-1 chunk selection architecture. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed sequence modeling architecture design principle and suggest that our work can serve as a valuable reference for future architecture improvements and novel designs.

Summary:
MetaTextGrad introduces a meta-optimizer aimed at enhancing existing optimizers by aligning them to specific tasks. It consists of a meta prompt optimizer and a meta structure optimizer, which work together to improve performance across various benchmarks. The approach focuses on optimizing optimizers built on language models, which are often manually designed and not optimized themselves. By tailoring existing optimizers to specific tasks, MetaTextGrad achieves an average absolute performance improvement of up to 6% compared to baseline methods. This meta-optimization approach addresses the challenge of general-purpose optimizers not being optimized for specific tasks, leading to enhanced performance in learning algorithms and optimization tasks. <div>
arXiv:2505.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in learning algorithms, evaluations, and optimization tasks. Recent studies have shown that using LLM-based optimizers to automatically optimize model prompts, demonstrations, predictions themselves, or other components can significantly enhance the performance of AI systems, as demonstrated by frameworks such as DSPy and TextGrad. However, optimizers built on language models themselves are usually designed by humans with manual design choices; optimizers themselves are not optimized. Moreover, these optimizers are general purpose by design, to be useful to a broad audience, and are not tailored for specific tasks. To address these challenges, we propose metaTextGrad, which focuses on designing a meta-optimizer to further enhance existing optimizers and align them to be good optimizers for a given task. Our approach consists of two key components: a meta prompt optimizer and a meta structure optimizer. The combination of these two significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an average absolute performance improvement of up to 6% compared to the best baseline.

Abstract: Process mining aims to discover, monitor and optimize the actual behaviors of real processes. While prior work has mainly focused on extracting procedural action flows from instructional texts, rule flows embedded in business documents remain underexplored. To this end, we introduce a novel annotated Chinese dataset, \textbf{BPRF}, which contains 50 business process documents with 326 explicitly labeled business rules across multiple domains. Each rule is represented as a  pair, and we annotate logical dependencies between rules (sequential, conditional, or parallel). We also propose \textbf{ExIde}, a framework for automatic business rule extraction and dependency relationship identification using large language models (LLMs). We evaluate ExIde using 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on the BPRF dataset, benchmarking performance on both rule extraction and dependency classification tasks of current LLMs. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ExIde in extracting structured business rules and analyzing their interdependencies for current SOTA LLMs, paving the way for more automated and interpretable business process automation.

<div> Keywords: cross-prompt automated essay scoring, adaptation, parameter merging, Prior-encoded Information Maximization, Bayesian optimization

Summary:
The article introduces a source-free adaptation approach for cross-prompt automated essay scoring (AES), addressing privacy concerns and performance optimization issues. The proposed method selectively merges individually trained source models' parameters using linear combinations of task vectors. To optimize the combination's coefficients, Prior-encoded Information Maximization (PIM), an unsupervised objective, is employed, enhanced by Bayesian optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach outperforms joint training on all sources, maintains robustness, and excels in scenarios with severe distribution shifts. The method is computationally efficient, offering a promising solution for AES adaptation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in cross-prompt automated essay scoring (AES) typically train models jointly on all source prompts, often requiring additional access to unlabeled target prompt essays simultaneously. However, using all sources is suboptimal in our pilot study, and re-accessing source datasets during adaptation raises privacy concerns. We propose a source-free adaptation approach that selectively merges individually trained source models' parameters instead of datasets. In particular, we simulate joint training through linear combinations of task vectors -- the parameter updates from fine-tuning. To optimize the combination's coefficients, we propose Prior-encoded Information Maximization (PIM), an unsupervised objective which promotes the model's score discriminability regularized by priors pre-computed from the sources. We employ Bayesian optimization as an efficient optimizer of PIM. Experimental results with LLMs on in-dataset and cross-dataset adaptation show that our method (1) consistently outperforms training jointly on all sources, (2) maintains superior robustness compared to other merging methods, (3) excels under severe distribution shifts where recent leading cross-prompt methods struggle, all while retaining computational efficiency.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in supporting human problem-solving through impressive reasoning capabilities. However, the impact of misinformation on LLM performance has not been thoroughly explored. This study focuses on mathematical reasoning and analyzes how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final answers in LLMs. It was found that LLMs struggle to correct misinformation even with explicit instructions, leading to significant drops in accuracy. Early-stage corrections were identified as the most effective way to reduce misinformation propagation, with fine-tuning on synthesized data showing improvement in reasoning factuality. This work provides valuable insights on mitigating misinformation propagation in LLMs, highlighting the importance of addressing misinformation early in the reasoning process.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning, positioning them as promising tools for supporting human problem-solving. However, what happens when their performance is affected by misinformation, i.e., incorrect inputs introduced by users due to oversights or gaps in knowledge? Such misinformation is prevalent in real-world interactions with LLMs, yet how it propagates within LLMs' reasoning process remains underexplored. Focusing on mathematical reasoning, we present a comprehensive analysis of how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final answers. We also examine how effectively LLMs can correct misinformation when explicitly instructed to do so. Even with explicit instructions, LLMs succeed less than half the time in rectifying misinformation, despite possessing correct internal knowledge, leading to significant accuracy drops (10.02% - 72.20%). Further analysis shows that applying factual corrections early in the reasoning process most effectively reduces misinformation propagation, and fine-tuning on synthesized data with early-stage corrections significantly improves reasoning factuality. Our work offers a practical approach to mitigating misinformation propagation.

Intent detection has evolved as a crucial mechanism in safeguarding large language models (LLMs). This study explores the vulnerability of intent-aware guardrails in LLMs and introduces a two-stage framework called IntentPrompt. The framework transforms harmful inquiries into structured outlines and reframes them into declarative-style narratives to enhance jailbreak success for red-teaming purposes. Extensive experiments show that IntentPrompt consistently outperforms cutting-edge jailbreak methods and evades advanced Intent Analysis and Chain-of-Thought-based defenses. The "FSTR+SPIN" variant of the framework achieves high attack success rates against CoT-based defenses on the o1 model and the GPT-4o model under IA-based defenses. These results expose a critical weakness in LLMs' safety mechanisms and indicate that intent manipulation poses a significant challenge to content moderation guardrails.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Intent detection, a core component of natural language understanding, has considerably evolved as a crucial mechanism in safeguarding large language models (LLMs). While prior work has applied intent detection to enhance LLMs' moderation guardrails, showing a significant success against content-level jailbreaks, the robustness of these intent-aware guardrails under malicious manipulations remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of intent-aware guardrails and demonstrate that LLMs exhibit implicit intent detection capabilities. We propose a two-stage intent-based prompt-refinement framework, IntentPrompt, that first transforms harmful inquiries into structured outlines and further reframes them into declarative-style narratives by iteratively optimizing prompts via feedback loops to enhance jailbreak success for red-teaming purposes. Extensive experiments across four public benchmarks and various black-box LLMs indicate that our framework consistently outperforms several cutting-edge jailbreak methods and evades even advanced Intent Analysis (IA) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based defenses. Specifically, our "FSTR+SPIN" variant achieves attack success rates ranging from 88.25% to 96.54% against CoT-based defenses on the o1 model, and from 86.75% to 97.12% on the GPT-4o model under IA-based defenses. These findings highlight a critical weakness in LLMs' safety mechanisms and suggest that intent manipulation poses a growing challenge to content moderation guardrails.

Summary: 
The research introduces a new approach to assessing the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with cross-cultural cognition by extending the human-centered word association test (WAT). The proposed CultureSteer method aims to mitigate culture preference by guiding semantic representations toward culturally specific spaces. The study highlights a significant bias of current LLMs towards Western cultural schemas at the word association level, with the newly developed model showing improved cross-cultural alignment. Experiments demonstrate that CultureSteer surpasses prompt-based methods in capturing diverse semantic associations and is effective in fostering cognitive alignment across cultures. This innovative methodological paradigm contributes to enhancing cultural awareness in LLMs and advancing the development of more inclusive language technologies.

Abstract: The human-centered word association test (WAT) serves as a cognitive proxy, revealing sociocultural variations through lexical-semantic patterns. We extend this test into an LLM-adaptive, free-relation task to assess the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with cross-cultural cognition. To mitigate the culture preference, we propose CultureSteer, an innovative approach that integrates a culture-aware steering mechanism to guide semantic representations toward culturally specific spaces. Experiments show that current LLMs exhibit significant bias toward Western cultural (notably in American) schemas at the word association level. In contrast, our model substantially improves cross-cultural alignment, surpassing prompt-based methods in capturing diverse semantic associations. Further validation on culture-sensitive downstream tasks confirms its efficacy in fostering cognitive alignment across cultures. This work contributes a novel methodological paradigm for enhancing cultural awareness in LLMs, advancing the development of more inclusive language technologies.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, external knowledge, hallucinations, Multi-Agent Debate, factual accuracy

Summary:
Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG) is introduced as a solution to the issue of misleading information in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. In DRAG, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms are utilized in both the retrieval and generation stages to ensure factual reliability and reduce hallucinations. Structured debates among proponents, opponents, and judges are applied in the retrieval process to refine quality and enhance factual accuracy. In the generation stage, DRAG incorporates asymmetric information roles and adversarial debates to improve reasoning robustness and mitigate inconsistencies. Evaluations across various tasks demonstrate that DRAG enhances retrieval reliability, reduces hallucinations induced by RAG, and significantly boosts overall factual accuracy. The code for DRAG is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/Huenao/Debate-Augmented-RAG.

<br /><br />Summary: 
- DRAG integrates Multi-Agent Debate mechanisms in both retrieval and generation stages.
- Structured debates refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability.
- Asymmetric information roles and adversarial debates enhance reasoning robustness in generation.
- Evaluations show improved retrieval reliability, reduced hallucinations, and enhanced factual accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external knowledge, yet it introduces a critical issue: erroneous or biased retrieval can mislead generation, compounding hallucinations, a phenomenon we term Hallucination on Hallucination. To address this, we propose Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms into both retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies. Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances overall factual accuracy.

<div> Localization; Retention; Unlearning; Safety alignment; Large language models

Summary:
Constrained Knowledge Unlearning (CKU) is introduced as a safety alignment strategy for large language models (LLMs) to prevent jailbreak attacks. CKU focuses on two objectives: localizing and retaining valuable knowledge, and unlearning harmful knowledge.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in safety alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms have not fully deleted harmful knowledge in LLMs, which allows such attacks to bypass safeguards and produce harmful outputs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel safety alignment strategy, Constrained Knowledge Unlearning (CKU), which focuses on two primary objectives: knowledge localization and retention, and unlearning harmful knowledge. CKU works by scoring neurons in specific multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers to identify a subset U of neurons associated with useful knowledge. During the unlearning process, CKU prunes the gradients of neurons in U to preserve valuable knowledge while effectively mitigating harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that CKU significantly enhances model safety without compromising overall performance, offering a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing methods. Additionally, our analysis of neuron knowledge sensitivity across various MLP layers provides valuable insights into the mechanics of safety alignment and model knowledge editing.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the Debate-to-Detect (D2D) framework, a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) approach for misinformation detection. D2D leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and assigns domain-specific profiles to agents, engaging in a structured adversarial debate process. It includes stages like Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment, assesses claims across dimensions like Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o show significant improvements in detecting fake news over baseline methods. D2D enhances decision transparency by iteratively refining evidence, moving beyond traditional binary classification methods. The code for D2D will be open-sourced in the future, marking a significant step towards robust and interpretable misinformation detection. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two fakenews datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards robust and interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be open-sourced in a future release.

<br /><br />Summary:
The paper introduces Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to generalize across multiple modalities. The model is designed to reduce the costs associated with manual annotations by utilizing structured textual reasoning explanations for decision-making patterns. Flex-Judge outperforms state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators, even when trained on significantly fewer text data. It demonstrates competitive or superior performance in diverse modalities, including molecules, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce. The framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-heavy approaches, advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge. <div>

Abstract: Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

<div> Keyword: Large Language Models, Key-Value Cache, Quantization, Long-CoT reasoning, Progressive Mixed-Precision

Summary:<br />
- Large Language Models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning face memory overhead due to Key-Value (KV) Cache.
- Post-training KV Cache quantization helps compress memory but existing methods fail to fully leverage memory, leading to large error.
- Short-context calibration with Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) causes performance loss in long-CoT LLMs.
- Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization (PM-KVQ) gradually reduces bit-width in each block and allocates higher bit-width to sensitive blocks.
- Calibration strategy with positional interpolation improves data distribution approximation without additional overhead.
<br /><br />Summary: <br />Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization (PM-KVQ) is proposed to enhance the performance of long-CoT Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing cumulative error and improving data distribution calibration. By progressively lowering the bit-width of KV Cache and assigning higher precision to sensitive transformer blocks, PM-KVQ effectively compresses memory overhead. Additionally, a novel calibration strategy with positional interpolation extends the calibration length without extra memory cost, resulting in improved reasoning benchmark performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory budget. <div>

Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in developing reasoning-capable Large Language Models (LLMs) through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. However, this long-CoT reasoning process imposes substantial memory overhead due to the large Key-Value (KV) Cache memory overhead. Post-training KV Cache quantization has emerged as a promising compression technique and has been extensively studied in short-context scenarios. However, directly applying existing methods to long-CoT LLMs causes significant performance degradation due to the following two reasons: (1) Large cumulative error: Existing methods fail to adequately leverage available memory, and they directly quantize the KV Cache during each decoding step, leading to large cumulative quantization error. (2) Short-context calibration: Due to Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE), the use of short-context data during calibration fails to account for the distribution of less frequent channels in the Key Cache, resulting in performance loss. We propose Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization (PM-KVQ) for long-CoT LLMs to address the above issues in two folds: (1) To reduce cumulative error, we design a progressive quantization strategy to gradually lower the bit-width of KV Cache in each block. Then, we propose block-wise memory allocation to assign a higher bit-width to more sensitive transformer blocks. (2) To increase the calibration length without additional overhead, we propose a new calibration strategy with positional interpolation that leverages short calibration data with positional interpolation to approximate the data distribution of long-context data. Extensive experiments on 7B-70B long-CoT LLMs show that PM-KVQ improves reasoning benchmark performance by up to 8% over SOTA baselines under the same memory budget.

Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals, the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this, we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual approaches for lyrics translation.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, medical consultation, symptom inquiry, disease diagnosis, decision optimization

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in generalization and reasoning, making them suitable for complex decision-making tasks like medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often struggle to effectively handle the dual nature of MC, which involves symptom inquiry and disease diagnosis. To address this issue, a new framework called DDO (Dual-Decision Optimization) is proposed. DDO decouples and optimizes the two sub-tasks independently through a collaborative multi-agent workflow. Experimental results on real-world MC datasets demonstrate that DDO outperforms existing LLM-based approaches and rivals state-of-the-art generation-based methods. This showcases the effectiveness of DDO in enhancing the performance of LLMs in the task of medical consultation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization and reasoning abilities, making them well-suited for complex decision-making tasks such as medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to capture the dual nature of MC, which entails two distinct sub-tasks: symptom inquiry, a sequential decision-making process, and disease diagnosis, a classification problem. This mismatch often results in ineffective symptom inquiry and unreliable disease diagnosis. To address this, we propose \textbf{DDO}, a novel LLM-based framework that performs \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{O}ptimization by decoupling and independently optimizing the the two sub-tasks through a collaborative multi-agent workflow. Experiments on three real-world MC datasets show that DDO consistently outperforms existing LLM-based approaches and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art generation-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in the MC task.

Abstract: In this work, we provide DZEN, a dataset of parallel Dzongkha and English test questions for Bhutanese middle and high school students. The over 5K questions in our collection span a variety of scientific topics and include factual, application, and reasoning-based questions. We use our parallel dataset to test a number of Large Language Models (LLMs) and find a significant performance difference between the models in English and Dzongkha. We also look at different prompting strategies and discover that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting works well for reasoning questions but less well for factual ones. We also find that adding English translations enhances the precision of Dzongkha question responses. Our results point to exciting avenues for further study to improve LLM performance in Dzongkha and, more generally, in low-resource languages.

<br />
Summary:
Chunk-wise training (CWT) addresses issues in long rationale training for small language models (SLM) by dividing rationales into coherent chunks. This approach improves training by focusing on semantically coherent chunks for each iteration, allowing the SLM to learn core reasoning tokens more effectively. Skip-thinking training (STT) builds on CWT to increase reasoning speed by automatically skipping non-reasoning chunks. This method maintains accuracy while speeding up the SLM response time. The combination of CWT and STT enhances the performance of SLMs in various reasoning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2505.18642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation allows a large language model (LLM) to guide a small language model (SLM) in reasoning tasks. Existing methods train the SLM to learn the long rationale in one iteration, resulting in two issues: 1) Long rationales lead to a large token-level batch size during training, making gradients of core reasoning tokens (i.e., the token will directly affect the correctness of subsequent reasoning) over-smoothed as they contribute a tiny fraction of the rationale. As a result, the SLM converges to sharp minima where it fails to grasp the reasoning logic. 2) The response is slow, as the SLM must generate a long rationale before reaching the answer. Therefore, we propose chunk-wise training (CWT), which uses a heuristic search to divide the rationale into internal semantically coherent chunks and focuses SLM on learning from only one chunk per iteration. In this way, CWT naturally isolates non-reasoning chunks that do not involve the core reasoning token (e.g., summary and transitional chunks) from the SLM learning for reasoning chunks, making the fraction of the core reasoning token increase in the corresponding iteration. Based on CWT, skip-thinking training (STT) is proposed. STT makes the SLM automatically skip non-reasoning medium chunks to reach the answer, improving reasoning speed while maintaining accuracy. We validate our approach on a variety of SLMs and multiple reasoning tasks.

<div> word embeddings, analogy structure, co-occurrence probability, generative model, semantic attributes
Summary:
The article discusses how word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe exhibit a linear analogy structure, such as king - man + woman = queen. The theoretical origin of this structure is unclear, but it is observed that it emerges from the top eigenvectors of the co-occurrence probability matrix. The analogy structure strengthens with more eigenvectors and is enhanced using log probability. A generative model based on binary semantic attributes accurately reproduces this linear analogy structure and explains the observed phenomena. The model provides insights into the role of each embedding dimension and is robust to noise. It aligns well with co-occurrence statistics from Wikipedia and the analogy benchmark established by Mikolov et al. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} - W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix $M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and (iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation (e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties (i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising cornerstone for the development of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, ensuring the robustness of LLMs remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges and advance the field, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of current studies in this area. First, we systematically examine the nature of robustness in LLMs, including its conceptual foundations, the importance of consistent performance across diverse inputs, and the implications of failure modes in real-world applications. Next, we analyze the sources of non-robustness, categorizing intrinsic model limitations, data-driven vulnerabilities, and external adversarial factors that compromise reliability. Following this, we review state-of-the-art mitigation strategies, and then we discuss widely adopted benchmarks, emerging metrics, and persistent gaps in assessing real-world reliability. Finally, we synthesize findings from existing surveys and interdisciplinary studies to highlight trends, unresolved issues, and pathways for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet their cross-lingual performance consistency remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel methodology for efficiently identifying inherent cross-lingual weaknesses in LLMs. Our approach leverages beam search and LLM-based simulation to generate bilingual question pairs that expose performance discrepancies between English and target languages. We construct a new dataset of over 6,000 bilingual pairs across 16 languages using this methodology, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing weaknesses even in state-of-the-art models. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our method precisely and cost-effectively pinpoints cross-lingual weaknesses, consistently revealing over 50\% accuracy drops in target languages across a wide range of models. Moreover, further experiments investigate the relationship between linguistic similarity and cross-lingual weaknesses, revealing that linguistically related languages share similar performance patterns and benefit from targeted post-training.

arXiv:2505.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clarifying the research framing of NLP artefacts (e.g., models, datasets, etc.) is crucial to aligning research with practical applications. Recent studies manually analyzed NLP research across domains, showing that few papers explicitly identify key stakeholders, intended uses, or appropriate contexts. In this work, we propose to automate this analysis, developing a three-component system that infers research framings by first extracting key elements (means, ends, stakeholders), then linking them through interpretable rules and contextual reasoning. We evaluate our approach on two domains: automated fact-checking using an existing dataset, and hate speech detection for which we annotate a new dataset-achieving consistent improvements over strong LLM baselines. Finally, we apply our system to recent automated fact-checking papers and uncover three notable trends: a rise in vague or underspecified research goals, increased emphasis on scientific exploration over application, and a shift toward supporting human fact-checkers rather than pursuing full automation.

arXiv:2505.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine translation (MT) systems that support low-resource languages often struggle on specialized domains. While researchers have proposed various techniques for domain adaptation, these approaches typically require model fine-tuning, making them impractical for non-technical users and small organizations. To address this gap, we propose Tulun, a versatile solution for terminology-aware translation, combining neural MT with large language model (LLM)-based post-editing guided by existing glossaries and translation memories. Our open-source web-based platform enables users to easily create, edit, and leverage terminology resources, fostering a collaborative human-machine translation process that respects and incorporates domain expertise while increasing MT accuracy. Evaluations show effectiveness in both real-world and benchmark scenarios: on medical and disaster relief translation tasks for Tetun and Bislama, our system achieves improvements of 16.90-22.41 ChrF++ points over baseline MT systems. Across six low-resource languages on the FLORES dataset, Tulun outperforms both standalone MT and LLM approaches, achieving an average improvement of 2.8 ChrF points over NLLB-54B.

Abstract: Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI, capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation, resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics, most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks (reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection) demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios, facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal levels.

<title>Large Language Models in the Task of Automatic Validation of Text Classifier Predictions</title>

Abstract: Machine learning models for text classification are trained to predict a class for a given text. To do this, training and validation samples must be prepared: a set of texts is collected, and each text is assigned a class. These classes are usually assigned by human annotators with different expertise levels, depending on the specific classification task. Collecting such samples from scratch is labor-intensive because it requires finding specialists and compensating them for their work; moreover, the number of available specialists is limited, and their productivity is constrained by human factors. While it may not be too resource-intensive to collect samples once, the ongoing need to retrain models (especially in incremental learning pipelines) to address data drift (also called model drift) makes the data collection process crucial and costly over the model's entire lifecycle. This paper proposes several approaches to replace human annotators with Large Language Models (LLMs) to test classifier predictions for correctness, helping ensure model quality and support high-quality incremental learning.

<title>Benchmarking and Rethinking Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to update the embedded knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches, whether through parameter modification or external memory integration, often suffer from inconsistent evaluation objectives and experimental setups. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study. In addition to fact-level datasets, we introduce more complex event-based datasets and general-purpose datasets drawn from other tasks. Our evaluation covers both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs, under a realistic autoregressive inference setting rather than teacher-forced decoding. Beyond single-edit assessments, we also evaluate multi-edit scenarios to better reflect practical demands. We employ four evaluation dimensions, including portability, and compare all recent methods against a simple and straightforward baseline named Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR). Empirical results reveal that parameter-based editing methods perform poorly under realistic conditions. In contrast, SCR consistently outperforms them across all settings. This study offers new insights into the limitations of current knowledge editing methods and highlights the potential of context-based reasoning as a more robust alternative.

<title>Towards Semantic Integration of Opinions: Unified Opinion Concepts Ontology and Extraction Task</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Unified Opinion Concepts (UOC) ontology to integrate opinions within their semantic context. The UOC ontology bridges the gap between the semantic representation of opinion across different formulations. It is a unified conceptualisation based on the facets of opinions studied extensively in NLP and semantic structures described through symbolic descriptions. We further propose the Unified Opinion Concept Extraction (UOCE) task of extracting opinions from the text with enhanced expressivity. Additionally, we provide a manually extended and re-annotated evaluation dataset for this task and tailored evaluation metrics to assess the adherence of extracted opinions to UOC semantics. Finally, we establish baseline performance for the UOCE task using state-of-the-art generative models.

<title>A General Knowledge Injection Framework for ICD Coding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: ICD Coding aims to assign a wide range of medical codes to a medical text document, which is a popular and challenging task in the healthcare domain. To alleviate the problems of long-tail distribution and the lack of annotations of code-specific evidence, many previous works have proposed incorporating code knowledge to improve coding performance. However, existing methods often focus on a single type of knowledge and design specialized modules that are complex and incompatible with each other, thereby limiting their scalability and effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose GKI-ICD, a novel, general knowledge injection framework that integrates three key types of knowledge, namely ICD Description, ICD Synonym, and ICD Hierarchy, without specialized design of additional modules. The comprehensive utilization of the above knowledge, which exhibits both differences and complementarity, can effectively enhance the ICD coding performance. Extensive experiments on existing popular ICD coding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GKI-ICD, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on most evaluation metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/xuzhang0112/GKI-ICD.

Abstract: Bangla or Bengali is the national language of Bangladesh, people from different regions don't talk in proper Bangla. Every division of Bangladesh has its own local language like Sylheti, Chittagong etc. In recent years some papers were published on Bangla language like sentiment analysis, fake news detection and classifications, but a few of them were on Bangla languages. This research is for the local language and this particular paper is on Sylheti language. It presented a comprehensive system using Natural Language Processing or NLP techniques for translating Pure or Modern Bangla to locally spoken Sylheti Bangla language. Total 1200 data used for training 3 models LSTM, Bi-LSTM and Seq2Seq and LSTM scored the best in performance with 89.3% accuracy. The findings of this research may contribute to the growth of Bangla NLP researchers for future more advanced innovations.

<title>Optimal Transport-Based Token Weighting scheme for Enhanced Preference Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18720</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences by directly optimizing the log-likelihood difference between chosen and rejected responses. However, existing methods assign equal importance to all tokens in the response, while humans focus on more meaningful parts. This leads to suboptimal preference optimization, as irrelevant or noisy tokens disproportionately influence DPO loss. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport-based token weighting scheme for enhancing direct \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (OTPO). By emphasizing semantically meaningful token pairs and de-emphasizing less relevant ones, our method introduces a context-aware token weighting scheme that yields a more contrastive reward difference estimate. This adaptive weighting enhances reward stability, improves interpretability, and ensures that preference optimization focuses on meaningful differences between responses. Extensive experiments have validated OTPO's effectiveness in improving instruction-following ability across various settings\footnote{Code is available at https://github.com/Mimasss2/OTPO.}.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental task in natural language processing that seeks to translate natural language questions into meaningful and executable SQL queries. While existing datasets are extensive and primarily focus on business scenarios and operational logic, they frequently lack coverage of domain-specific knowledge and complex mathematical reasoning. To address this gap, we present a novel dataset tailored for complex reasoning and chain-of-thought analysis in SQL inference, encompassing physical, arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning. The dataset consists of 4,038 English questions, each paired with a unique SQL query and accompanied by 12,114 step-by-step reasoning annotations, spanning 45 databases across diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LogicCat substantially increases the difficulty for state-of-the-art models, with the highest execution accuracy reaching only 14.96%. Incorporating our chain-of-thought annotations boosts performance to 33.96%. Benchmarking leading public methods on Spider and BIRD further underscores the unique challenges presented by LogicCat, highlighting the significant opportunities for advancing research in robust, reasoning-driven text-to-SQL systems. We have released our dataset code at https://github.com/Ffunkytao/LogicCat.

<title>Unifying Attention Heads and Task Vectors via Hidden State Geometry in In-Context Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18752</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18752</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unusual properties of in-context learning (ICL) have prompted investigations into the internal mechanisms of large language models. Prior work typically focuses on either special attention heads or task vectors at specific layers, but lacks a unified framework linking these components to the evolution of hidden states across layers that ultimately produce the model's output. In this paper, we propose such a framework for ICL in classification tasks by analyzing two geometric factors that govern performance: the separability and alignment of query hidden states. A fine-grained analysis of layer-wise dynamics reveals a striking two-stage mechanism: separability emerges in early layers, while alignment develops in later layers. Ablation studies further show that Previous Token Heads drive separability, while Induction Heads and task vectors enhance alignment. Our findings thus bridge the gap between attention heads and task vectors, offering a unified account of ICL's underlying mechanisms.

<title>Few-Shot Optimization for Sensor Data Using Large Language Models: A Case Study on Fatigue Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18754</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18754</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot optimization with HED-LM (Hybrid Euclidean Distance with Large Language Models) to improve example selection for sensor-based classification tasks. While few-shot prompting enables efficient inference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the quality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid selection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance and re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models (LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection task using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high inter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition, fatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle differences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves a mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection (59.30$\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\pm$11.39%). These represent relative improvements of 16.6% and 2.3%, respectively. The results confirm that combining numerical similarity with contextual relevance improves the robustness of few-shot prompting. Overall, HED-LM offers a practical solution to improve performance in real-world sensor-based learning tasks and shows potential for broader applications in healthcare monitoring, human activity recognition, and industrial safety scenarios.

<title>How Is LLM Reasoning Distracted by Irrelevant Context? An Analysis Using a Controlled Benchmark</title>

Abstract: We introduce Grade School Math with Distracting Context (GSM-DC), a synthetic benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning robustness against systematically controlled irrelevant context (IC). GSM-DC constructs symbolic reasoning graphs with precise distractor injections, enabling rigorous, reproducible evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs are significantly sensitive to IC, affecting both reasoning path selection and arithmetic accuracy. Additionally, training models with strong distractors improves performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We further propose a stepwise tree search guided by a process reward model, which notably enhances robustness in out-of-distribution conditions.

<title>Towards an automatic method for generating topical vocabulary test forms for specific reading passages</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background knowledge is typically needed for successful comprehension of topical and domain specific reading passages, such as in the STEM domain. However, there are few automated measures of student knowledge that can be readily deployed and scored in time to make predictions on whether a given student will likely be able to understand a specific content area text. In this paper, we present our effort in developing K-tool, an automated system for generating topical vocabulary tests that measure students' background knowledge related to a specific text. The system automatically detects the topic of a given text and produces topical vocabulary items based on their relationship with the topic. This information is used to automatically generate background knowledge forms that contain words that are highly related to the topic and words that share similar features but do not share high associations to the topic. Prior research indicates that performance on such tasks can help determine whether a student is likely to understand a particular text based on their knowledge state. The described system is intended for use with middle and high school student population of native speakers of English. It is designed to handle single reading passages and is not dependent on any corpus or text collection. In this paper, we describe the system architecture and present an initial evaluation of the system outputs.

<title>Disentangling Knowledge Representations for Large Language Model Editing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Editing has emerged as a promising solution for efficiently updating embedded knowledge in large language models (LLMs). While existing approaches demonstrate effectiveness in integrating new knowledge and preserving the original capabilities of LLMs, they fail to maintain fine-grained irrelevant knowledge facts that share the same subject as edited knowledge but differ in relation and object. This challenge arises because subject representations inherently encode multiple attributes, causing the target and fine-grained irrelevant knowledge to become entangled in the representation space, and thus vulnerable to unintended alterations during editing. To address this, we propose DiKE, a novel approach that Disentangles Knowledge representations for LLM Editing (DiKE). DiKE consists of two key components: a Knowledge Representation Disentanglement (KRD) module that decomposes the subject representation into target-knowledgerelated and -unrelated components, and a Disentanglement-based Knowledge Edit (DKE) module that updates only the target-related component while explicitly preserving the unrelated one. We further derive a closed-form, rank-one parameter update based on matrix theory to enable efficient and minimally invasive edits. To rigorously evaluate fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation, we construct FINE-KED, a new benchmark comprising fine-grained irrelevant knowledge at different levels of relational similarity to the edited knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that DiKE substantially improves fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation while maintaining competitive general editing performance.

<title>ALPS: Attention Localization and Pruning Strategy for Efficient Alignment of Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks often incurs significant costs, including constructing task-specific instruction pairs and extensive training adjustments. Prior research has explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model alignment efficiency, we propose the \textit{\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{L}ocalization and \textbf{P}runing \textbf{S}trategy (\textbf{ALPS})}, an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method activates only \textbf{10\%} of attention parameters during fine-tuning while achieving a \textbf{2\%} performance improvement over baselines on three tasks. Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets and mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel perspective on efficient LLM alignment.

<title>Don't Look Only Once: Towards Multimodal Interactive Reasoning with Selective Visual Revisitation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present v1, a lightweight extension to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that enables selective visual revisitation during inference. While current MLLMs typically consume visual input only once and reason purely over internal memory, v1 introduces a simple point-and-copy mechanism that allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant image regions throughout the reasoning process. This mechanism augments existing architectures with minimal modifications, enabling contextual access to visual tokens based on the model's evolving hypotheses. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Experiments on three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks -- MathVista, MathVision, and MathVerse -- demonstrate that v1 consistently improves performance over comparable baselines, particularly on tasks requiring fine-grained visual reference and multi-step reasoning. Our results suggest that dynamic visual access is a promising direction for enhancing grounded multimodal reasoning. Code, models, and data will be released to support future research.

Abstract: Multi-party Conversational Agents (MPCAs) are systems designed to engage in dialogue with more than two participants simultaneously. Unlike traditional two-party agents, designing MPCAs faces additional challenges due to the need to interpret both utterance semantics and social dynamics. This survey explores recent progress in MPCAs by addressing three key questions: 1) Can agents model each participants' mental states? (State of Mind Modeling); 2) Can they properly understand the dialogue content? (Semantic Understanding); and 3) Can they reason about and predict future conversation flow? (Agent Action Modeling). We review methods ranging from classical machine learning to Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal systems. Our analysis underscores Theory of Mind (ToM) as essential for building intelligent MPCAs and highlights multi-modal understanding as a promising yet underexplored direction. Finally, this survey offers guidance to future researchers on developing more capable MPCAs.

<title>Smoothie: Smoothing Diffusion on Token Embeddings for Text Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18853</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generating images, audio, and video, but their adaptation to text remains challenging due to its discrete nature. Prior approaches either apply Gaussian diffusion in continuous latent spaces, which inherits semantic structure but struggles with token decoding, or operate in categorical simplex space, which respect discreteness but disregard semantic relation between tokens. In this paper, we propose Smoothing Diffusion on Token Embeddings (Smoothie), a novel diffusion method that combines the strengths of both approaches by progressively smoothing token embeddings based on semantic similarity. This technique enables gradual information removal while maintaining a natural decoding process. Experimental results on several sequence-to-sequence generation tasks demonstrate that Smoothie outperforms existing diffusion-based models in generation quality. Furthermore, ablation studies show that our proposed diffusion space yields better performance than both the standard embedding space and the categorical simplex. Our code is available at https://github.com/ashaba1in/smoothie.

arXiv:2505.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Exemplar-Based Expository Text Generation task, aiming to generate an expository text on a new topic using an exemplar on a similar topic. Current methods fall short due to their reliance on extensive exemplar data, difficulty in adapting topic-specific content, and issues with long-text coherence. To address these challenges, we propose the concept of Adaptive Imitation and present a novel Recurrent Plan-then-Adapt (RePA) framework. RePA leverages large language models (LLMs) for effective adaptive imitation through a fine-grained plan-then-adapt process. RePA also enables recurrent segment-by-segment imitation, supported by two memory structures that enhance input clarity and output coherence. We also develop task-specific evaluation metrics--imitativeness, adaptiveness, and adaptive-imitativeness--using LLMs as evaluators. Experimental results across our collected three diverse datasets demonstrate that RePA surpasses existing baselines in producing factual, consistent, and relevant texts for this task.

<title>Audio Jailbreak Attacks: Exposing Vulnerabilities in SpeechGPT in a White-Box Framework</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced the naturalness and flexibility of human computer interaction by enabling seamless understanding across text, vision, and audio modalities. Among these, voice enabled models such as SpeechGPT have demonstrated considerable improvements in usability, offering expressive, and emotionally responsive interactions that foster deeper connections in real world communication scenarios. However, the use of voice introduces new security risks, as attackers can exploit the unique characteristics of spoken language, such as timing, pronunciation variability, and speech to text translation, to craft inputs that bypass defenses in ways not seen in text-based systems. Despite substantial research on text based jailbreaks, the voice modality remains largely underexplored in terms of both attack strategies and defense mechanisms. In this work, we present an adversarial attack targeting the speech input of aligned MLLMs in a white box scenario. Specifically, we introduce a novel token level attack that leverages access to the model's speech tokenization to generate adversarial token sequences. These sequences are then synthesized into audio prompts, which effectively bypass alignment safeguards and to induce prohibited outputs. Evaluated on SpeechGPT, our approach achieves up to 89 percent attack success rate across multiple restricted tasks, significantly outperforming existing voice based jailbreak methods. Our findings shed light on the vulnerabilities of voice-enabled multimodal systems and to help guide the development of more robust next-generation MLLMs.

arXiv:2505.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lay paraphrasing aims to make scientific information accessible to audiences without technical backgrounds. However, most existing studies focus on a single domain, such as biomedicine. With the rise of interdisciplinary research, it is increasingly necessary to comprehend knowledge spanning multiple technical fields. To address this, we propose Sci-LoRA, a model that leverages a mixture of LoRAs fine-tuned on multiple scientific domains. In particular, Sci-LoRA dynamically generates and applies weights for each LoRA, enabling it to adjust the impact of different domains based on the input text, without requiring explicit domain labels. To balance domain-specific knowledge and generalization across various domains, Sci-LoRA integrates information at both the data and model levels. This dynamic fusion enhances the adaptability and performance across various domains. Experimental results across twelve domains on five public datasets show that Sci-LoRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art large language models and demonstrates flexible generalization and adaptability in cross-domain lay paraphrasing.

Abstract: While AI agents hold transformative potential in business, effective performance benchmarking is hindered by the scarcity of public, realistic business data on widely used platforms. Existing benchmarks often lack fidelity in their environments, data, and agent-user interactions, with limited coverage of diverse business scenarios and industries. To address these gaps, we introduce CRMArena-Pro, a novel benchmark for holistic, realistic assessment of LLM agents in diverse professional settings. CRMArena-Pro expands on CRMArena with nineteen expert-validated tasks across sales, service, and 'configure, price, and quote' processes, for both Business-to-Business and Business-to-Customer scenarios. It distinctively incorporates multi-turn interactions guided by diverse personas and robust confidentiality awareness assessments. Experiments reveal leading LLM agents achieve only around 58% single-turn success on CRMArena-Pro, with performance dropping significantly to approximately 35% in multi-turn settings. While Workflow Execution proves more tractable for top agents (over 83% single-turn success), other evaluated business skills present greater challenges. Furthermore, agents exhibit near-zero inherent confidentiality awareness; though targeted prompting can improve this, it often compromises task performance. These findings highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and enterprise demands, underscoring the need for advancements in multi-turn reasoning, confidentiality adherence, and versatile skill acquisition.

Abstract: Aiming towards improving current computational models of humor detection, we propose a new multimodal dataset of stand-up comedies, in seven languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Hungarian and Czech. Our dataset of more than 330 hours, is at the time of writing the biggest available for this type of task, and the most diverse. The whole dataset is automatically annotated in laughter (from the audience), and the subpart left for model validation is manually annotated. Contrary to contemporary approaches, we do not frame the task of humor detection as a binary sequence classification, but as word-level sequence labeling, in order to take into account all the context of the sequence and to capture the continuous joke tagging mechanism typically occurring in natural conversations. As par with unimodal baselines results, we propose a method for e propose a method to enhance the automatic laughter detection based on Audio Speech Recognition errors.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the first publicly available English-Kpelle dataset for machine translation, comprising over 2000 sentence pairs drawn from everyday communication, religious texts, and educational materials. By fine-tuning Meta's No Language Left Behind(NLLB) model on two versions of the dataset, we achieved BLEU scores of up to 30 in the Kpelle-to-English direction, demonstrating the benefits of data augmentation. Our findings align with NLLB-200 benchmarks on other African languages, underscoring Kpelle's potential for competitive performance despite its low-resource status. Beyond machine translation, this dataset enables broader NLP tasks, including speech recognition and language modelling. We conclude with a roadmap for future dataset expansion, emphasizing orthographic consistency, community-driven validation, and interdisciplinary collaboration to advance inclusive language technology development for Kpelle and other low-resourced Mande languages.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Federated RAG) combines Federated Learning (FL), which enables distributed model training without exposing raw data, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which improves the factual accuracy of language models by grounding outputs in external knowledge. As large language models are increasingly deployed in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and personalized assistance, Federated RAG offers a promising framework for secure, knowledge-intensive natural language processing (NLP). To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first systematic mapping study of Federated RAG, covering literature published between 2020 and 2025. Following Kitchenham's guidelines for evidence-based software engineering, we develop a structured classification of research focuses, contribution types, and application domains. We analyze architectural patterns, temporal trends, and key challenges, including privacy-preserving retrieval, cross-client heterogeneity, and evaluation limitations. Our findings synthesize a rapidly evolving body of research, identify recurring design patterns, and surface open questions, providing a foundation for future work at the intersection of RAG and federated systems.

Abstract: We introduce SCRum-9, a multilingual dataset for Rumour Stance Classification, containing 7,516 tweet-reply pairs from X. SCRum-9 goes beyond existing stance classification datasets by covering more languages (9), linking examples to more fact-checked claims (2.1k), and including complex annotations from multiple annotators to account for intra- and inter-annotator variability. Annotations were made by at least three native speakers per language, totalling around 405 hours of annotation and 8,150 dollars in compensation. Experiments on SCRum-9 show that it is a challenging benchmark for both state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g. Deepseek) as well as fine-tuned pre-trained models, motivating future work in this area.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As online platforms grow, comment sections increasingly host harassment that undermines user experience and well-being. This study benchmarks three leading large language models, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic Claude 3 Opus, on a corpus of 5,080 YouTube comments sampled from high-abuse threads in gaming, lifestyle, food vlog, and music channels. The dataset comprises 1,334 harmful and 3,746 non-harmful messages in English, Arabic, and Indonesian, annotated independently by two reviewers with substantial agreement (Cohen's kappa = 0.83). Using a unified prompt and deterministic settings, GPT-4.1 achieved the best overall balance with an F1 score of 0.863, precision of 0.887, and recall of 0.841. Gemini flagged the highest share of harmful posts (recall = 0.875) but its precision fell to 0.767 due to frequent false positives. Claude delivered the highest precision at 0.920 and the lowest false-positive rate of 0.022, yet its recall dropped to 0.720. Qualitative analysis showed that all three models struggle with sarcasm, coded insults, and mixed-language slang. These results underscore the need for moderation pipelines that combine complementary models, incorporate conversational context, and fine-tune for under-represented languages and implicit abuse. A de-identified version of the dataset and full prompts is publicly released to promote reproducibility and further progress in automated content moderation.

<title>MetaMind: Modeling Human Social Thoughts with Metacognitive Multi-Agent Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18943</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models (LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses user mental states (e.g., intent, emotion), (2) a Domain Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in empathetic dialogue and culturally sensitive interactions.

<title>The Price of Format: Diversity Collapse in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18949</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18949</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) employ structured templates, such as role markers and special tokens, to enforce format consistency during inference. However, we identify a critical limitation of such formatting: it induces a phenomenon we term diversity collapse, where the model generates semantically similar outputs for open-ended inputs, undermining creativity and variability. We systematically evaluate this effect across tasks like story completion and free-form generation, finding that (1) diversity collapse persists even under high-temperature sampling, and (2) structural tokens in templates significantly constrain the model's output space. To contextualize these findings, we fine-tune the same model using a range of structured prompts and then evaluate them across three axes: downstream task performance, alignment behavior, and output diversity. Our analysis shows that format consistency between fine-tuning and inference is crucial for structure-sensitive tasks (e.g., GSM8K, IFEval), but has marginal influence on knowledge-heavy tasks (e.g., MMLU, WebQuestions). In contrast, output diversity is primarily governed by the presence or absence of structural tokens, with minimal formatting yielding the most diverse outputs. These findings reveal that current prompting conventions, while beneficial for alignment, may inadvertently suppress output diversity, underscoring the need for diversity-aware prompt design and instruction tuning.

Abstract: The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark has been widely used to evaluate language models across various domains. However, existing MMLU datasets primarily focus on high-resource languages such as English, which leaves low-resource languages like Bengali underrepresented. In this paper, we introduce BnMMLU, a benchmark to evaluate the multitask language understanding capabilities of Bengali in language models. The dataset spans 23 domains, including science, humanities, mathematics and general knowledge and is structured in a multiple-choice format to assess factual knowledge, application-based problem-solving and reasoning abilities of language models. It consists of 138,949 question-option pairs. We benchmark several proprietary and open-source large language models (LLMs) on the BnMMLU test set. Additionally, we annotate the test set with three cognitive categories-factual knowledge, procedural application and reasoning-to gain deeper insights into model strengths and weaknesses across various cognitive tasks. The results reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting the need for improved pre-training and fine-tuning strategies tailored to Bengali data. We release the dataset and benchmark results to facilitate further research in this area.

Abstract: We evaluate the credibility of leading AI models in assessing investment risk appetite. Our analysis spans proprietary (GPT-4, Claude 3.7, Gemini 1.5) and open-weight models (LLaMA 3.1/3.3, DeepSeek-V3, Mistral-small), using 1,720 user profiles constructed with 16 risk-relevant features across 10 countries and both genders. We observe significant variance across models in score distributions and demographic sensitivity. For example, GPT-4o assigns higher risk scores to Nigerian and Indonesian profiles, while LLaMA and DeepSeek show opposite gender tendencies in risk classification. While some models (e.g., GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1) align closely with expected scores in low- and mid-risk ranges, none maintain consistent performance across regions and demographics. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous, standardized evaluations of AI systems in regulated financial contexts to prevent bias, opacity, and inconsistency in real-world deployment.

<title>System-1.5 Reasoning: Traversal in Language and Latent Spaces with Dynamic Shortcuts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18962</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18962</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to move beyond fast System-1 responses and engage in deliberative System-2 reasoning. However, this comes at the cost of significant inefficiency due to verbose intermediate output. Recent latent-space reasoning methods improve efficiency by operating on hidden states without decoding into language, yet they treat all steps uniformly, failing to distinguish critical deductions from auxiliary steps and resulting in suboptimal use of computational resources. In this paper, we propose System-1.5 Reasoning, an adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically allocates computation across reasoning steps through shortcut paths in latent space.Specifically, System-1.5 Reasoning introduces two types of dynamic shortcuts. The model depth shortcut (DS) adaptively reasons along the vertical depth by early exiting non-critical tokens through lightweight adapter branches, while allowing critical tokens to continue through deeper Transformer layers. The step shortcut (SS) reuses hidden states across the decoding steps to skip trivial steps and reason horizontally in latent space. Training System-1.5 Reasoning involves a two-stage self-distillation process: first distilling natural language CoT into latent-space continuous thought, and then distilling full-path System-2 latent reasoning into adaptive shortcut paths (System-1.5 Reasoning).Experiments on reasoning tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method. For example, on GSM8K, System-1.5 Reasoning achieves reasoning performance comparable to traditional CoT fine-tuning methods while accelerating inference by over 20x and reducing token generation by 92.31% on average.

<title>Learning to Explain: Prototype-Based Surrogate Models for LLM Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on natural language tasks, but their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. Existing explanation methods either suffer from limited faithfulness to the model's reasoning or produce explanations that humans find difficult to understand. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ProtoSurE}, a novel prototype-based surrogate framework that provides faithful and human-understandable explanations for LLMs. ProtoSurE trains an interpretable-by-design surrogate model that aligns with the target LLM while utilizing sentence-level prototypes as human-understandable concepts. Extensive experiments show that ProtoSurE consistently outperforms SOTA explanation methods across diverse LLMs and datasets. Importantly, ProtoSurE demonstrates strong data efficiency, requiring relatively few training examples to achieve good performance, making it practical for real-world applications.

<title>Is Architectural Complexity Overrated? Competitive and Interpretable Knowledge Graph Completion with RelatE</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the efficacy of simple, real-valued embedding models for knowledge graph completion and introduce RelatE, an interpretable and modular method that efficiently integrates dual representations for entities and relations. RelatE employs a real-valued phase-modulus decomposition, leveraging sinusoidal phase alignments to encode relational patterns such as symmetry, inversion, and composition. In contrast to recent approaches based on complex-valued embeddings or deep neural architectures, RelatE preserves architectural simplicity while achieving competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks. Empirically, RelatE outperforms prior methods across several datasets: on YAGO3-10, it achieves an MRR of 0.521 and Hit@10 of 0.680, surpassing all baselines. Additionally, RelatE offers significant efficiency gains, reducing training time by 24%, inference latency by 31%, and peak GPU memory usage by 22% compared to RotatE. Perturbation studies demonstrate improved robustness, with MRR degradation reduced by up to 61% relative to TransE and by up to 19% compared to RotatE under structural edits such as edge removals and relation swaps. Formal analysis further establishes the model's full expressiveness and its capacity to represent essential first-order logical inference patterns. These results position RelatE as a scalable and interpretable alternative to more complex architectures for knowledge graph completion.

<title>Hierarchical Mamba Meets Hyperbolic Geometry: A New Paradigm for Structured Language Embeddings</title>

arXiv:2505.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective state-space models have achieved great success in long-sequence modeling. However, their capacity for language representation, especially in complex hierarchical reasoning tasks, remains underexplored. Most large language models rely on flat Euclidean embeddings, limiting their ability to capture latent hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Mamba (HiM), integrating efficient Mamba2 with exponential growth and curved nature of hyperbolic geometry to learn hierarchy-aware language embeddings for deeper linguistic understanding. Mamba2-processed sequences are projected to the Poincare ball (via tangent-based mapping) or Lorentzian manifold (via cosine and sine-based mapping) with "learnable" curvature, optimized with a combined hyperbolic loss. Our HiM model facilitates the capture of relational distances across varying hierarchical levels, enabling effective long-range reasoning. This makes it well-suited for tasks like mixed-hop prediction and multi-hop inference in hierarchical classification. We evaluated our HiM with four linguistic and medical datasets for mixed-hop prediction and multi-hop inference tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that: 1) Both HiM models effectively capture hierarchical relationships for four ontological datasets, surpassing Euclidean baselines. 2) HiM-Poincare captures fine-grained semantic distinctions with higher h-norms, while HiM-Lorentz provides more stable, compact, and hierarchy-preserving embeddings favoring robustness over detail.

Abstract: Existing mathematical reasoning benchmarks are predominantly English only or translation-based, which can introduce semantic drift and mask languagespecific reasoning errors. To address this, we present AI4Math, a benchmark of 105 original university level math problems natively authored in Spanish. The dataset spans seven advanced domains (Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Probability, Number Theory, Combinatorics, and Logic), and each problem is accompanied by a step by step human solution. We evaluate six large language models GPT 4o, GPT 4o mini, o3 mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, DeepSeek R1 685B, and DeepSeek V3 685B under four configurations: zero shot and chain of thought, each in Spanish and English. The top models (o3 mini, DeepSeek R1 685B, DeepSeek V3 685B) achieve over 70% accuracy, whereas LLaMA 3.3 70B and GPT-4o mini remain below 40%. Most models show no significant performance drop between languages, with GPT 4o even performing better on Spanish problems in the zero shot setting. Geometry, Combinatorics, and Probability questions remain persistently challenging for all models. These results highlight the need for native-language benchmarks and domain-specific evaluations to reveal reasoning failures not captured by standard metrics.

<title>VerIPO: Cultivating Long Reasoning in Video-LLMs via Verifier-Gudied Iterative Policy Optimization</title>

arXiv:2505.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) shows significant promise for complex video reasoning. However, popular Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) methods, such as outcome-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are limited by data preparation bottlenecks (e.g., noise or high cost) and exhibit unstable improvements in the quality of long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) and downstream performance.To address these limitations, we propose VerIPO, a Verifier-guided Iterative Policy Optimization method designed to gradually improve video LLMs' capacity for generating deep, long-term reasoning chains. The core component is Rollout-Aware Verifier, positioned between the GRPO and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training phases to form the GRPO-Verifier-DPO training loop. This verifier leverages small LLMs as a judge to assess the reasoning logic of rollouts, enabling the construction of high-quality contrastive data, including reflective and contextually consistent CoTs. These curated preference samples drive the efficient DPO stage (7x faster than GRPO), leading to marked improvements in reasoning chain quality, especially in terms of length and contextual consistency. This training loop benefits from GRPO's expansive search and DPO's targeted optimization. Experimental results demonstrate: 1) Significantly faster and more effective optimization compared to standard GRPO variants, yielding superior performance; 2) Our trained models exceed the direct inference of large-scale instruction-tuned Video-LLMs, producing long and contextually consistent CoTs on diverse video reasoning tasks; and 3) Our model with one iteration outperforms powerful LMMs (e.g., Kimi-VL) and long reasoning models (e.g., Video-R1), highlighting its effectiveness and stability.

<title>CrosGrpsABS: Cross-Attention over Syntactic and Semantic Graphs for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis in a Low-Resource Language</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fundamental task in natural language processing, offering fine-grained insights into opinions expressed in text. While existing research has largely focused on resource-rich languages like English which leveraging large annotated datasets, pre-trained models, and language-specific tools. These resources are often unavailable for low-resource languages such as Bengali. The ABSA task in Bengali remains poorly explored and is further complicated by its unique linguistic characteristics and a lack of annotated data, pre-trained models, and optimized hyperparameters. To address these challenges, this research propose CrosGrpsABS, a novel hybrid framework that leverages bidirectional cross-attention between syntactic and semantic graphs to enhance aspect-level sentiment classification. The CrosGrpsABS combines transformerbased contextual embeddings with graph convolutional networks, built upon rule-based syntactic dependency parsing and semantic similarity computations. By employing bidirectional crossattention, the model effectively fuses local syntactic structure with global semantic context, resulting in improved sentiment classification performance across both low- and high-resource settings. We evaluate CrosGrpsABS on four low-resource Bengali ABSA datasets and the high-resource English SemEval 2014 Task 4 dataset. The CrosGrpsABS consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving notable improvements, including a 0.93% F1-score increase for the Restaurant domain and a 1.06% gain for the Laptop domain in the SemEval 2014 Task 4 benchmark.

Abstract: Effective data selection is critical for efficient training of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Influence Distillation, a novel, mathematically-justified framework for data selection that employs second-order information to optimally weight training samples. By distilling each sample's influence on a target distribution, our method assigns model-specific weights that are used to select training data for LLM fine-tuning, guiding it toward strong performance on the target domain. We derive these optimal weights for both Gradient Descent and Adam optimizers. To ensure scalability and reduce computational cost, we propose a $\textit{landmark-based approximation}$: influence is precisely computed for a small subset of "landmark" samples and then efficiently propagated to all other samples to determine their weights. We validate Influence Distillation by applying it to instruction tuning on the Tulu V2 dataset, targeting a range of tasks including GSM8k, SQuAD, and MMLU, across several models from the Llama and Qwen families. Experiments show that Influence Distillation matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance while achieving up to $3.5\times$ faster selection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to comply with safety guidelines by refusing harmful instructions. A recent attack, termed abliteration, isolates and suppresses the single latent direction most responsible for refusal behavior, enabling the model to generate unethical content. We propose a defense that modifies how models generate refusals. We construct an extended-refusal dataset that contains harmful prompts with a full response that justifies the reason for refusal. We then fine-tune Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen2.5-Instruct (1.5B and 3B parameters) on our extended-refusal dataset, and evaluate the resulting systems on a set of harmful prompts. In our experiments, extended-refusal models maintain high refusal rates, dropping at most by 10%, whereas baseline models' refusal rates drop by 70-80% after abliteration. A broad evaluation of safety and utility shows that extended-refusal fine-tuning neutralizes the abliteration attack while preserving general performance.

<title>UNCERTAINTY-LINE: Length-Invariant Estimation of Uncertainty for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools across various applications, making it more important than ever to ensure the quality and the trustworthiness of their outputs. This has led to growing interest in uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for assessing the reliability of LLM outputs. Many existing UQ techniques rely on token probabilities, which inadvertently introduces a bias with respect to the length of the output. While some methods attempt to account for this, we demonstrate that such biases persist even in length-normalized approaches. To address the problem, here we propose UNCERTAINTY-LINE: (Length-INvariant Estimation), a simple debiasing procedure that regresses uncertainty scores on output length and uses the residuals as corrected, length-invariant estimates. Our method is post-hoc, model-agnostic, and applicable to a range of UQ measures. Through extensive evaluation on machine translation, summarization, and question-answering tasks, we demonstrate that UNCERTAINTY-LINE: consistently improves over even nominally length-normalized UQ methods uncertainty estimates across multiple metrics and models.

<title>Towards Harmonized Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: To facilitate robust and trustworthy deployment of large language models (LLMs), it is essential to quantify the reliability of their generations through uncertainty estimation. While recent efforts have made significant advancements by leveraging the internal logic and linguistic features of LLMs to estimate uncertainty scores, our empirical analysis highlights the pitfalls of these methods to strike a harmonized estimation between indication, balance, and calibration, which hinders their broader capability for accurate uncertainty estimation. To address this challenge, we propose CUE (Corrector for Uncertainty Estimation): A straightforward yet effective method that employs a lightweight model trained on data aligned with the target LLM's performance to adjust uncertainty scores. Comprehensive experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, which achieves consistent improvements of up to 60% over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have greatly enhanced their capability to jointly process text and images. However, despite extensive benchmarks evaluating visual comprehension (e.g., diagrams, color schemes, OCR tasks...), there is limited assessment of VLMs' ability to read and reason about text-rich images effectively. To fill this gap, we introduce ReadBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reading comprehension capabilities of VLMs. ReadBench transposes contexts from established text-only benchmarks into images of text while keeping textual prompts and questions intact. Evaluating leading VLMs with ReadBench, we find minimal-but-present performance degradation on short, text-image inputs, while performance sharply declines for longer, multi-page contexts. Our experiments further reveal that text resolution has negligible effects on multimodal performance. These findings highlight needed improvements in VLMs, particularly their reasoning over visually presented extensive textual content, a capability critical for practical applications. ReadBench is available at https://github.com/answerdotai/ReadBench .

<title>ASPO: Adaptive Sentence-Level Preference Optimization for Fine-Grained Multimodal Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19100</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained significant attention for its simplicity and computational efficiency in aligning large language models (LLMs). Recent advancements have extended DPO to multimodal scenarios, achieving strong performance. However, traditional DPO relies on binary preference optimization, rewarding or penalizing entire responses without considering fine-grained segment correctness, leading to suboptimal solutions. The root of this issue lies in the absence of fine-grained supervision during the optimization process. To address this, we propose Adaptive Sentence-level Preference Optimization (ASPO), which evaluates individual sentences for more precise preference optimization. By dynamically calculating adaptive rewards at the sentence level based on model predictions, ASPO enhances response content assessment without additional models or parameters. This significantly improves the alignment of multimodal features. Extensive experiments show that ASPO substantially enhances the overall performance of multimodal models.

Abstract: Spoken language conveys meaning not only through words but also through intonation, emotion, and emphasis. Sentence stress, the emphasis placed on specific words within a sentence, is crucial for conveying speaker intent and has been extensively studied in linguistics. In this work, we introduce WHISTRESS, an alignment-free approach for enhancing transcription systems with sentence stress detection. To support this task, we propose TINYSTRESS-15K, a scalable, synthetic training data for the task of sentence stress detection which resulted from a fully automated dataset creation process. We train WHISTRESS on TINYSTRESS-15K and evaluate it against several competitive baselines. Our results show that WHISTRESS outperforms existing methods while requiring no additional input priors during training or inference. Notably, despite being trained on synthetic data, WHISTRESS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across diverse benchmarks. Project page: https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/whistress.

Abstract: Investigating hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs) within cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios can greatly advance the large-scale deployment in real-world applications. Nevertheless, the current studies are limited to a single scenario, either cross-lingual or cross-modal, leaving a gap in the exploration of hallucinations in the joint cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel joint Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Hallucinations benchmark (CCHall) to fill this gap. Specifically, CCHall simultaneously incorporates both cross-lingual and cross-modal hallucination scenarios, which can be used to assess the cross-lingual and cross-modal capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on CCHall, exploring both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. The experimental results highlight that current LLMs still struggle with CCHall. We hope CCHall can serve as a valuable resource to assess LLMs in joint cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios.

<title>Self-Critique Guided Iterative Reasoning for Multi-hop Question Answering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they still face challenges in knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning. Recent work explores iterative retrieval to address complex problems. However, the lack of intermediate guidance often results in inaccurate retrieval and flawed intermediate reasoning, leading to incorrect reasoning. To address these, we propose Self-Critique Guided Iterative Reasoning (SiGIR), which uses self-critique feedback to guide the iterative reasoning process. Specifically, through end-to-end training, we enable the model to iteratively address complex problems via question decomposition. Additionally, the model is able to self-evaluate its intermediate reasoning steps. During iterative reasoning, the model engages in branching exploration and employs self-evaluation to guide the selection of promising reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the previous SOTA by $8.6\%$. Furthermore, our thorough analysis offers insights for future research. Our code, data, and models are available at Github: https://github.com/zchuz/SiGIR-MHQA.

<title>Controlling Language Confusion in Multilingual LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19116</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models often suffer from language confusion, a phenomenon where responses are partially or entirely generated in unintended languages. This can critically impact user experience in low-resource settings. We hypothesize that conventional supervised fine-tuning exacerbates this issue because the softmax objective focuses probability mass only on the single correct token but does not explicitly penalize cross-lingual mixing. Interestingly, by observing loss trajectories during the pretraining phase, we observe that models fail to learn to distinguish between monolingual and language-confused text. Additionally, we find that ORPO, which adds penalties for unwanted output styles to standard SFT, effectively suppresses language-confused generations even at high decoding temperatures without degrading overall model performance. Our findings suggest that incorporating appropriate penalty terms can mitigate language confusion in low-resource settings with limited data.

arXiv:2505.19121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the recent strides in large language models, studies have underscored the existence of social biases within these systems. In this paper, we delve into the validation and comparison of the ethical biases of LLMs concerning globally discussed and potentially sensitive topics, hypothesizing that these biases may arise from language-specific distinctions. Introducing the Multilingual Sensitive Questions & Answers Dataset (MSQAD), we collected news articles from Human Rights Watch covering 17 topics, and generated socially sensitive questions along with corresponding responses in multiple languages. We scrutinized the biases of these responses across languages and topics, employing two statistical hypothesis tests. The results showed that the null hypotheses were rejected in most cases, indicating biases arising from cross-language differences. It demonstrates that ethical biases in responses are widespread across various languages, and notably, these biases were prevalent even among different LLMs. By making the proposed MSQAD openly available, we aim to facilitate future research endeavors focused on examining cross-language biases in LLMs and their variant models.

Abstract: The advent of large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, has significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks. However, their capabilities in multilingual complex reasoning remain underexplored, with existing efforts largely focused on simpler tasks like MGSM. To address this gap, we introduce MMATH, a benchmark for multilingual complex reasoning spanning 374 high-quality math problems across 10 typologically diverse languages. Using MMATH, we observe that even advanced models like DeepSeek R1 exhibit substantial performance disparities across languages and suffer from a critical off-target issue-generating responses in unintended languages. To address this, we explore strategies including prompting and training, demonstrating that reasoning in English and answering in target languages can simultaneously enhance performance and preserve target-language consistency. Our findings offer new insights and practical strategies for advancing the multilingual reasoning capabilities of large language models. Our code and data could be found at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/MMATH.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of large language models has led to significant performance breakthroughs in named entity recognition (NER) for high-resource languages, yet there remains substantial room for improvement in low- and medium-resource languages. Existing multilingual NER methods face severe language interference during the multi-language adaptation process, manifested in feature conflicts between different languages and the competitive suppression of low-resource language features by high-resource languages. Although training a dedicated model for each language can mitigate such interference, it lacks scalability and incurs excessive computational costs in real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose RetrieveAll, a universal multilingual NER framework based on dynamic LoRA. The framework decouples task-specific features across languages and demonstrates efficient dynamic adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-granularity knowledge augmented method that fully exploits the intrinsic potential of the data without relying on external resources. By leveraging a hierarchical prompting mechanism to guide knowledge injection, this approach advances the paradigm from "prompt-guided inference" to "prompt-driven learning." Experimental results show that RetrieveAll outperforms existing baselines; on the PAN-X dataset, it achieves an average F1 improvement of 12.1 percent.

<title>Shifting AI Efficiency From Model-Centric to Data-Centric Compression</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position token compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current challenges in token compression research and outline promising future directions. Ultimately, our work aims to offer a fresh perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing research, and catalyze innovative developments to address the challenges that increasing context lengths pose to the AI community's advancement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various disciplines and tasks. However, benchmarking their capabilities with multilingual spoken queries remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce SpokenNativQA, the first multilingual and culturally aligned spoken question-answering (SQA) dataset designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world conversational settings. The dataset comprises approximately 33,000 naturally spoken questions and answers in multiple languages, including low-resource and dialect-rich languages, providing a robust benchmark for assessing LLM performance in speech-based interactions. SpokenNativQA addresses the limitations of text-based QA datasets by incorporating speech variability, accents, and linguistic diversity. We benchmark different ASR systems and LLMs for SQA and present our findings. We released the data at (https://huggingface.co/datasets/QCRI/SpokenNativQA) and the experimental scripts at (https://llmebench.qcri.org/) for the research community.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However, training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Liuz233/AGDe-Judge.

Abstract: Can LLMs accurately adjust their confidence when facing opposition? Building on previous studies measuring calibration on static fact-based question-answering tasks, we evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in a dynamic, adversarial debate setting, uniquely combining two realistic factors: (a) a multi-turn format requiring models to update beliefs as new information emerges, and (b) a zero-sum structure to control for task-related uncertainty, since mutual high-confidence claims imply systematic overconfidence. We organized 60 three-round policy debates among ten state-of-the-art LLMs, with models privately rating their confidence (0-100) in winning after each round. We observed five concerning patterns: (1) Systematic overconfidence: models began debates with average initial confidence of 72.9% vs. a rational 50% baseline. (2) Confidence escalation: rather than reducing confidence as debates progressed, debaters increased their win probabilities, averaging 83% by the final round. (3) Mutual overestimation: in 61.7% of debates, both sides simultaneously claimed >=75% probability of victory, a logical impossibility. (4) Persistent self-debate bias: models debating identical copies increased confidence from 64.1% to 75.2%; even when explicitly informed their chance of winning was exactly 50%, confidence still rose (from 50.0% to 57.1%). (5) Misaligned private reasoning: models' private scratchpad thoughts sometimes differed from their public confidence ratings, raising concerns about faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning. These results suggest LLMs lack the ability to accurately self-assess or update their beliefs in dynamic, multi-turn tasks; a major concern as LLM outputs are deployed without careful review in assistant roles or agentic settings.

arXiv:2505.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR (Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity. Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to -41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond). Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes, data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.

Abstract: Inconsistent political statements represent a form of misinformation. They erode public trust and pose challenges to accountability, when left unnoticed. Detecting inconsistencies automatically could support journalists in asking clarification questions, thereby helping to keep politicians accountable. We propose the Inconsistency detection task and develop a scale of inconsistency types to prompt NLP-research in this direction. To provide a resource for detecting inconsistencies in a political domain, we present a dataset of 698 human-annotated pairs of political statements with explanations of the annotators' reasoning for 237 samples. The statements mainly come from voting assistant platforms such as Wahl-O-Mat in Germany and Smartvote in Switzerland, reflecting real-world political issues. We benchmark Large Language Models (LLMs) on our dataset and show that in general, they are as good as humans at detecting inconsistencies, and might be even better than individual humans at predicting the crowd-annotated ground-truth. However, when it comes to identifying fine-grained inconsistency types, none of the model have reached the upper bound of performance (due to natural labeling variation), thus leaving room for improvement. We make our dataset and code publicly available.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a powerful method for accelerating autoregressive generation in large language models (LLMs), yet its integration into vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. We introduce DREAM, a novel speculative decoding framework tailored for VLMs that combines three key innovations: (1) a cross-attention-based mechanism to inject intermediate features from the target model into the draft model for improved alignment, (2) adaptive intermediate feature selection based on attention entropy to guide efficient draft model training, and (3) visual token compression to reduce draft model latency. DREAM enables efficient, accurate, and parallel multimodal decoding with significant throughput improvement. Experiments across a diverse set of recent popular VLMs, including LLaVA, Pixtral, SmolVLM and Gemma3, demonstrate up to 3.6x speedup over conventional decoding and significantly outperform prior SD baselines in both inference throughput and speculative draft acceptance length across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/SAI-Lab-NYU/DREAM.git

Abstract: The latency bottleneck of traditional text-to-speech (TTS) systems fundamentally hinders the potential of streaming large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI. These TTS systems, typically trained and inferenced on complete utterances, introduce unacceptable delays, even with optimized inference speeds, when coupled with streaming LLM outputs. This is particularly problematic for creating responsive conversational agents where low first-token latency is critical. In this paper, we present SpeakStream, a streaming TTS system that generates audio incrementally from streaming text using a decoder-only architecture. SpeakStream is trained using a next-step prediction loss on interleaved text-speech data. During inference, it generates speech incrementally while absorbing streaming input text, making it particularly suitable for cascaded conversational AI agents where an LLM streams text to a TTS system. Our experiments demonstrate that SpeakStream achieves state-of-the-art latency results in terms of first-token latency while maintaining the quality of non-streaming TTS systems.

arXiv:2505.19209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We introduce and formally define the novel task of fine-grained scientific hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs' capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4) whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis, progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent chemistry literature show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

<title>When Ethics and Payoffs Diverge: LLM Agents in Morally Charged Social Dilemmas</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use in complex agentic roles, involving decision-making with humans or other agents, making ethical alignment a key AI safety concern. While prior work has examined both LLMs' moral judgment and strategic behavior in social dilemmas, there is limited understanding of how they act when moral imperatives directly conflict with rewards or incentives. To investigate this, we introduce Moral Behavior in Social Dilemma Simulation (MoralSim) and evaluate how LLMs behave in the prisoner's dilemma and public goods game with morally charged contexts. In MoralSim, we test a range of frontier models across both game structures and three distinct moral framings, enabling a systematic examination of how LLMs navigate social dilemmas in which ethical norms conflict with payoff-maximizing strategies. Our results show substantial variation across models in both their general tendency to act morally and the consistency of their behavior across game types, the specific moral framing, and situational factors such as opponent behavior and survival risks. Crucially, no model exhibits consistently moral behavior in MoralSim, highlighting the need for caution when deploying LLMs in agentic roles where the agent's "self-interest" may conflict with ethical expectations. Our code is available at https://github.com/sbackmann/moralsim.

<title>The Overthinker's DIET: Cutting Token Calories with DIfficulty-AwarE Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19217</link>

arXiv:2505.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning but often over-think, generating excessively long responses that hinder efficiency. We introduce DIET ( DIfficulty-AwarE Training), a framework that systematically cuts these "token calories" by integrating on-the-fly problem difficulty into the reinforcement learning (RL) process. DIET dynamically adapts token compression strategies by modulating token penalty strength and conditioning target lengths on estimated task difficulty, to optimize the performance-efficiency trade-off. We also theoretically analyze the pitfalls of naive reward weighting in group-normalized RL algorithms like GRPO, and propose Advantage Weighting technique, which enables stable and effective implementation of these difficulty-aware objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that DIET significantly reduces token counts while simultaneously improving reasoning performance. Beyond raw token reduction, we show two crucial benefits largely overlooked by prior work: (1) DIET leads to superior inference scaling. By maintaining high per-sample quality with fewer tokens, it enables better scaling performance via majority voting with more samples under fixed computational budgets, an area where other methods falter. (2) DIET enhances the natural positive correlation between response length and problem difficulty, ensuring verbosity is appropriately allocated, unlike many existing compression methods that disrupt this relationship. Our analyses provide a principled and effective framework for developing more efficient, practical, and high-performing LLMs.

<title>Evaluating Text Creativity across Diverse Domains: A Dataset and Large Language Model Evaluator</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19236</link>

Abstract: Creativity evaluation remains a challenging frontier for large language models (LLMs). Current evaluations heavily rely on inefficient and costly human judgments, hindering progress in enhancing machine creativity. While automated methods exist, ranging from psychological testing to heuristic- or prompting-based approaches, they often lack generalizability or alignment with human judgment. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel pairwise-comparison framework for assessing textual creativity, leveraging shared contextual instructions to improve evaluation consistency. We introduce CreataSet, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ human-level and 1M+ synthetic creative instruction-response pairs spanning diverse open-domain tasks. Through training on CreataSet, we develop an LLM-based evaluator named CrEval. CrEval demonstrates remarkable superiority over existing methods in alignment with human judgments. Experimental results underscore the indispensable significance of integrating both human-generated and synthetic data in training highly robust evaluators, and showcase the practical utility of CrEval in boosting the creativity of LLMs. We will release all data, code, and models publicly soon to support further research.

<title>LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2505.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) research has grown rapidly, along with increasing concern about their limitations such as failures in reasoning, hallucinations, and limited multilingual capability. In this survey, we conduct a data-driven, semi-automated review of research on limitations of LLM (LLLMs) from 2022 to 2024 using a bottom-up approach. From a corpus of 250,000 ACL and arXiv papers, we identify 14,648 relevant papers using keyword filtering, LLM-based classification, validated against expert labels, and topic clustering (via two approaches, HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM). We find that LLM-related research increases over fivefold in ACL and fourfold in arXiv. Since 2022, LLLMs research grows even faster, reaching over 30% of LLM papers by late 2024. Reasoning remains the most studied limitation, followed by generalization, hallucination, bias, and security. The distribution of topics in the ACL dataset stays relatively stable over time, while arXiv shifts toward safety and controllability (with topics like security risks, alignment, hallucinations, knowledge editing), and multimodality between 2022 and 2024. We release a dataset of annotated abstracts and a validated methodology, and offer a quantitative view of trends in LLM limitations research.

arXiv:2505.19250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large-language models (LLMs) typically adopt a fixed reasoning strategy, either simple or complex, for all questions, regardless of their difficulty. This neglect of variation in task and reasoning process complexity leads to an imbalance between performance and efficiency. Existing methods attempt to implement training-free fast-slow thinking system switching to handle problems of varying difficulty, but are limited by coarse-grained solution-level strategy adjustments. To address this issue, we propose a novel reasoning paradigm: Process-Level Adaptive Thinking Mode Switching (PATS), which enables LLMs to dynamically adjust their reasoning strategy based on the difficulty of each step, optimizing the balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Our approach integrates Process Reward Models (PRMs) with Beam Search, incorporating progressive mode switching and bad-step penalty mechanisms. Experiments on diverse mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our methodology achieves high accuracy while maintaining moderate token usage. This study emphasizes the significance of process-level, difficulty-aware reasoning strategy adaptation, offering valuable insights into efficient inference for LLMs.

arXiv:2505.19254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consumers often face inconsistent product quality, particularly when identical products vary between markets, a situation known as the dual quality problem. To identify and address this issue, automated techniques are needed. This paper explores how natural language processing (NLP) can aid in detecting such discrepancies and presents the full process of developing a solution. First, we describe in detail the creation of a new Polish-language dataset with 1,957 reviews, 540 highlighting dual quality issues. We then discuss experiments with various approaches like SetFit with sentence-transformers, transformer-based encoders, and LLMs, including error analysis and robustness verification. Additionally, we evaluate multilingual transfer using a subset of opinions in English, French, and German. The paper concludes with insights on deployment and practical applications.

<title>A Graph Perspective to Probe Structural Patterns of Knowledge in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have been extensively studied as neural knowledge bases for their knowledge access, editability, reasoning, and explainability. However, few works focus on the structural patterns of their knowledge. Motivated by this gap, we investigate these structural patterns from a graph perspective. We quantify the knowledge of LLMs at both the triplet and entity levels, and analyze how it relates to graph structural properties such as node degree. Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically close entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further motivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity knowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable knowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results show that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior performance.

<title>100-LongBench: Are de facto Long-Context Benchmarks Literally Evaluating Long-Context Ability?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19293</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19293</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context capability is considered one of the most important abilities of LLMs, as a truly long context-capable LLM enables users to effortlessly process many originally exhausting tasks -- e.g., digesting a long-form document to find answers vs. directly asking an LLM about it. However, existing real-task-based long-context evaluation benchmarks have two major shortcomings. First, benchmarks like LongBench often do not provide proper metrics to separate long-context performance from the model's baseline ability, making cross-model comparison unclear. Second, such benchmarks are usually constructed with fixed input lengths, which limits their applicability across different models and fails to reveal when a model begins to break down. To address these issues, we introduce a length-controllable long-context benchmark and a novel metric that disentangles baseline knowledge from true long-context capabilities. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in effectively evaluating LLMs.

<title>A Necessary Step toward Faithfulness: Measuring and Improving Consistency in Free-Text Explanations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faithful free-text explanations are important to ensure transparency in high-stakes AI decision-making contexts, but they are challenging to generate by language models and assess by humans. In this paper, we present a measure for Prediction-EXplanation (PEX) consistency, by extending the concept of weight of evidence. This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation faithfulness. Our analysis reveals that more than 62% explanations generated by large language models lack this consistency. We show that applying direct preference optimization improves the consistency of generated explanations across three model families, with improvement ranging from 43.1% to 292.3%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing this consistency measure can improve explanation faithfulness by up to 9.7%.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their impressive reasoning capabilities. However, the reasoning confined to internal parametric space limits LLMs' access to real-time information and understanding of the physical world. To overcome this constraint, we introduce SituatedThinker, a novel framework that enables LLMs to ground their reasoning in real-world contexts through situated thinking, which adaptively combines both internal knowledge and external information with predefined interfaces. By utilizing reinforcement learning, SituatedThinker incentivizes deliberate reasoning with the real world to acquire information and feedback, allowing LLMs to surpass their knowledge boundaries and enhance reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements on multi-hop question-answering and mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, SituatedThinker demonstrates strong performance on unseen tasks, such as KBQA, TableQA, and text-based games, showcasing the generalizable real-world grounded reasoning capability. Our codes are available at https://github.com/jnanliu/SituatedThinker.

<title>PatentScore: Multi-dimensional Evaluation of LLM-Generated Patent Claims</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) metrics play a central role in evaluating generated texts, but are not well suited for the structural and legal characteristics of patent documents. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential in automating patent generation, yet research on evaluating LLM-generated patents remains limited, especially in evaluating the generation quality of patent claims, which are central to defining the scope of protection. Effective claim evaluation requires addressing legal validity, technical accuracy, and structural compliance. To address this gap, we introduce PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing LLM-generated patent claims. PatentScore incorporates: (1) hierarchical decomposition for claim analysis; (2) domain-specific validation patterns based on legal and technical standards; and (3) scoring across structural, semantic, and legal dimensions. Unlike general-purpose NLG metrics, PatentScore reflects patent-specific constraints and document structures, enabling evaluation beyond surface similarity. We evaluate 400 GPT-4o-mini generated Claim 1s and report a Pearson correlation of $r = 0.819$ with expert annotations, outperforming existing NLG metrics. Furthermore, we conduct additional evaluations using open models such as Claude-3.5-Haiku and Gemini-1.5-flash, all of which show strong correlations with expert judgments, confirming the robustness and generalizability of our framework.

<title>GC-KBVQA: A New Four-Stage Framework for Enhancing Knowledge Based Visual Question Answering Performance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19354</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) methods focus on tasks that demand reasoning with information extending beyond the explicit content depicted in the image. Early methods relied on explicit knowledge bases to provide this auxiliary information. Recent approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as implicit knowledge sources. While KB-VQA methods have demonstrated promising results, their potential remains constrained as the auxiliary text provided may not be relevant to the question context, and may also include irrelevant information that could misguide the answer predictor. We introduce a novel four-stage framework called Grounding Caption-Guided Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (GC-KBVQA), which enables LLMs to effectively perform zero-shot VQA tasks without the need for end-to-end multimodal training. Innovations include grounding question-aware caption generation to move beyond generic descriptions and have compact, yet detailed and context-rich information. This is combined with knowledge from external sources to create highly informative prompts for the LLM. GC-KBVQA can address a variety of VQA tasks, and does not require task-specific fine-tuning, thus reducing both costs and deployment complexity by leveraging general-purpose, pre-trained LLMs. Comparison with competing KB-VQA methods shows significantly improved performance. Our code will be made public.

arXiv:2505.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding true influence in social media requires distinguishing correlation from causation--particularly when analyzing misinformation spread. While existing approaches focus on exposure metrics and network structures, they often fail to capture the causal mechanisms by which external temporal signals trigger engagement. We introduce a novel joint treatment-outcome framework that leverages existing sequential models to simultaneously adapt to both policy timing and engagement effects. Our approach adapts causal inference techniques from healthcare to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATE) within the sequential nature of social media interactions, tackling challenges from external confounding signals. Through our experiments on real-world misinformation and disinformation datasets, we show that our models outperform existing benchmarks by 15--22% in predicting engagement across diverse counterfactual scenarios, including exposure adjustment, timing shifts, and varied intervention durations. Case studies on 492 social media users show our causal effect measure aligns strongly with the gold standard in influence estimation, the expert-based empirical influence.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced tasks like chart understanding. However, these models often suffer from hallucinations, where generated text sequences conflict with the provided visual data. To address this, we introduce Post-Hoc Visual Attribution for Charts, which identifies fine-grained chart elements that validate a given chart-associated response. We propose ChartLens, a novel chart attribution algorithm that uses segmentation-based techniques to identify chart objects and employs set-of-marks prompting with MLLMs for fine-grained visual attribution. Additionally, we present ChartVA-Eval, a benchmark with synthetic and real-world charts from diverse domains like finance, policy, and economics, featuring fine-grained attribution annotations. Our evaluations show that ChartLens improves fine-grained attributions by 26-66%.

<title>Belief Attribution as Mental Explanation: The Role of Accuracy, Informativity, and Causality</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key feature of human theory-of-mind is the ability to attribute beliefs to other agents as mentalistic explanations for their behavior. But given the wide variety of beliefs that agents may hold about the world and the rich language we can use to express them, which specific beliefs are people inclined to attribute to others? In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that people prefer to attribute beliefs that are good explanations for the behavior they observe. We develop a computational model that quantifies the explanatory strength of a (natural language) statement about an agent's beliefs via three factors: accuracy, informativity, and causal relevance to actions, each of which can be computed from a probabilistic generative model of belief-driven behavior. Using this model, we study the role of each factor in how people selectively attribute beliefs to other agents. We investigate this via an experiment where participants watch an agent collect keys hidden in boxes in order to reach a goal, then rank a set of statements describing the agent's beliefs about the boxes' contents. We find that accuracy and informativity perform reasonably well at predicting these rankings when combined, but that causal relevance is the single factor that best explains participants' responses.

Abstract: We present the gradual style adaptor TTS (GSA-TTS) with a novel style encoder that gradually encodes speaking styles from an acoustic reference for zero-shot speech synthesis. GSA first captures the local style of each semantic sound unit. Then the local styles are combined by self-attention to obtain a global style condition. This semantic and hierarchical encoding strategy provides a robust and rich style representation for an acoustic model. We test GSA-TTS on unseen speakers and obtain promising results regarding naturalness, speaker similarity, and intelligibility. Additionally, we explore the potential of GSA in terms of interpretability and controllability, which stems from its hierarchical structure.

arXiv:2505.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code documentation is useful, but writing it is time-consuming. Different techniques for generating code summaries have emerged, but comparing them is difficult because human evaluation is expensive and automatic metrics are unreliable. In this paper, we introduce a simple new baseline in which we ask an LLM to give an overall score to a summary. Unlike n-gram and embedding-based baselines, our approach is able to consider the code when giving a score. This allows us to also make a variant that does not consider the reference summary at all, which could be used for other tasks, e.g., to evaluate the quality of documentation in code bases. We find that our method is as good or better than prior metrics, though we recommend using it in conjunction with embedding-based methods to avoid the risk of LLM-specific bias.

<title>CoTGuard: Using Chain-of-Thought Triggering for Copyright Protection in Multi-Agent LLM Systems</title>

arXiv:2505.19405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents capable of collaborative reasoning and task execution, multi-agent LLM systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems. However, these systems pose new challenges for copyright protection, particularly when sensitive or copyrighted content is inadvertently recalled through inter-agent communication and reasoning. Existing protection techniques primarily focus on detecting content in final outputs, overlooking the richer, more revealing reasoning processes within the agents themselves. In this paper, we introduce CoTGuard, a novel framework for copyright protection that leverages trigger-based detection within Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Specifically, we can activate specific CoT segments and monitor intermediate reasoning steps for unauthorized content reproduction by embedding specific trigger queries into agent prompts. This approach enables fine-grained, interpretable detection of copyright violations in collaborative agent scenarios. We evaluate CoTGuard on various benchmarks in extensive experiments and show that it effectively uncovers content leakage with minimal interference to task performance. Our findings suggest that reasoning-level monitoring offers a promising direction for safeguarding intellectual property in LLM-based agent systems.

<title>Self-Reflective Planning with Knowledge Graphs: Enhancing LLM Reasoning Reliability for Question Answering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19410</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19410</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks, yet they remain prone to hallucinations when reasoning with insufficient internal knowledge. While integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) provides access to structured, verifiable information, existing approaches often generate incomplete or factually inconsistent reasoning paths. To this end, we propose Self-Reflective Planning (SRP), a framework that synergizes LLMs with KGs through iterative, reference-guided reasoning. Specifically, given a question and topic entities, SRP first searches for references to guide planning and reflection. In the planning process, it checks initial relations and generates a reasoning path. After retrieving knowledge from KGs through a reasoning path, it implements iterative reflection by judging the retrieval result and editing the reasoning path until the answer is correctly retrieved. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that SRP surpasses various strong baselines and further underscore its reliable reasoning ability.

<title>The Role of Diversity in In-Context Learning for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a crucial capability of current large language models (LLMs), where the selection of examples plays a key role in performance. While most existing approaches focus on selecting the most similar examples to the query, the impact of diversity in example selection remains underexplored. We systematically investigate the role of diversity in in-context example selection through experiments across a range of tasks, from sentiment classification to more challenging math and code problems. Experiments on Llama-3.1, Gemma-2, and Mistral-v0.3 families of models show that diversity-aware selection methods improve performance, particularly on complex tasks like math and code, and enhance robustness to out-of-distribution queries. To support these findings, we introduce a theoretical framework that explains the benefits of incorporating diversity in in-context example selection.

Common preference alignment methods like DPO excel in static settings, but struggle in dynamic collaborative tasks where the explicit signals of interlocutor beliefs are sparse and skewed. We propose the Frictional Agent Alignment Framework (FAAF), to generate precise, context-aware "friction" that prompts for deliberation and re-examination of existing evidence. FAAF's two-player objective decouples from data skew: a frictive-state policy identifies belief misalignments, while an intervention policy crafts collaborator-preferred responses. We derive an analytical solution to this objective, enabling training a single policy via a simple supervised loss. Experiments on three benchmarks show FAAF outperforms competitors in producing concise, interpretable friction and in OOD generalization. By aligning LLMs to act as adaptive "thought partners" -- not passive responders -- FAAF advances scalable, dynamic human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Podcasts have become daily companions for half a billion users. Given the enormous amount of podcast content available, highlights provide a valuable signal that helps viewers get the gist of an episode and decide if they want to invest in listening to it in its entirety. However, identifying highlights automatically is challenging due to the unstructured and long-form nature of the content. We introduce Rhapsody, a dataset of 13K podcast episodes paired with segment-level highlight scores derived from YouTube's 'most replayed' feature. We frame the podcast highlight detection as a segment-level binary classification task. We explore various baseline approaches, including zero-shot prompting of language models and lightweight finetuned language models using segment-level classification heads. Our experimental results indicate that even state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4o and Gemini struggle with this task, while models finetuned with in-domain data significantly outperform their zero-shot performance. The finetuned model benefits from leveraging both speech signal features and transcripts. These findings highlight the challenges for fine-grained information access in long-form spoken media.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning typically involves considering alternatives to actual events. While often applied to understand past events, a distinct form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making. However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, Fin-Force-FINancial FORward Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing structured evaluation, Fin-Force supports LLM based forward counterfactual generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on Fin-Force, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing their limitations and proposing insights for future research.

<title>Route to Reason: Adaptive Routing for LLM and Reasoning Strategy Selection</title>

Abstract: The inherent capabilities of a language model (LM) and the reasoning strategies it employs jointly determine its performance in reasoning tasks. While test-time scaling is regarded as an effective approach to tackling complex reasoning tasks, it incurs substantial computational costs and often leads to "overthinking", where models become trapped in "thought pitfalls". To address this challenge, we propose Route-To-Reason (RTR), a novel unified routing framework that dynamically allocates both LMs and reasoning strategies according to task difficulty under budget constraints. RTR learns compressed representations of both expert models and reasoning strategies, enabling their joint and adaptive selection at inference time. This method is low-cost, highly flexible, and can be seamlessly extended to arbitrary black-box or white-box models and strategies, achieving true plug-and-play functionality. Extensive experiments across seven open source models and four reasoning strategies demonstrate that RTR achieves an optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency among all baselines, achieving higher accuracy than the best single model while reducing token usage by over 60%.

<title>Surrogate Signals from Format and Length: Reinforcement Learning for Solving Mathematical Problems without Ground Truth Answers</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, with Reinforcement Learning playing a key role in adapting them to specific applications. However, obtaining ground truth answers for training LLMs in mathematical problem-solving is often challenging, costly, and sometimes unfeasible. This research delves into the utilization of format and length as surrogate signals to train LLMs for mathematical problem-solving, bypassing the need for traditional ground truth answers.Our study shows that a reward function centered on format correctness alone can yield performance improvements comparable to the standard GRPO algorithm in early phases. Recognizing the limitations of format-only rewards in the later phases, we incorporate length-based rewards. The resulting GRPO approach, leveraging format-length surrogate signals, not only matches but surpasses the performance of the standard GRPO algorithm relying on ground truth answers in certain scenarios, achieving 40.0\% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model. Through systematic exploration and experimentation, this research not only offers a practical solution for training LLMs to solve mathematical problems and reducing the dependence on extensive ground truth data collection, but also reveals the essence of why our label-free approach succeeds: base model is like an excellent student who has already mastered mathematical and logical reasoning skills, but performs poorly on the test paper, it simply needs to develop good answering habits to achieve outstanding results in exams , in other words, to unlock the capabilities it already possesses.

Abstract: This paper studies the emergence of interpretable categorical features within large language models (LLMs), analyzing their behavior across training checkpoints (time), transformer layers (space), and varying model sizes (scale). Using sparse autoencoders for mechanistic interpretability, we identify when and where specific semantic concepts emerge within neural activations. Results indicate clear temporal and scale-specific thresholds for feature emergence across multiple domains. Notably, spatial analysis reveals unexpected semantic reactivation, with early-layer features re-emerging at later layers, challenging standard assumptions about representational dynamics in transformer models.

<title>Balancing Computation Load and Representation Expressivity in Parallel Hybrid Neural Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19472</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Attention and State-Space Models (SSMs) when combined in a hybrid network in sequence or in parallel provide complementary strengths. In a hybrid sequential pipeline they alternate between applying a transformer to the input and then feeding its output into a SSM. This results in idle periods in the individual components increasing end-to-end latency and lowering throughput caps. In the parallel hybrid architecture, the transformer operates independently in parallel with the SSM, and these pairs are cascaded, with output from one pair forming the input to the next. Two issues are (i) creating an expressive knowledge representation with the inherently divergent outputs from these separate branches, and (ii) load balancing the computation between these parallel branches, while maintaining representation fidelity. In this work we present FlowHN, a novel parallel hybrid network architecture that accommodates various strategies for load balancing, achieved through appropriate distribution of input tokens between the two branches. Two innovative differentiating factors in FlowHN include a FLOP aware dynamic token split between the attention and SSM branches yielding efficient balance in compute load, and secondly, a method to fuse the highly divergent outputs from individual branches for enhancing representation expressivity. Together they enable much better token processing speeds, avoid bottlenecks, and at the same time yield significantly improved accuracy as compared to other competing works. We conduct comprehensive experiments on autoregressive language modeling for models with 135M, 350M, and 1B parameters. FlowHN outperforms sequential hybrid models and its parallel counterpart, achieving up to 4* higher Tokens per Second (TPS) and 2* better Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU).

<title>Continuous Self-Improvement of Large Language Models by Test-time Training with Verifier-Driven Sample Selection</title>

Abstract: Learning to adapt pretrained language models to unlabeled, out-of-distribution data is a critical challenge, as models often falter on structurally novel reasoning tasks even while excelling within their training distribution. We introduce a new framework called VDS-TTT - Verifier-Driven Sample Selection for Test-Time Training to efficiently address this. We use a learned verifier to score a pool of generated responses and select only from high ranking pseudo-labeled examples for fine-tuned adaptation. Specifically, for each input query our LLM generates N candidate answers; the verifier assigns a reliability score to each, and the response with the highest confidence and above a fixed threshold is paired with its query for test-time training. We fine-tune only low-rank LoRA adapter parameters, ensuring adaptation efficiency and fast convergence. Our proposed self-supervised framework is the first to synthesize verifier driven test-time training data for continuous self-improvement of the model. Experiments across three diverse benchmarks and three state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that VDS-TTT yields up to a 32.29% relative improvement over the base model and a 6.66% gain compared to verifier-based methods without test-time training, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency for on-the-fly large language model adaptation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they often exhibit a specific cultural biases, neglecting the values and linguistic diversity of low-resource regions. This cultural bias not only undermines universal equality, but also risks reinforcing stereotypes and perpetuating discrimination. To address this, we propose CulFiT, a novel culturally-aware training paradigm that leverages multilingual data and fine-grained reward modeling to enhance cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. Our approach synthesizes diverse cultural-related questions, constructs critique data in culturally relevant languages, and employs fine-grained rewards to decompose cultural texts into verifiable knowledge units for interpretable evaluation. We also introduce GlobalCultureQA, a multilingual open-ended question-answering dataset designed to evaluate culturally-aware responses in a global context. Extensive experiments on three existing benchmarks and our GlobalCultureQA demonstrate that CulFiT achieves state-of-the-art open-source model performance in cultural alignment and general reasoning.

<title>LLM Meets Scene Graph: Can Large Language Models Understand and Generate Scene Graphs? A Benchmark and Empirical Study</title>

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our benchmark is available at https://tsg-bench.netlify.app. Additionally, our code and evaluation data are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TSG-Bench.

<title>Causal Distillation: Transferring Structured Explanations from Large to Compact Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large proprietary language models exhibit strong causal reasoning abilities that smaller open-source models struggle to replicate. We introduce a novel framework for distilling causal explanations that transfers causal reasoning skills from a powerful teacher model to a compact open-source model. The key idea is to train the smaller model to develop causal reasoning abilities by generating structured cause-and-effect explanations consistent with those of the teacher model. To evaluate the quality of the student-generated explanations, we introduce a new metric called Causal Explanation Coherence (CEC) to assess the structural and logical consistency of causal reasoning. This metric uses sentence-level semantic alignment to measure how well each part of the generated explanation corresponds to the teacher's reference, capturing both faithfulness and coverage of the underlying causal chain. Our framework and the CEC metric provide a principled foundation for training smaller models to perform robust causal reasoning and for systematically assessing the coherence of explanations in language model outputs.

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.

Abstract: We present a critical discourse analysis of the 2024 U.S. presidential debates, examining Donald Trump's rhetorical strategies in his interactions with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We introduce a novel annotation framework, BEADS (Bias Enriched Annotation for Dialogue Structure), which systematically extends the DAMSL framework to capture bias driven and adversarial discourse features in political communication. BEADS includes a domain and language agnostic set of tags that model ideological framing, emotional appeals, and confrontational tactics. Our methodology compares detailed human annotation with zero shot ChatGPT assisted tagging on verified transcripts from the Trump and Biden (19,219 words) and Trump and Harris (18,123 words) debates. Our analysis shows that Trump consistently dominated in key categories: Challenge and Adversarial Exchanges, Selective Emphasis, Appeal to Fear, Political Bias, and Perceived Dismissiveness. These findings underscore his use of emotionally charged and adversarial rhetoric to control the narrative and influence audience perception. In this work, we establish BEADS as a scalable and reproducible framework for critical discourse analysis across languages, domains, and political contexts.

Abstract: Implicit hate speech detection is challenging due to its subtlety and reliance on contextual interpretation rather than explicit offensive words. Current approaches rely on contrastive learning, which are shown to be effective on distinguishing hate and non-hate sentences. Humans, however, detect implicit hate speech by first identifying specific targets within the text and subsequently interpreting how these target relate to their surrounding context. Motivated by this reasoning process, we propose AmpleHate, a novel approach designed to mirror human inference for implicit hate detection. AmpleHate identifies explicit target using a pretrained Named Entity Recognition model and capture implicit target information via [CLS] tokens. It computes attention-based relationships between explicit, implicit targets and sentence context and then, directly injects these relational vectors into the final sentence representation. This amplifies the critical signals of target-context relations for determining implicit hate. Experiments demonstrate that AmpleHate achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming contrastive learning baselines by an average of 82.14% and achieve faster convergence. Qualitative analyses further reveal that attention patterns produced by AmpleHate closely align with human judgement, underscoring its interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) have gained substantial attention due to their ability to execute diverse language tasks successfully while using fewer computer resources. These models are particularly ideal for deployment in limited environments, such as mobile devices, on-device processing, and edge systems. In this study, we present a complete assessment of SLMs, focussing on their design frameworks, training approaches, and techniques for lowering model size and complexity. We offer a novel classification system to organize the optimization approaches applied for SLMs, encompassing strategies like pruning, quantization, and model compression. Furthermore, we assemble SLM's studies of evaluation suite with some existing datasets, establishing a rigorous platform for measuring SLM capabilities. Alongside this, we discuss the important difficulties that remain unresolved in this sector, including trade-offs between efficiency and performance, and we suggest directions for future study. We anticipate this study to serve as a beneficial guide for researchers and practitioners who aim to construct compact, efficient, and high-performing language models.

arXiv:2505.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing medical RAG systems mainly leverage knowledge from medical knowledge bases, neglecting the crucial role of experiential knowledge derived from similar patient cases -- a key component of human clinical reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.

<title>How Syntax Specialization Emerges in Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been found to develop surprising internal specializations: Individual neurons, attention heads, and circuits become selectively sensitive to syntactic structure, reflecting patterns observed in the human brain. While this specialization is well-documented, how it emerges during training and what influences its development remains largely unknown.
  In this work, we tap into the black box of specialization by tracking its formation over time. By quantifying internal syntactic consistency across minimal pairs from various syntactic phenomena, we identify a clear developmental trajectory: Syntactic sensitivity emerges gradually, concentrates in specific layers, and exhibits a 'critical period' of rapid internal specialization. This process is consistent across architectures and initialization parameters (e.g., random seeds), and is influenced by model scale and training data. We therefore reveal not only where syntax arises in LLMs but also how some models internalize it during training. To support future research, we will release the code, models, and training checkpoints upon acceptance.

<title>Towards Multi-Granularity Memory Association and Selection for Long-Term Conversational Agents</title>

arXiv:2505.19549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been widely adopted in conversational agents. However, the increasingly long interactions between users and agents accumulate extensive dialogue records, making it difficult for LLMs with limited context windows to maintain a coherent long-term dialogue memory and deliver personalized responses. While retrieval-augmented memory systems have emerged to address this issue, existing methods often depend on single-granularity memory segmentation and retrieval. This approach falls short in capturing deep memory connections, leading to partial retrieval of useful information or substantial noise, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these limits, we propose MemGAS, a framework that enhances memory consolidation by constructing multi-granularity association, adaptive selection, and retrieval. MemGAS is based on multi-granularity memory units and employs Gaussian Mixture Models to cluster and associate new memories with historical ones. An entropy-based router adaptively selects optimal granularity by evaluating query relevance distributions and balancing information completeness and noise. Retrieved memories are further refined via LLM-based filtering. Experiments on four long-term memory benchmarks demonstrate that MemGAS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both question answer and retrieval tasks, achieving superior performance across different query types and top-K settings.

Abstract: Model editing aims to correct errors and outdated knowledge in the Large language models (LLMs) with minimal cost. Prior research has proposed a variety of datasets to assess the effectiveness of these model editing methods. However, most existing datasets only require models to output short phrases or sentences, overlooks the widespread existence of document-level tasks in the real world, raising doubts about their practical usability. Aimed at addressing this limitation and promoting the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the task of document-level model editing. To tackle such challenges and enhance model capabilities in practical settings, we introduce \benchmarkname, a dataset focused on document-level model editing, characterized by document-level inputs and outputs, extrapolative, and multiple facts within a single edit. We propose a series of evaluation metrics and experiments. The results show that the difficulties in document-level model editing pose challenges for existing model editing methods.

<title>TailorKV: A Hybrid Framework for Long-Context Inference via Tailored KV Cache Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19586</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache in generative large language models (LLMs) introduces substantial memory overhead. Existing works mitigate this burden by offloading or compressing the KV cache. However, loading the entire cache incurs significant latency due to PCIe bandwidth bottlenecks in CPU-GPU communication, while aggressive compression causes notable performance degradation. We identify that certain layers in the LLM need to maintain global information and are unsuitable for selective loading. In contrast, other layers primarily focus on a few tokens with dominant activations that potentially incur substantial quantization error. This observation leads to a key insight that loading dominant tokens and quantizing all tokens can complement each other. Building on this insight, we propose a hybrid compression method, TailorKV, which seamlessly integrates quantization and offloading. TailorKV develops an inference framework along with a hardware-friendly implementation that leverages these complementary characteristics. Extensive long-context evaluations exhibit that TailorKV achieves nearly lossless performance under aggressive compression settings, outperforming the state-of-the-art. Particularly, the Llama-3.1-8B with 128k context can be served within a single RTX 3090 GPU, reaching 82 ms per token during decoding.

<title>Multi-Agent Collaboration via Evolving Orchestration</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks, but their monolithic nature restricts scalability and efficiency in complex problem-solving. While recent research explores multi-agent collaboration among LLMs, most approaches rely on static organizational structures that struggle to adapt as task complexity and agent numbers grow, resulting in coordination overhead and inefficiencies. To this end, we propose a puppeteer-style paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration, where a centralized orchestrator ("puppeteer") dynamically directs agents ("puppets") in response to evolving task states. This orchestrator is trained via reinforcement learning to adaptively sequence and prioritize agents, enabling flexible and evolvable collective reasoning. Experiments on closed- and open-domain scenarios show that this method achieves superior performance with reduced computational costs. Analyses further reveal that the key improvements consistently stem from the emergence of more compact, cyclic reasoning structures under the orchestrator's evolution.

<title>Evaluating Robustness of Large Audio Language Models to Audio Injection: An Empirical Study</title>

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, yet their robustness against malicious audio injection attacks remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates five leading LALMs across four attack scenarios: Audio Interference Attack, Instruction Following Attack, Context Injection Attack, and Judgment Hijacking Attack. Using metrics like Defense Success Rate, Context Robustness Score, and Judgment Robustness Index, their vulnerabilities and resilience were quantitatively assessed. Experimental results reveal significant performance disparities among models; no single model consistently outperforms others across all attack types. The position of malicious content critically influences attack effectiveness, particularly when placed at the beginning of sequences. A negative correlation between instruction-following capability and robustness suggests models adhering strictly to instructions may be more susceptible, contrasting with greater resistance by safety-aligned models. Additionally, system prompts show mixed effectiveness, indicating the need for tailored strategies. This work introduces a benchmark framework and highlights the importance of integrating robustness into training pipelines. Findings emphasize developing multi-modal defenses and architectural designs that decouple capability from susceptibility for secure LALMs deployment.

Abstract: Typical methods for evaluating the performance of language models evaluate their ability to answer questions accurately. These evaluation metrics are acceptable for determining the extent to which language models can understand and reason about text in a general sense, but fail to capture nuanced capabilities, such as the ability of language models to recognize and obey rare grammar points, particularly in languages other than English. We measure the perplexity of language models when confronted with the "first person psych predicate restriction" grammar point in Japanese. Weblab is the only tested open source model in the 7-10B parameter range which consistently assigns higher perplexity to ungrammatical psych predicate sentences than grammatical ones. We give evidence that Weblab's uniformly bad tokenization is a possible root cause for its good performance, and show that Llama 3's perplexity on grammatical psych predicate sentences can be reduced by orders of magnitude (28x difference) by restricting test sentences to those with uniformly well-behaved tokenizations. We show in further experiments on machine translation tasks that language models will use alternative grammar patterns in order to produce grammatical sentences when tokenization issues prevent the most natural sentence from being output.

Abstract: Machine translation has become a critical tool in bridging linguistic gaps, especially between languages as diverse as English and Hindi. This paper comprehensively evaluates various machine translation models for translating between English and Hindi. We assess the performance of these models using a diverse set of automatic evaluation metrics, both lexical and machine learning-based metrics. Our evaluation leverages an 18000+ corpus of English Hindi parallel dataset and a custom FAQ dataset comprising questions from government websites. The study aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of different machine translation approaches in handling both general and specialized language domains. Results indicate varying performance levels across different metrics, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement in current translation systems.

<title>Languages in Multilingual Speech Foundation Models Align Both Phonetically and Semantically</title>

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment in pretrained language models (LMs) has enabled efficient transfer in text-based LMs. Such an alignment has also been observed in speech foundation models. However, it remains an open question whether findings and methods from text-based cross-lingual alignment apply to speech. Building on prior work on spoken translation retrieval, we perform pronunciation-controlled experiments to observe if cross-lingual alignment can indeed occur in such models on a semantic basis, instead of relying on phonetic similarities. Our findings indicate that even in the absence of phonetic cues, spoken translation retrieval accuracy remains relatively stable. We follow up with a controlled experiment on a word-level dataset of cross-lingual synonyms and near-homophones, confirming the existence of both phonetic and semantic knowledge in the encoder. Finally, we qualitatively examine the transcriptions produced by early exiting the encoder, where we observe that speech translation produces semantic errors that are characterized by phonetic similarities to corresponding words in the source language. We apply this insight from early exiting to speech recognition in seven low-resource languages unsupported by the Whisper model, and achieve improved accuracy in all languages examined, particularly for languages with transparent orthographies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize smart home assistants by enhancing their ability to accurately understand user needs and respond appropriately, which is extremely beneficial for building a smarter home environment. While recent studies have explored integrating LLMs into smart home systems, they primarily focus on handling straightforward, valid single-device operation instructions. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex and often involve users issuing invalid instructions or controlling multiple devices simultaneously. These have two main challenges: LLMs must accurately identify and rectify errors in user instructions and execute multiple user instructions perfectly. To address these challenges and advance the development of LLM-based smart home assistants, we introduce HomeBench, the first smart home dataset with valid and invalid instructions across single and multiple devices in this paper. We have experimental results on 13 distinct LLMs; e.g., GPT-4o achieves only a 0.0% success rate in the scenario of invalid multi-device instructions, revealing that the existing state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well in this situation even with the help of in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuning. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/BITHLP/HomeBench.

<title>DoctorAgent-RL: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Reinforcement Learning System for Multi-Turn Clinical Dialogue</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19630</link>

arXiv:2505.19630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Existing systems rely on a one-way information transmission mode where patients must fully describe their symptoms in a single round, leading to nonspecific diagnostic recommendations when complaints are vague. Traditional multi-turn dialogue methods based on supervised learning are constrained by static data-driven paradigms, lacking generalizability and struggling to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose DoctorAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that DoctorAgent-RL outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance, demonstrating practical value in assisting clinical consultations. https://github.com/JarvisUSTC/DoctorAgent-RL

Abstract: Word segmentation stands as a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Based on the concept of "comprehend first, segment later", we propose a new framework to explore the limit of unsupervised word segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs based on word segmentation. We employ current mainstream LLMs to perform word segmentation across multiple languages to assess LLMs' "comprehension". Our findings reveal that LLMs are capable of following simple prompts to segment raw text into words. There is a trend suggesting that models with more parameters tend to perform better on multiple languages. Additionally, we introduce a novel unsupervised method, termed LLACA ($\textbf{L}$arge $\textbf{L}$anguage Model-Inspired $\textbf{A}$ho-$\textbf{C}$orasick $\textbf{A}$utomaton). Leveraging the advanced pattern recognition capabilities of Aho-Corasick automata, LLACA innovatively combines these with the deep insights of well-pretrained LLMs. This approach not only enables the construction of a dynamic $n$-gram model that adjusts based on contextual information but also integrates the nuanced understanding of LLMs, offering significant improvements over traditional methods.

<title>Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding. By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances large language models' (LLM) reasoning capabilities. However, the extensive reasoning traces lead to inefficiencies and an increased time-to-first-token (TTFT). We propose a novel training paradigm that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to guide reasoning LLMs to interleave thinking and answering for multi-hop questions. We observe that models inherently possess the ability to perform interleaved reasoning, which can be further enhanced through RL. We introduce a simple yet effective rule-based reward to incentivize correct intermediate steps, which guides the policy model toward correct reasoning paths by leveraging intermediate signals generated during interleaved reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted across five diverse datasets and three RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++) demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional think-answer reasoning, without requiring external tools. Specifically, our approach reduces TTFT by over 80% on average and improves up to 19.3% in Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore, our method, trained solely on question answering and logical reasoning datasets, exhibits strong generalization ability to complex reasoning datasets such as MATH, GPQA, and MMLU. Additionally, we conduct in-depth analysis to reveal several valuable insights into conditional reward modeling.

Abstract: Automatic related work generation (RWG) can save people's time and effort when writing a draft of related work section (RWS) for further revision. However, existing methods for RWG always suffer from shallow comprehension due to taking the limited portions of references papers as input and isolated explanation for each reference due to ineffective capturing the relationships among them. To address these issues, we focus on full-text-based RWG task and propose a novel multi-agent framework. Our framework consists of three agents: a selector that decides which section of the papers is going to read next, a reader that digests the selected section and updates a shared working memory, and a writer that generates RWS based on the final curated memory. To better capture the relationships among references, we also propose two graph-aware strategies for selector, enabling to optimize the reading order with constrains of the graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently improves performance across three base models and various input configurations. The graph-aware selectors outperform alternative selectors, achieving state-of-the-art results. The code and data are available at https://github.com/1190200817/Full_Text_RWG.

Abstract: Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) represents a cornerstone in natural language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting answers from unstructured textual data. With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent understanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared to traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically, we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO, and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately against the ground truth.

Abstract: Legal consultation is essential for safeguarding individual rights and ensuring access to justice, yet remains costly and inaccessible to many individuals due to the shortage of professionals. While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward scalable, low-cost legal assistance, current systems fall short in handling the interactive and knowledge-intensive nature of real-world consultations. To address these challenges, we introduce LeCoDe, a real-world multi-turn benchmark dataset comprising 3,696 legal consultation dialogues with 110,008 dialogue turns, designed to evaluate and improve LLMs' legal consultation capability. With LeCoDe, we innovatively collect live-streamed consultations from short-video platforms, providing authentic multi-turn legal consultation dialogues. The rigorous annotation by legal experts further enhances the dataset with professional insights and expertise. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' consultation capabilities in terms of (1) clarification capability and (2) professional advice quality. This unified framework incorporates 12 metrics across two dimensions. Through extensive experiments on various general and domain-specific LLMs, our results reveal significant challenges in this task, with even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 achieving only 39.8% recall for clarification and 59% overall score for advice quality, highlighting the complexity of professional consultation scenarios. Based on these findings, we further explore several strategies to enhance LLMs' legal consultation abilities. Our benchmark contributes to advancing research in legal domain dialogue systems, particularly in simulating more real-world user-expert interactions.

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have extended the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling audio-based human interactions. However, recent research has revealed that LALMs remain vulnerable to harmful queries due to insufficient safety-alignment. Despite advances in defence measures for text and vision LLMs, effective safety-alignment strategies and audio-safety dataset specifically targeting LALMs are notably absent. Meanwhile defence measures based on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) struggle to address safety improvement while avoiding over-rejection issues, significantly compromising helpfulness. In this work, we propose an unsupervised safety-fine-tuning strategy as remedy that reshapes model's representation space to enhance existing LALMs safety-alignment while balancing the risk of over-rejection. Our experiments, conducted across three generations of Qwen LALMs, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves LALMs safety under three modality input conditions (audio-text, text-only, and audio-only) while increasing over-rejection rate by only 0.88% on average. Warning: this paper contains harmful examples.

Abstract: As the impact of large language models increases, understanding the moral values they reflect becomes ever more important. Assessing the nature of moral values as understood by these models via direct prompting is challenging due to potential leakage of human norms into model training data, and their sensitivity to prompt formulation. Instead, we propose to use word associations, which have been shown to reflect moral reasoning in humans, as low-level underlying representations to obtain a more robust picture of LLMs' moral reasoning. We study moral differences in associations from western English-speaking communities and LLMs trained predominantly on English data. First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling an existing data set of human word associations. Next, we propose a novel method to propagate moral values based on seed words derived from Moral Foundation Theory through the human and LLM-generated association graphs. Finally, we compare the resulting moral conceptualizations, highlighting detailed but systematic differences between moral values emerging from English speakers and LLM associations.

Abstract: The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs) have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30% respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is available on Github.

<title>Grounding Language with Vision: A Conditional Mutual Information Calibrated Decoding Strategy for Reducing Hallucinations in LVLMs</title>

arXiv:2505.19678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, where generated responses seem semantically plausible yet exhibit little or no relevance to the input image. Previous studies reveal that this issue primarily stems from LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors while disregarding the visual information during decoding. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a novel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding strategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated texts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods solely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the contributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination mitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual information. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that dynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining maximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image tokens most pertinent to the generated response. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks reveal that the proposed method significantly reduces hallucinations in LVLMs while preserving decoding efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents KIT's submissions to the IWSLT 2025 low-resource track. We develop both cascaded systems, consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) models, and end-to-end (E2E) Speech Translation (ST) systems for three language pairs: Bemba, North Levantine Arabic, and Tunisian Arabic into English. Building upon pre-trained models, we fine-tune our systems with different strategies to utilize resources efficiently. This study further explores system enhancement with synthetic data and model regularization. Specifically, we investigate MT-augmented ST by generating translations from ASR data using MT models. For North Levantine, which lacks parallel ST training data, a system trained solely on synthetic data slightly surpasses the cascaded system trained on real data. We also explore augmentation using text-to-speech models by generating synthetic speech from MT data, demonstrating the benefits of synthetic data in improving both ASR and ST performance for Bemba. Additionally, we apply intra-distillation to enhance model performance. Our experiments show that this approach consistently improves results across ASR, MT, and ST tasks, as well as across different pre-trained models. Finally, we apply Minimum Bayes Risk decoding to combine the cascaded and end-to-end systems, achieving an improvement of approximately 1.5 BLEU points.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has increased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However, traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models, making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, especially during multi-hop and reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematical problem solving. While Outcome Reward Models verify only final answers, Process Reward Models (PRMs) score each intermediate step to steer generation toward coherent solutions. We introduce PathFinder-PRM, a novel hierarchical, error-aware discriminative PRM that first classifies math and consistency errors at each step, then combines these fine-grained signals to estimate step correctness. To train PathFinder-PRM, we construct a 400K-sample dataset by enriching the human-annotated PRM800K corpus and RLHFlow Mistral traces with three-dimensional step-level labels. On PRMBench, PathFinder-PRM achieves a new state-of-the-art PRMScore of 67.7, outperforming the prior best (65.5) while using 3 times less data. When applied to reward guided greedy search, our model yields prm@8 48.3, a +1.5 point gain over the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that decoupled error detection and reward estimation not only boost fine-grained error detection but also substantially improve end-to-end, reward-guided mathematical reasoning with greater data efficiency.

<title>MT$^{3}$: Scaling MLLM-based Text Image Machine Translation via Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT)-the task of translating textual content embedded in images-is critical for applications in accessibility, cross-lingual information access, and real-world document understanding. However, TIMT remains a complex challenge due to the need for accurate optical character recognition (OCR), robust visual-text reasoning, and high-quality translation, often requiring cascading multi-stage pipelines. Recent advances in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) have improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), but their application to end-to-end TIMT is still underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT$^{3}$, the first framework to apply Multi-Task RL to MLLMs for end-to-end TIMT. MT$^{3}$ adopts a multi-task optimization paradigm targeting three key sub-skills: text recognition, context-aware reasoning, and translation. It is trained using a novel multi-mixed reward mechanism that adapts rule-based RL strategies to TIMT's intricacies, offering fine-grained, non-binary feedback across tasks. Furthermore, to facilitate the evaluation of TIMT in authentic cross-cultural and real-world social media contexts, we introduced XHSPost, the first social media TIMT benchmark. Our MT$^{3}$-7B-Zero achieves state-of-the-art results on the latest in-domain MIT-10M benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B by notable margins across multiple metrics. Additionally, the model shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution language pairs and datasets. In-depth analyses reveal how multi-task synergy, reinforcement learning initialization, curriculum design, and reward formulation contribute to advancing MLLM-driven TIMT.

<title>Graceful Forgetting in Generative Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19715</link>

Abstract: Recently, the pretrain-finetune paradigm has become a cornerstone in various deep learning areas. While in general the pre-trained model would promote both effectiveness and efficiency of downstream tasks fine-tuning, studies have shown that not all knowledge acquired during pre-training is beneficial. Some of the knowledge may actually bring detrimental effects to the fine-tuning tasks, which is also known as negative transfer. To address this problem, graceful forgetting has emerged as a promising approach. The core principle of graceful forgetting is to enhance the learning plasticity of the target task by selectively discarding irrelevant knowledge. However, this approach remains underexplored in the context of generative language models, and it is often challenging to migrate existing forgetting algorithms to these models due to architecture incompatibility. To bridge this gap, in this paper we propose a novel framework, Learning With Forgetting (LWF), to achieve graceful forgetting in generative language models. With Fisher Information Matrix weighting the intended parameter updates, LWF computes forgetting confidence to evaluate self-generated knowledge regarding the forgetting task, and consequently, knowledge with high confidence is periodically unlearned during fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that, although thoroughly uncovering the mechanisms of knowledge interaction remains challenging in pre-trained language models, applying graceful forgetting can contribute to enhanced fine-tuning performance.

<title>Distilling Closed-Source LLM's Knowledge for Locally Stable and Economic Biomedical Entity Linking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19722</link>

Abstract: Biomedical entity linking aims to map nonstandard entities to standard entities in a knowledge base. Traditional supervised methods perform well but require extensive annotated data to transfer, limiting their usage in low-resource scenarios. Large language models (LLMs), especially closed-source LLMs, can address these but risk stability issues and high economic costs: using these models is restricted by commercial companies and brings significant economic costs when dealing with large amounts of data. To address this, we propose ``RPDR'', a framework combining closed-source LLMs and open-source LLMs for re-ranking candidates retrieved by a retriever fine-tuned with a small amount of data. By prompting a closed-source LLM to generate training data from unannotated data and fine-tuning an open-source LLM for re-ranking, we effectively distill the knowledge to the open-source LLM that can be deployed locally, thus avoiding the stability issues and the problem of high economic costs. We evaluate RPDR on two datasets, including one real-world dataset and one publicly available dataset involving two languages: Chinese and English. RPDR achieves 0.019 Acc@1 improvement and 0.036 Acc@1 improvement on the Aier dataset and the Ask A Patient dataset when the amount of training data is not enough. The results demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the proposed framework.

<title>Token-level Accept or Reject: A Micro Alignment Approach for Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19743</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning these models with human preferences and values is critical to ensuring ethical and safe applications. However, existing alignment techniques such as RLHF or DPO often require direct fine-tuning on LLMs with billions of parameters, resulting in substantial computational costs and inefficiencies. To address this, we propose Micro token-level Accept-Reject Aligning (MARA) approach designed to operate independently of the language models. MARA simplifies the alignment process by decomposing sentence-level preference learning into token-level binary classification, where a compact three-layer fully-connected network determines whether candidate tokens are "Accepted" or "Rejected" as part of the response. Extensive experiments across seven different LLMs and three open-source datasets show that MARA achieves significant improvements in alignment performance while reducing computational costs.

<title>NeuSym-RAG: Hybrid Neural Symbolic Retrieval with Multiview Structuring for PDF Question Answering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19754</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of academic papers poses significant challenges for researchers to efficiently acquire key details. While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g., sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including a self-annotated one AIRQA-REAL, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the vector-based RAG and various structured baselines, highlighting its capacity to unify both retrieval schemes and utilize multiple views. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/X-LANCE/NeuSym-RAG.

<title>Efficient Reasoning via Chain of Unconscious Thought</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve promising performance but compromise token efficiency due to verbose reasoning processes. Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT) posits that complex problems can be solved more efficiently through internalized cognitive processes. Inspired by UTT, we propose a new reasoning paradigm, termed Chain of Unconscious Thought (CoUT), to improve the token efficiency of LRMs by guiding them to mimic human unconscious thought and internalize reasoning processes. Concretely, we first prompt the model to internalize the reasoning by thinking in the hidden layer. Then, we design a bag of token-efficient strategies to further help models reduce unnecessary tokens yet preserve the performance. Our work reveals that models may possess beneficial unconscious thought, enabling improved efficiency without sacrificing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CoUT. Remarkably, it surpasses CoT by reducing token usage by 47.62% while maintaining comparable accuracy, as shown in Figure 1. The code of CoUT is available at this link: https://github.com/Rohan-GRH/CoUT

arXiv:2505.19766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with deployment-specific requirements is critical but inherently imperfect. Despite extensive training, models remain susceptible to misalignment and adversarial inputs such as jailbreaks. Content moderation filters are commonly used as external safeguards, though they typically focus narrowly on safety. We introduce SGM (Specification-Guided Moderation), a flexible framework for training moderation filters grounded in user-defined specifications that go beyond standard safety concerns. SGM automates training data generation without relying on human-written examples, enabling scalable support for diverse, application-specific alignment goals. SGM-trained filters perform on par with state-of-the-art safety filters built on curated datasets, while supporting fine-grained and user-defined alignment control.

<title>T^2Agent A Tool-augmented Multimodal Misinformation Detection Agent with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19768</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19768</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources, requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis. Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be released.

<title>What Really Matters in Many-Shot Attacks? An Empirical Study of Long-Context Vulnerabilities in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19773</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate long-context vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) through Many-Shot Jailbreaking (MSJ). Our experiments utilize context length of up to 128K tokens. Through comprehensive analysis with various many-shot attack settings with different instruction styles, shot density, topic, and format, we reveal that context length is the primary factor determining attack effectiveness. Critically, we find that successful attacks do not require carefully crafted harmful content. Even repetitive shots or random dummy text can circumvent model safety measures, suggesting fundamental limitations in long-context processing capabilities of LLMs. The safety behavior of well-aligned models becomes increasingly inconsistent with longer contexts. These findings highlight significant safety gaps in context expansion capabilities of LLMs, emphasizing the need for new safety mechanisms.

<title>Analyzing Political Bias in LLMs via Target-Oriented Sentiment Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political biases encoded by LLMs might have detrimental effects on downstream applications. Existing bias analysis methods rely on small-size intermediate tasks (questionnaire answering or political content generation) and rely on the LLMs themselves for analysis, thus propagating bias. We propose a new approach leveraging the observation that LLM sentiment predictions vary with the target entity in the same sentence. We define an entropy-based inconsistency metric to encode this prediction variability. We insert 1319 demographically and politically diverse politician names in 450 political sentences and predict target-oriented sentiment using seven models in six widely spoken languages. We observe inconsistencies in all tested combinations and aggregate them in a statistically robust analysis at different granularity levels. We observe positive and negative bias toward left and far-right politicians and positive correlations between politicians with similar alignment. Bias intensity is higher for Western languages than for others. Larger models exhibit stronger and more consistent biases and reduce discrepancies between similar languages. We partially mitigate LLM unreliability in target-oriented sentiment classification (TSC) by replacing politician names with fictional but plausible counterparts.

<title>The Avengers: A Simple Recipe for Uniting Smaller Language Models to Challenge Proprietary Giants</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As proprietary giants increasingly dominate the race for ever-larger language models, a pressing question arises for the open-source community: can smaller models remain competitive across a broad range of tasks? In this paper, we present the Avengers--a simple recipe that effectively leverages the collective intelligence of open-source, smaller language models. Our framework is built upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster; and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the response using the Self-Consistency or its multi-model variant. Remarkably, with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers collectively outperforms GPT-4.1 on 10 out of 15 datasets (spanning mathematics, code, logic, knowledge, and affective tasks). In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble strategies, and values of its sole parameter--the number of clusters. We have open-sourced the code on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhangYiqun018/Avengers

Abstract: Metadata extraction is essential for cataloging and preserving datasets, enabling effective research discovery and reproducibility, especially given the current exponential growth in scientific research. While Masader (Alyafeai et al.,2021) laid the groundwork for extracting a wide range of metadata attributes from Arabic NLP datasets' scholarly articles, it relies heavily on manual annotation. In this paper, we present MOLE, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically extract metadata attributes from scientific papers covering datasets of languages other than Arabic. Our schema-driven methodology processes entire documents across multiple input formats and incorporates robust validation mechanisms for consistent output. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to evaluate the research progress on this task. Through systematic analysis of context length, few-shot learning, and web browsing integration, we demonstrate that modern LLMs show promising results in automating this task, highlighting the need for further future work improvements to ensure consistent and reliable performance. We release the code: https://github.com/IVUL-KAUST/MOLE and dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/IVUL-KAUST/MOLE for the research community.

arXiv:2505.19804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, regulatory compliance has become a cornerstone of corporate governance, ensuring adherence to systematic legal frameworks. At its core, financial regulations often comprise highly intricate provisions, layered logical structures, and numerous exceptions, which inevitably result in labor-intensive or comprehension challenges. To mitigate this, recent Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in automating the conversion of regulatory text into executable compliance logic. However, their performance remains suboptimal particularly when applied to Chinese-language financial regulations, due to three key limitations: (1) incomplete domain-specific knowledge representation, (2) insufficient hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and (3) failure to maintain temporal and logical coherence. One promising solution is to develop a domain specific and code-oriented datasets for model training. Existing datasets such as LexGLUE, LegalBench, and CODE-ACCORD are often English-focused, domain-mismatched, or lack fine-grained granularity for compliance code generation. To fill these gaps, we present Compliance-to-Code, the first large-scale Chinese dataset dedicated to financial regulatory compliance. Covering 1,159 annotated clauses from 361 regulations across ten categories, each clause is modularly structured with four logical elements-subject, condition, constraint, and contextual information-along with regulation relations. We provide deterministic Python code mappings, detailed code reasoning, and code explanations to facilitate automated auditing. To demonstrate utility, we present FinCheck: a pipeline for regulation structuring, code generation, and report generation.

Abstract: Consciousness stands as one of the most profound and distinguishing features of the human mind, fundamentally shaping our understanding of existence and agency. As large language models (LLMs) develop at an unprecedented pace, questions concerning intelligence and consciousness have become increasingly significant. However, discourse on LLM consciousness remains largely unexplored territory. In this paper, we first clarify frequently conflated terminologies (e.g., LLM consciousness and LLM awareness). Then, we systematically organize and synthesize existing research on LLM consciousness from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Furthermore, we highlight potential frontier risks that conscious LLMs might introduce. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline future directions in this emerging field. The references discussed in this paper are organized at https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/Awesome-LLM-Consciousness.

arXiv:2505.19815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for comprehending the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through the perspective of meta-learning. By conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical insights for improving these models through established meta-learning techniques.

Abstract: Researchers working on low-resource languages face persistent challenges due to limited data availability and restricted access to computational resources. Although most large language models (LLMs) are predominantly trained in high-resource languages, adapting them to low-resource contexts, particularly African languages, requires specialized techniques. Several strategies have emerged for adapting models to low-resource languages in todays LLM landscape, defined by multi-stage pre-training and post-training paradigms. However, the most effective approaches remain uncertain. This work systematically investigates which adaptation strategies yield the best performance when extending existing LLMs to African languages. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate different combinations of data types (translated versus synthetically generated), training stages (pre-training versus post-training), and other model adaptation configurations. Our experiments focuses on mathematical reasoning tasks, using the Llama 3.1 model family as our base model.

Abstract: Transliteration, the process of mapping text from one script to another, plays a crucial role in multilingual natural language processing, especially within linguistically diverse contexts such as India. Despite significant advancements through specialized models like IndicXlit, recent developments in large language models suggest a potential for general-purpose models to excel at this task without explicit task-specific training. The current work systematically evaluates the performance of prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1, Gemma-3-27B-it, and Mistral-Large against IndicXlit, a state-of-the-art transliteration model, across ten major Indian languages. Experiments utilized standard benchmarks, including Dakshina and Aksharantar datasets, with performance assessed via Top-1 Accuracy and Character Error Rate. Our findings reveal that while GPT family models generally outperform other LLMs and IndicXlit for most instances. Additionally, fine-tuning GPT-4o improves performance on specific languages notably. An extensive error analysis and robustness testing under noisy conditions further elucidate strengths of LLMs compared to specialized models, highlighting the efficacy of foundational models for a wide spectrum of specialized applications with minimal overhead.

<title>REA-RL: Reflection-Aware Online Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Large Reasoning Models</title>

arXiv:2505.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance in complex tasks but often face the challenge of overthinking, leading to substantially high inference costs. Existing approaches synthesize shorter reasoning responses for LRMs to learn, but are inefficient for online usage due to the time-consuming data generation and filtering processes. Meanwhile, online reinforcement learning mainly adopts a length reward to encourage short reasoning responses, but tends to lose the reflection ability and harm the performance. To address these issues, we propose REA-RL, which introduces a small reflection model for efficient scaling in online training, offering both parallel sampling and sequential revision. Besides, a reflection reward is designed to further prevent LRMs from favoring short yet non-reflective responses. Experiments show that both methods maintain or enhance performance while significantly improving inference efficiency. Their combination achieves a good balance between performance and efficiency, reducing inference costs by 35% without compromising performance. Further analysis demonstrates that our methods are effective by maintaining reflection frequency for hard problems while appropriately reducing it for simpler ones without losing reflection ability. Codes are available at https://github.com/hexuandeng/REA-RL.

On news summarization, APE achieves 40 percent BLEU improvement using just a T4 GPU in 60 minutes, matching or exceeding more complex methods like LoRA while remaining conceptually simple. Our approach is particularly valuable for researchers and practitioners with limited computational resources. We provide open-source code and demonstrate APE's effectiveness through both automatic metrics and human evaluation. While inspired by evolutionary theory's "adjacent possible", APE's core insight has a very practical application: small, iterative data perturbations can efficiently guide LLMs toward task-specific performance without expensive retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, excel at advanced reasoning tasks like math and coding via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but still struggle with puzzles solvable by humans without domain knowledge. We introduce Enigmata, the first comprehensive suite tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills. It includes 36 tasks across seven categories, each with 1) a generator that produces unlimited examples with controllable difficulty and 2) a rule-based verifier for automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable, multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration. We further propose Enigmata-Eval, a rigorous benchmark, and develop optimized multi-task RLVR strategies. Our trained model, Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata, consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks like Enigmata-Eval, ARC-AGI (32.8%), and ARC-AGI 2 (0.6%). It also generalizes well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little multi-tasking trade-off. When trained on larger models like Seed1.5-Thinking (20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), puzzle data from Enigmata further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks such as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization benefits of Enigmata. This work offers a unified, controllable framework for advancing logical reasoning in LLMs. Resources of this work can be found at https://seed-enigmata.github.io.

<title>ALAS: Measuring Latent Speech-Text Alignment For Spoken Language Understanding In Multimodal LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). Recent SLU models process audio directly by adapting speech input into LLMs for better multimodal learning. A key consideration for these models is the cross-modal alignment between text and audio modalities, which is a telltale sign as to whether or not LLM is able to associate semantic meaning to audio segments. While various methods exist for fusing these modalities, there is no standard metric to evaluate alignment quality in LLMs. In this work, we propose a new metric, ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score). Our study examines the correlation between audio and text representations across transformer layers, for two different tasks (Spoken Question Answering and Emotion Recognition). We showcase that our metric behaves as expected across different layers and different tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Long Context Understanding (LCU) is a critical area for exploration in current large language models (LLMs). However, due to the inherently lengthy nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses. Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237 test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore, our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See https://github.com/MilkThink-Lab/MiniLongBench for our code, data and tutorial.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly improved long-chain reasoning capabilities over Large Language Models (LLMs). However, LRMs often produce unnecessarily lengthy outputs even for simple queries, leading to inefficiencies or even accuracy degradation compared to LLMs. To overcome this, we propose CP-Router, a training-free and model-agnostic routing framework that dynamically selects between an LLM and an LRM, demonstrated with multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts. The routing decision is guided by the prediction uncertainty estimates derived via Conformal Prediction (CP), which provides rigorous coverage guarantees. To further refine the uncertainty differentiation across inputs, we introduce Full and Binary Entropy (FBE), a novel entropy-based criterion that adaptively selects the appropriate CP threshold. Experiments across diverse MCQA benchmarks, including mathematics, logical reasoning, and Chinese chemistry, demonstrate that CP-Router efficiently reduces token usage while maintaining or even improving accuracy compared to using LRM alone. We also extend CP-Router to diverse model pairings and open-ended QA, where it continues to demonstrate strong performance, validating its generality and robustness.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer an excellent solution for representing the lexical-semantic structures of lexicographic data. However, working with the SPARQL query language represents a considerable hurdle for many non-expert users who could benefit from the advantages of this technology. This paper addresses the challenge of creating natural language interfaces for lexicographic data retrieval on knowledge graphs such as Wikidata. We develop a multidimensional taxonomy capturing the complexity of Wikidata's lexicographic data ontology module through four dimensions and create a template-based dataset with over 1.2 million mappings from natural language utterances to SPARQL queries. Our experiments with GPT-2 (124M), Phi-1.5 (1.3B), and GPT-3.5-Turbo reveal significant differences in model capabilities. While all models perform well on familiar patterns, only GPT-3.5-Turbo demonstrates meaningful generalization capabilities, suggesting that model size and diverse pre-training are crucial for adaptability in this domain. However, significant challenges remain in achieving robust generalization, handling diverse linguistic data, and developing scalable solutions that can accommodate the full complexity of lexicographic knowledge representation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have demonstrated impressive capabilities in single-turn responses, yet multi-turn dialogues remain challenging for even the most sophisticated language models. Current dialogue datasets are limited in their emotional range, domain diversity, turn depth, and are predominantly text-only, hindering progress in developing more human-like conversational systems across modalities. To address these limitations, we present DeepDialogue, a large-scale multimodal dataset containing 40,150 high-quality multi-turn dialogues spanning 41 domains and incorporating 20 distinct emotions with coherent emotional progressions. Our approach pairs 9 different language models (4B-72B parameters) to generate 65,600 initial conversations, which we then evaluate through a combination of human annotation and LLM-based quality filtering. The resulting dataset reveals fundamental insights: smaller models fail to maintain coherence beyond 6 dialogue turns; concrete domains (e.g., "cars," "travel") yield more meaningful conversations than abstract ones (e.g., "philosophy"); and cross-model interactions produce more coherent dialogues than same-model conversations. A key contribution of DeepDialogue is its speech component, where we synthesize emotion-consistent voices for all 40,150 dialogues, creating the first large-scale open-source multimodal dialogue dataset that faithfully preserves emotional context across multi-turn conversations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in general-purpose machine translation, but their effectiveness in complex, domain-sensitive translation tasks remains underexplored. Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), raise the question of whether structured reasoning can enhance translation quality across diverse domains. In this work, we compare the performance of LRMs with traditional LLMs across 15 representative domains and four translation directions. Our evaluation considers various factors, including task difficulty, input length, and terminology density. We use a combination of automatic metrics and an enhanced MQM-based evaluation hierarchy to assess translation quality. Our findings show that LRMs consistently outperform traditional LLMs in semantically complex domains, especially in long-text and high-difficulty translation scenarios. Moreover, domain-adaptive prompting strategies further improve performance by better leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LRMs. These results highlight the potential of structured reasoning in MDMT tasks and provide valuable insights for optimizing translation systems in domain-sensitive contexts.

Abstract: We aim to improve the robustness of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems against non-native speech, particularly in low-resourced multi-accent settings. We introduce Mixture of Accent-Specific LoRAs (MAS-LoRA), a fine-tuning method that leverages a mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, each specialized in a specific accent. This method can be used when the accent is known or unknown at inference time, without the need to fine-tune the model again. Our experiments, conducted using Whisper on the L2-ARCTIC corpus, demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate compared to regular LoRA and full fine-tuning when the accent is unknown. When the accent is known, the results further improve. Furthermore, MAS-LoRA shows less catastrophic forgetting than the other fine-tuning methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of a mixture of LoRA experts for non-native multi-accent ASR.

Abstract: Web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for next-generation AI, but their limited reasoning in uncertain, dynamic web environments hinders robust deployment. In this paper, we identify key reasoning skills essential for effective web agents, i.e., reflection & lookahead, branching, and rollback, and curate trajectory data that exemplifies these abilities by reconstructing the agent's (inference-time) reasoning algorithms into chain-of-thought rationales. We conduct experiments in the agent self-improving benchmark, OpenWebVoyager, and demonstrate that distilling salient reasoning patterns into the backbone LLM via simple fine-tuning can substantially enhance its performance. Our approach yields significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, including WebVoyager, Mind2web-live, and SimpleQA (web search), highlighting the potential of targeted reasoning skill enhancement for web agents.

<title>Does Rationale Quality Matter? Enhancing Mental Disorder Detection via Selective Reasoning Distillation</title>

Abstract: The detection of mental health problems from social media and the interpretation of these results have been extensively explored. Research has shown that incorporating clinical symptom information into a model enhances domain expertise, improving its detection and interpretation performance. While large language models (LLMs) are shown to be effective for generating explanatory rationales in mental health detection, their substantially large parameter size and high computational cost limit their practicality. Reasoning distillation transfers this ability to smaller language models (SLMs), but inconsistencies in the relevance and domain alignment of LLM-generated rationales pose a challenge. This paper investigates how rationale quality impacts SLM performance in mental health detection and explanation generation. We hypothesize that ensuring high-quality and domain-relevant rationales enhances the distillation. To this end, we propose a framework that selects rationales based on their alignment with expert clinical reasoning. Experiments show that our quality-focused approach significantly enhances SLM performance in both mental disorder detection and rationale generation. This work highlights the importance of rationale quality and offers an insightful framework for knowledge transfer in mental health applications.

<title>On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are separated linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Whithin that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are separated by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression.

Abstract: Existing tool-learning methods usually rely on supervised fine-tuning, they often overlook fine-grained optimization of internal tool call details, leading to limitations in preference alignment and error discrimination. To overcome these challenges, we propose Token-level Tool-use Preference Alignment Training Framework (TTPA), a training paradigm for constructing token-level tool-use preference datasets that align LLMs with fine-grained preferences using a novel error-oriented scoring mechanism. TTPA first introduces reversed dataset construction, a method for creating high-quality, multi-turn tool-use datasets by reversing the generation flow. Additionally, we propose Token-level Preference Sampling (TPS) to capture fine-grained preferences by modeling token-level differences during generation. To address biases in scoring, we introduce the Error-oriented Scoring Mechanism (ESM), which quantifies tool-call errors and can be used as a training signal. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTPA significantly improves tool-using performance while showing strong generalization ability across models and datasets.

Abstract: Autonomous agents, which perceive environments and take actions to achieve goals, have become increasingly feasible with the advancements in large language models (LLMs). However, current powerful agents often depend on sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4. Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or suboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent performance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld. For the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected trajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it achieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents trained exclusively on expert trajectories.

<title>Uncertainty-Aware Attention Heads: Efficient Unsupervised Uncertainty Quantification for LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive fluency, but often produce critical errors known as "hallucinations". Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods are a promising tool for coping with this fundamental shortcoming. Yet, existing UQ methods face challenges such as high computational overhead or reliance on supervised learning. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we propose RAUQ (Recurrent Attention-based Uncertainty Quantification), an unsupervised approach that leverages intrinsic attention patterns in transformers to detect hallucinations efficiently. By analyzing attention weights, we identified a peculiar pattern: drops in attention to preceding tokens are systematically observed during incorrect generations for certain "uncertainty-aware" heads. RAUQ automatically selects such heads, recurrently aggregates their attention weights and token-level confidences, and computes sequence-level uncertainty scores in a single forward pass. Experiments across 4 LLMs and 12 question answering, summarization, and translation tasks demonstrate that RAUQ yields excellent results, outperforming state-of-the-art UQ methods using minimal computational overhead (<1% latency). Moreover, it requires no task-specific labels and no careful hyperparameter tuning, offering plug-and-play real-time hallucination detection in white-box LLMs.

arXiv:2505.20047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable promise for democratizing automated reasoning by generating formal specifications. However, a fundamental tension exists: LLMs are probabilistic, while formal verification demands deterministic guarantees. This paper addresses this epistemological gap by comprehensively investigating failure modes and uncertainty quantification (UQ) in LLM-generated formal artifacts. Our systematic evaluation of five frontier LLMs reveals Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based autoformalization's domain-specific impact on accuracy (from +34.8% on logical tasks to -44.5% on factual ones), with known UQ techniques like the entropy of token probabilities failing to identify these errors. We introduce a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) framework to model LLM outputs, yielding a refined uncertainty taxonomy. We find uncertainty signals are task-dependent (e.g., grammar entropy for logic, AUROC>0.93). Finally, a lightweight fusion of these signals enables selective verification, drastically reducing errors (14-100%) with minimal abstention, transforming LLM-driven formalization into a reliable engineering discipline.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning-intensive tasks, but enhancing their reasoning abilities typically relies on either reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable signals or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) demonstrations, both of which are expensive. In this paper, we study a novel problem of incentivizing the reasoning capacity of LLMs without expensive high-quality demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We investigate whether the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively incentivized via supervision from significantly weaker models. We further analyze when and why such weak supervision succeeds in eliciting reasoning abilities in stronger models. Our findings show that supervision from significantly weaker reasoners can substantially improve student reasoning performance, recovering close to 94% of the gains of expensive RL at a fraction of the cost. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that weak reasoners can effectively incentivize reasoning in stronger student models, consistently improving performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Our results suggest that this simple weak-to-strong paradigm is a promising and generalizable alternative to costly methods for incentivizing strong reasoning capabilities at inference-time in LLMs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyige/W2SR.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space. However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space. Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on MATH. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyige/SEA

Abstract: Preference mechanisms, such as human preference, LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ), and reward models, are central to aligning and evaluating large language models (LLMs). Yet, the underlying concepts that drive these preferences remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose a fully automated end-to-end method for generating local and global concept-based explanations of preferences across multiple domains. Our method employs an LLM to discover concepts that differentiate between chosen and rejected responses and represent them with concept-based vectors. To model the relationships between concepts and preferences, we propose a white-box Hierarchical Multi-Domain Regression model that captures both domain-general and domain-specific effects. To evaluate our method, we curate a dataset spanning eight challenging and diverse domains and explain twelve mechanisms. Our method achieves strong preference prediction performance, outperforming baselines while also being explainable. Additionally, we assess explanations in two novel application-driven settings. First, guiding LLM outputs with concepts from LaaJ explanations yields responses that those judges consistently prefer. Second, prompting LaaJs with concepts explaining humans improves their preference predictions. Together, our work provides a new paradigm for explainability in the era of LLMs.

Abstract: We present MA-RAG, a Multi-Agent framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that addresses the inherent ambiguities and reasoning challenges in complex information-seeking tasks. Unlike conventional RAG methods that rely on either end-to-end fine-tuning or isolated component enhancements, MA-RAG orchestrates a collaborative set of specialized AI agents: Planner, Step Definer, Extractor, and QA Agents, to tackle each stage of the RAG pipeline with task-aware reasoning. Ambiguities may arise from underspecified queries, sparse or indirect evidence in retrieved documents, or the need to integrate information scattered across multiple sources. MA-RAG mitigates these challenges by decomposing the problem into subtasks, such as query disambiguation, evidence extraction, and answer synthesis, and dispatching them to dedicated agents equipped with chain-of-thought prompting. These agents communicate intermediate reasoning and progressively refine the retrieval and synthesis process. Our design allows fine-grained control over information flow without any model fine-tuning. Crucially, agents are invoked on demand, enabling a dynamic and efficient workflow that avoids unnecessary computation. This modular and reasoning-driven architecture enables MA-RAG to deliver robust, interpretable results. Experiments on multi-hop and ambiguous QA benchmarks demonstrate that MA-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines and rivals fine-tuned systems, validating the effectiveness of collaborative agent-based reasoning in RAG.

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) is often sensitive to nuances in prompt templates, requiring careful prompt engineering, adding costs in terms of computing and human effort. In this study, we present experiments encompassing multiple LLMs variants of varying sizes aimed at probing their preference with different prompts. Through experiments on Question Answering, we show prompt preference consistency across LLMs of different sizes. We also show that this consistency extends to other tasks, such as Natural Language Inference. Utilizing this consistency, we propose a method to use a smaller model to select effective prompt templates for a larger model. We show that our method substantially reduces the cost of prompt engineering while consistently matching performance with optimal prompts among candidates. More importantly, our experiment shows the efficacy of our strategy across fourteen LLMs and its applicability to a broad range of NLP tasks, highlighting its robustness

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on question-answering (QA) tasks because of their superior capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, LLM-based QA struggles with complex QA tasks due to poor reasoning capacity, outdated knowledge, and hallucinations. Several recent works synthesize LLMs and knowledge graphs (KGs) for QA to address the above challenges. In this survey, we propose a new structured taxonomy that categorizes the methodology of synthesizing LLMs and KGs for QA according to the categories of QA and the KG's role when integrating with LLMs. We systematically survey state-of-the-art advances in synthesizing LLMs and KGs for QA and compare and analyze these approaches in terms of strength, limitations, and KG requirements. We then align the approaches with QA and discuss how these approaches address the main challenges of different complex QA. Finally, we summarize the advancements, evaluation metrics, and benchmark datasets and highlight open challenges and opportunities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in handling complex tasks through long-chain reasoning. However, the extensive reasoning steps involved can significantly increase computational costs, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Recent efforts have focused on optimizing reasoning efficiency by shortening the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning processes through various approaches, such as length-aware prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning on CoT data with variable lengths, and reinforcement learning with length penalties. Although these methods effectively reduce reasoning length, they still necessitate an initial reasoning phase. More recent approaches have attempted to integrate long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities into a single model, yet they still rely on manual control to toggle between short and long CoT.In this work, we propose a novel approach that autonomously switches between short and long reasoning chains based on problem complexity. Our method begins with supervised fine-tuning of the base model to equip both long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities. We then employ reinforcement learning to further balance short and long CoT generation while maintaining accuracy through two key strategies: first, integrating reinforcement learning with a long-short adaptive group-wise reward strategy to assess prompt complexity and provide corresponding rewards; second, implementing a logit-based reasoning mode switching loss to optimize the model's initial token choice, thereby guiding the selection of the reasoning type.Evaluations on mathematical datasets demonstrate that our model can dynamically switch between long-chain and short-chain reasoning modes without substantially sacrificing performance. This advancement enhances the practicality of reasoning in large language models for real-world applications.

Abstract: Suicidal risk detection in adolescents is a critical challenge, yet existing methods rely on language-specific models, limiting scalability and generalization. This study introduces a novel language-agnostic framework for suicidal risk assessment with large language models (LLMs). We generate Chinese transcripts from speech using an ASR model and then employ LLMs with prompt-based queries to extract suicidal risk-related features from these transcripts. The extracted features are retained in both Chinese and English to enable cross-linguistic analysis and then used to fine-tune corresponding pretrained language models independently. Experimental results show that our method achieves performance comparable to direct fine-tuning with ASR results or to models trained solely on Chinese suicidal risk-related features, demonstrating its potential to overcome language constraints and improve the robustness of suicidal risk assessment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of downstream natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, their considerable sizes and memory demands hinder practical deployment, underscoring the importance of developing efficient compression strategies. Singular value decomposition (SVD) decomposes a matrix into orthogonal components, enabling efficient low-rank approximation. This is particularly suitable for LLM compression, where weight matrices often exhibit significant redundancy. However, current SVD-based methods neglect the residual matrix from truncation, resulting in significant truncation loss. Additionally, compressing all layers of the model results in severe performance degradation. To overcome these limitations, we propose ResSVD, a new post-training SVD-based LLM compression method. Specifically, we leverage the residual matrix generated during the truncation process to reduce truncation loss. Moreover, under a fixed overall compression ratio, we selectively compress the last few layers of the model, which mitigates error propagation and significantly improves the performance of compressed models.Comprehensive evaluations of ResSVD on diverse LLM families and multiple benchmark datasets indicate that ResSVD consistently achieves superior performance over existing counterpart methods, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.

arXiv:2505.20113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased digitization of world's textual heritage poses significant challenges for both computer science and literary studies. Overall, there is an urgent need of computational techniques able to adapt to the challenges of historical texts, such as orthographic and spelling variations, fragmentary structure and digitization errors. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, suggesting promising applications for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on historical documents. In spite of this, no thorough evaluation has been proposed for Italian texts. This research tries to fill the gap by proposing a new challenging dataset for entity extraction based on a corpus of 19th century scholarly notes, i.e. Giacomo Leopardi's Zibaldone (1898), containing 2,899 references to people, locations and literary works. This dataset was used to carry out reproducible experiments with both domain-specific BERT-based models and state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLaMa3.1. Results show that instruction-tuned models encounter multiple difficulties handling historical humanistic texts, while fine-tuned NER models offer more robust performance even with challenging entity types such as bibliographic references.

arXiv:2505.20118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into sensitive workflows, concerns grow over their potential to leak confidential information. We propose TrojanStego, a novel threat model in which an adversary fine-tunes an LLM to embed sensitive context information into natural-looking outputs via linguistic steganography, without requiring explicit control over inference inputs. We introduce a taxonomy outlining risk factors for compromised LLMs, and use it to evaluate the risk profile of the threat. To implement TrojanStego, we propose a practical encoding scheme based on vocabulary partitioning learnable by LLMs via fine-tuning. Experimental results show that compromised models reliably transmit 32-bit secrets with 87% accuracy on held-out prompts, reaching over 97% accuracy using majority voting across three generations. Further, they maintain high utility, can evade human detection, and preserve coherence. These results highlight a new class of LLM data exfiltration attacks that are passive, covert, practical, and dangerous.

<title>Iterative Self-Incentivization Empowers Large Language Models as Agentic Searchers</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into information retrieval to advance traditional techniques. However, effectively enabling LLMs to seek accurate knowledge in complex tasks remains a challenge due to the complexity of multi-hop queries as well as the irrelevant retrieved content. To address these limitations, we propose EXSEARCH, an agentic search framework, where the LLM learns to retrieve useful information as the reasoning unfolds through a self-incentivized process. At each step, the LLM decides what to retrieve (thinking), triggers an external retriever (search), and extracts fine-grained evidence (recording) to support next-step reasoning. To enable LLM with this capability, EXSEARCH adopts a Generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In the E-step, the LLM generates multiple search trajectories and assigns an importance weight to each; the M-step trains the LLM on them with a re-weighted loss function. This creates a self-incentivized loop, where the LLM iteratively learns from its own generated data, progressively improving itself for search. We further theoretically analyze this training process, establishing convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that EXSEARCH substantially outperforms baselines, e.g., +7.8% improvement on exact match score. Motivated by these promising results, we introduce EXSEARCH-Zoo, an extension that extends our method to broader scenarios, to facilitate future work.

arXiv:2505.20133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current language models rely on static vocabularies determined at pretraining time, which can lead to decreased performance and increased computational cost for domains underrepresented in the original vocabulary. New tokens can be added to solve this problem, when coupled with a good initialization for their new embeddings. However, existing embedding initialization methods either require expensive further training or pretraining of additional modules. In this paper, we propose AweDist and show that by distilling representations obtained using the original tokenization, we can quickly learn high-quality input embeddings for new tokens. Experimental results with a wide range of open-weight models show that AweDist is able to outperform even strong baselines.

arXiv:2505.20144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of Language Models (LMs) across diverse tasks, no single model consistently outperforms others, necessitating efficient methods to combine their strengths without expensive retraining. Existing model merging techniques, such as parameter averaging and task-guided fusion, often rely on data-dependent computations or fail to preserve internal knowledge, limiting their robustness and scalability. We introduce SeMe (Semantic-based Merging), a novel, data-free, and training-free approach that leverages latent semantic alignment to merge LMs at a fine-grained, layer-wise level. Unlike prior work, SeMe not only preserves model behaviors but also explicitly stabilizes internal knowledge, addressing a critical gap in LM fusion. Through extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks, we demonstrate that SeMe outperforms existing methods in both performance and efficiency while eliminating reliance on external data. Our work establishes a new paradigm for knowledge-aware model merging and provides insights into the semantic structure of LMs, paving the way for more scalable and interpretable model composition.

arXiv:2505.20154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Uniform Orthogonal Reinitialization Adaptation (UORA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach for Large Language Models (LLMs). UORA achieves state-of-the-art performance and parameter efficiency by leveraging a low-rank approximation method to reduce the number of trainable parameters. Unlike existing methods such as LoRA and VeRA, UORA employs an interpolation-based reparametrization mechanism that selectively reinitializes rows and columns in frozen projection matrices, guided by the vector magnitude heuristic. This results in substantially fewer trainable parameters compared to LoRA and outperforms VeRA in computation and storage efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate UORA's superiority in achieving competitive fine-tuning performance with negligible computational overhead. We demonstrate its performance on GLUE and E2E benchmarks and its effectiveness in instruction-tuning large language models and image classification models. Our contributions establish a new paradigm for scalable and resource-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs.

<title>Pangu Light: Weight Re-Initialization for Pruning and Accelerating LLMs</title>

arXiv:2505.20155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art capabilities across numerous tasks, but their immense size and inference costs pose significant computational challenges for practical deployment. While structured pruning offers a promising avenue for model compression, existing methods often struggle with the detrimental effects of aggressive, simultaneous width and depth reductions, leading to substantial performance degradation. This paper argues that a critical, often overlooked, aspect in making such aggressive joint pruning viable is the strategic re-initialization and adjustment of remaining weights to improve the model post-pruning training accuracies. We introduce Pangu Light, a framework for LLM acceleration centered around structured pruning coupled with novel weight re-initialization techniques designed to address this ``missing piece''. Our framework systematically targets multiple axes, including model width, depth, attention heads, and RMSNorm, with its effectiveness rooted in novel re-initialization methods like Cross-Layer Attention Pruning (CLAP) and Stabilized LayerNorm Pruning (SLNP) that mitigate performance drops by providing the network a better training starting point. Further enhancing efficiency, Pangu Light incorporates specialized optimizations such as absorbing Post-RMSNorm computations and tailors its strategies to Ascend NPU characteristics. The Pangu Light models consistently exhibit a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, outperforming prominent baseline pruning methods like Nemotron and established LLMs like Qwen3 series. For instance, on Ascend NPUs, Pangu Light-32B's 81.6 average score and 2585 tokens/s throughput exceed Qwen3-32B's 80.9 average score and 2225 tokens/s.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines, accurately transcribing dysarthric speech remains a major challenge. In this work, we proposed a two-stage framework for the Speech Accessibility Project Challenge at INTERSPEECH 2025, which combines cutting-edge speech recognition models with LLM-based generative error correction (GER). We assess different configurations of model scales and training strategies, incorporating specific hypothesis selection to improve transcription accuracy. Experiments on the Speech Accessibility Project dataset demonstrate the strength of our approach on structured and spontaneous speech, while highlighting challenges in single-word recognition. Through comprehensive analysis, we provide insights into the complementary roles of acoustic and linguistic modeling in dysarthric speech recognition

Abstract: Images usually convey richer detail than text, but often include redundant information which potentially downgrades multimodal reasoning performance. When faced with lengthy or complex messages, humans tend to employ abstract thinking to convert them into simple and concise abstracts. Inspired by this cognitive strategy, we introduce Visual Abstract Thinking (VAT), a novel thinking paradigm that prompts Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual abstract instead of explicit verbal thoughts or elaborate guidance, permitting a more concentrated visual reasoning mechanism. Explicit thinking, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT) or tool-augmented approaches, increases the complexity of reasoning process via inserting verbose intermediate steps, external knowledge or visual information. In contrast, VAT reduces redundant visual information and encourages models to focus their reasoning on more essential visual elements. Experimental results show that VAT consistently empowers different models, and achieves an average gain of 17% over GPT-4o baseline by employing diverse types of visual abstracts, demonstrating that VAT can enhance visual reasoning abilities for MLLMs regarding conceptual, structural and relational reasoning tasks. VAT is also compatible with CoT in knowledge-intensive multimodal reasoning tasks. These findings highlight the effectiveness of visual reasoning via abstract thinking and encourage further exploration of more diverse reasoning paradigms from the perspective of human cognition.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional neural architectures, yet their application to speech processing remains under explored. This work presents the first investigation of KANs for Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) tasks. We experiment with 2D-CNN models on two datasets, integrating KAN layers in five different configurations within the dense block. The best-performing setup, which places a KAN layer between two linear layers, is directly applied to transformer-based models and evaluated on five SLU datasets with increasing complexity. Our results show that KAN layers can effectively replace the linear layers, achieving comparable or superior performance in most cases. Finally, we provide insights into how KAN and linear layers on top of transformers differently attend to input regions of the raw waveforms.

Abstract: Assessing higher-order thinking skills in large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, especially in tasks that go beyond surface-level accuracy. In this work, we propose THiNK (Testing Higher-order Notion of Knowledge), a multi-agent, feedback-driven evaluation framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. THiNK frames reasoning assessment as an iterative task of problem generation, critique, and revision, encouraging LLMs to think-aloud through step-by-step reflection and refinement. This enables a systematic evaluation of both lower-order (e.g., remember, understand) and higher-order (e.g., evaluate, create) thinking skills. We apply THiNK to seven state-of-the-art LLMs and perform a detailed cognitive analysis of their outputs. Results reveal that while models reliably perform lower-order categories well, they struggle with applying knowledge in realistic contexts and exhibit limited abstraction. Structured feedback loops significantly improve reasoning performance, particularly in higher-order thinking. Qualitative evaluations further confirm that THiNK-guided outputs better align with domain logic and problem structure. The code of our framework provides a scalable methodology for probing and enhancing LLM reasoning, offering new directions for evaluation grounded in learning science, which is available at our GitHub repository.

arXiv:2505.20195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the quality of long-form, model-generated text is challenging, even with advanced LLM-as-a-Judge methods, due to performance degradation as input length increases. To address this issue, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach, which breaks down the comprehensive evaluation task into a series of localized scoring tasks, followed by a final global assessment. This strategy allows for more granular and manageable evaluations, ensuring that each segment of the text is assessed in isolation for both coherence and quality, while also accounting for the overall structure and consistency of the entire piece. Moreover, we introduce a hybrid in-context learning approach that leverages human annotations to enhance the performance of both local and global evaluations. By incorporating human-generated feedback directly into the evaluation process, this method allows the model to better align with human judgment. Finally, we develop an uncertainty-based active learning algorithm that efficiently selects data samples for human annotation, thereby reducing annotation costs in practical scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed evaluation framework outperforms several representative baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances controllability in generative models by interpolating conditional and unconditional predictions. However, standard CFG often employs a static unconditional input, which can be suboptimal for iterative generation processes where model uncertainty varies dynamically. We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel method that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's instantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked) diffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated sequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are temporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This focuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to more effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked diffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse language generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements over standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work highlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model uncertainty in iterative generation.

Abstract: Limited access to mental healthcare, extended wait times, and increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led individuals to turn to LLMs for fulfilling their mental health needs. However, examining the multi-turn mental health conversation capabilities of LLMs remains under-explored. Existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on diagnostic accuracy and win-rates and often overlook alignment with patient-specific goals, values, and personalities required for meaningful conversations. To address this, we introduce MedAgent, a novel framework for synthetically generating realistic, multi-turn mental health sensemaking conversations and use it to create the Mental Health Sensemaking Dialogue (MHSD) dataset, comprising over 2,200 patient-LLM conversations. Additionally, we present MultiSenseEval, a holistic framework to evaluate the multi-turn conversation abilities of LLMs in healthcare settings using human-centric criteria. Our findings reveal that frontier reasoning models yield below-par performance for patient-centric communication and struggle at advanced diagnostic capabilities with average score of 31%. Additionally, we observed variation in model performance based on patient's persona and performance drop with increasing turns in the conversation. Our work provides a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework, a dataset and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in multi-turn mental health conversations.

<title>How to Improve the Robustness of Closed-Source Models on NLI</title>

Abstract: Closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular, with impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. These models can be fine-tuned to further improve performance, but this often results in the models learning from dataset-specific heuristics that reduce their robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methods to improve robustness either perform poorly, or are non-applicable to closed-source models because they assume access to model internals, or the ability to change the model's training procedure. In this work, we investigate strategies to improve the robustness of closed-source LLMs through data-centric methods that do not require access to model internals. We find that the optimal strategy depends on the complexity of the OOD data. For highly complex OOD datasets, upsampling more challenging training examples can improve robustness by up to 1.5%. For less complex OOD datasets, replacing a portion of the training set with LLM-generated examples can improve robustness by 3.7%. More broadly, we find that large-scale closed-source autoregressive LLMs are substantially more robust than commonly used encoder models, and are a more appropriate choice of baseline going forward.

<title>Dependency Parsing is More Parameter-Efficient with Normalization</title>

Abstract: Dependency parsing is the task of inferring natural language structure, often approached by modeling word interactions via attention through biaffine scoring. This mechanism works like self-attention in Transformers, where scores are calculated for every pair of words in a sentence. However, unlike Transformer attention, biaffine scoring does not use normalization prior to taking the softmax of the scores. In this paper, we provide theoretical evidence and empirical results revealing that a lack of normalization necessarily results in overparameterized parser models, where the extra parameters compensate for the sharp softmax outputs produced by high variance inputs to the biaffine scoring function. We argue that biaffine scoring can be made substantially more efficient by performing score normalization. We conduct experiments on six datasets for semantic and syntactic dependency parsing using a one-hop parser. We train N-layer stacked BiLSTMs and evaluate the parser's performance with and without normalizing biaffine scores. Normalizing allows us to beat the state of the art on two datasets, with fewer samples and trainable parameters. Code: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EfficientSDP-70C1

<title>FLAME-MoE: A Transparent End-to-End Research Platform for Mixture-of-Experts Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent large language models such as Gemini-1.5, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-4 increasingly adopt Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, which offer strong efficiency-performance trade-offs by activating only a fraction of the model per token. Yet academic researchers still lack a fully open, end-to-end MoE platform for investigating scaling, routing, and expert behavior. We release FLAME-MoE, a completely open-source research suite composed of seven decoder-only models, ranging from 38M to 1.7B active parameters, whose architecture--64 experts with top-8 gating and 2 shared experts--closely reflects modern production LLMs. All training data pipelines, scripts, logs, and checkpoints are publicly available to enable reproducible experimentation. Across six evaluation tasks, FLAME-MoE improves average accuracy by up to 3.4 points over dense baselines trained with identical FLOPs. Leveraging full training trace transparency, we present initial analyses showing that (i) experts increasingly specialize on distinct token subsets, (ii) co-activation matrices remain sparse, reflecting diverse expert usage, and (iii) routing behavior stabilizes early in training. All code, training logs, and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/cmu-flame/FLAME-MoE.

<title>Bridging the Long-Term Gap: A Memory-Active Policy for Multi-Session Task-Oriented Dialogue</title>

Abstract: Existing Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems primarily focus on single-session dialogues, limiting their effectiveness in long-term memory augmentation. To address this challenge, we introduce a MS-TOD dataset, the first multi-session TOD dataset designed to retain long-term memory across sessions, enabling fewer turns and more efficient task completion. This defines a new benchmark task for evaluating long-term memory in multi-session TOD. Based on this new dataset, we propose a Memory-Active Policy (MAP) that improves multi-session dialogue efficiency through a two-stage approach. 1) Memory-Guided Dialogue Planning retrieves intent-aligned history, identifies key QA units via a memory judger, refines them by removing redundant questions, and generates responses based on the reconstructed memory. 2) Proactive Response Strategy detects and correct errors or omissions, ensuring efficient and accurate task completion. We evaluate MAP on MS-TOD dataset, focusing on response quality and effectiveness of the proactive strategy. Experiments on MS-TOD demonstrate that MAP significantly improves task success and turn efficiency in multi-session scenarios, while maintaining competitive performance on conventional single-session tasks.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large audio-language models for speech translation remains challenging due to their significant computational requirements. In this paper, we address this challenge through our system submissions to the "Model Compression" track at the International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2025). We experiment with a combination of approaches including iterative layer pruning based on layer importance evaluation, low-rank adaptation with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA), and knowledge distillation. In our experiments, we use Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct for speech translation into German and Chinese. Our pruned (student) models achieve up to a 50% reduction in both model parameters and storage footprint, while retaining 97-100% of the translation quality of the in-domain (teacher) models.

Abstract: Time plays a critical role in how information is generated, retrieved, and interpreted. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Temporal Information Retrieval and Temporal Question Answering, two research areas aimed at handling and understanding time-sensitive information. As the amount of time-stamped content from sources like news articles, web archives, and knowledge bases increases, systems must address challenges such as detecting temporal intent, normalizing time expressions, ordering events, and reasoning over evolving or ambiguous facts. These challenges are critical across many dynamic and time-sensitive domains, from news and encyclopedias to science, history, and social media. We review both traditional approaches and modern neural methods, including those that use transformer models and Large Language Models (LLMs). We also review recent advances in temporal language modeling, multi-hop reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), alongside benchmark datasets and evaluation strategies that test temporal robustness, recency awareness, and generalization.

<title>KnowTrace: Bootstrapping Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Structured Knowledge Tracing</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) furnish large language models (LLMs) with iterative retrievals of relevant information to handle complex multi-hop questions. These methods typically alternate between LLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's context. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing burden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces, with futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this paper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the context overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead of simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out desired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to the input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with an intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective mechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as process supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show that KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop question answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies the gains.

Abstract: Climate change adaptation requires the understanding of disruptive weather impacts on society, where large language models (LLMs) might be applicable. However, their effectiveness is under-explored due to the difficulty of high-quality corpus collection and the lack of available benchmarks. The climate-related events stored in regional newspapers record how communities adapted and recovered from disasters. However, the processing of the original corpus is non-trivial. In this study, we first develop a disruptive weather impact dataset with a four-stage well-crafted construction pipeline. Then, we propose WXImpactBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the capacity of LLMs on disruptive weather impacts. The benchmark involves two evaluation tasks, multi-label classification and ranking-based question answering. Extensive experiments on evaluating a set of LLMs provide first-hand analysis of the challenges in developing disruptive weather impact understanding and climate change adaptation systems. The constructed dataset and the code for the evaluation framework are available to help society protect against vulnerabilities from disasters.

<title>ARM: Adaptive Reasoning Model</title>

Abstract: While large reasoning models demonstrate strong performance on complex tasks, they lack the ability to adjust reasoning token usage based on task difficulty. This often leads to the "overthinking" problem -- excessive and unnecessary reasoning -- which, although potentially mitigated by human intervention to control the token budget, still fundamentally contradicts the goal of achieving fully autonomous AI. In this work, we propose Adaptive Reasoning Model (ARM), a reasoning model capable of adaptively selecting appropriate reasoning formats based on the task at hand. These formats include three efficient ones -- Direct Answer, Short CoT, and Code -- as well as a more elaborate format, Long CoT. To train ARM, we introduce Ada-GRPO, an adaptation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which addresses the format collapse issue in traditional GRPO. Ada-GRPO enables ARM to achieve high token efficiency, reducing tokens by an average of 30%, and up to 70%, while maintaining performance comparable to the model that relies solely on Long CoT. Furthermore, not only does it improve inference efficiency through reduced token generation, but it also brings a 2x speedup in training. In addition to the default Adaptive Mode, ARM supports two additional reasoning modes: 1) Instruction-Guided Mode, which allows users to explicitly specify the reasoning format via special tokens -- ideal when the appropriate format is known for a batch of tasks. 2) Consensus-Guided Mode, which aggregates the outputs of the three efficient formats and resorts to Long CoT in case of disagreement, prioritizing performance with higher token usage.

<title>Does quantization affect models' performance on long-context tasks?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows exceeding 128K tokens, but this comes with significant memory requirements and high inference latency. Quantization can mitigate these costs, but may degrade performance. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of quantized LLMs on tasks with long-inputs (>64K tokens) and long-form outputs. Our evaluation spans 9.7K test examples, five quantization methods (FP8, GPTQ-int8, AWQ-int4, GPTQ-int4, BNB-nf4), and five models (Llama-3.1 8B and 70B; Qwen-2.5 7B, 32B, and 72B). We find that, on average, 8-bit quantization preserves accuracy (~0.8% drop), whereas 4-bit methods lead to substantial losses, especially for tasks involving long context inputs (drops of up to 59%). This degradation tends to worsen when the input is in a language other than English. Crucially, the effects of quantization depend heavily on the quantization method, model, and task. For instance, while Qwen-2.5 72B remains robust under BNB-nf4, Llama-3.1 70B experiences a 32% performance drop on the same task. These findings highlight the importance of a careful, task-specific evaluation before deploying quantized LLMs, particularly in long-context scenarios and with languages other than English.

<title>OmniCharacter: Towards Immersive Role-Playing Agents with Seamless Speech-Language Personality Interaction</title>

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), benefiting from large language models, is an emerging interactive AI system that simulates roles or characters with diverse personalities. However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/OmniCharacter.

<title>MASKSEARCH: A Universal Pre-Training Framework to Enhance Agentic Search Capability</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20285</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) represent a classic paradigm where models enhance generative capabilities using external knowledge retrieved via a specialized module. Recent advancements in Agent techniques enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously utilize tools for retrieval, planning, and reasoning. While existing training-based methods show promise, their agentic abilities are limited by inherent characteristics of the task-specific data used during training. To further enhance the universal search capability of agents, we propose a novel pre-training framework, MASKSEARCH. In the pre-training stage, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Mask Prediction (RAMP) task, where the model learns to leverage search tools to fill masked spans on a large number of pre-training data, thus acquiring universal retrieval and reasoning capabilities for LLMs. After that, the model is trained on downstream tasks to achieve further improvement. We apply both Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training. For SFT, we combine agent-based and distillation-based methods to generate training data, starting with a multi-agent system consisting of a planner, rewriter, observer, and followed by a self-evolving teacher model. While for RL, we employ DAPO as the training framework and adopt a hybrid reward system consisting of answer rewards and format rewards. Additionally, we introduce a curriculum learning approach that allows the model to learn progressively from easier to more challenging instances based on the number of masked spans. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in the scenario of open-domain multi-hop question answering. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MASKSEARCH significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based search agents on both in-domain and out-of-domain downstream tasks.

<title>Enhancing the Comprehensibility of Text Explanations via Unsupervised Concept Discovery</title>

Abstract: Concept-based explainable approaches have emerged as a promising method in explainable AI because they can interpret models in a way that aligns with human reasoning. However, their adaption in the text domain remains limited. Most existing methods rely on predefined concept annotations and cannot discover unseen concepts, while other methods that extract concepts without supervision often produce explanations that are not intuitively comprehensible to humans, potentially diminishing user trust. These methods fall short of discovering comprehensible concepts automatically. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{ECO-Concept}, an intrinsically interpretable framework to discover comprehensible concepts with no concept annotations. ECO-Concept first utilizes an object-centric architecture to extract semantic concepts automatically. Then the comprehensibility of the extracted concepts is evaluated by large language models. Finally, the evaluation result guides the subsequent model fine-tuning to obtain more understandable explanations. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across diverse tasks. Further concept evaluations validate that the concepts learned by ECO-Concept surpassed current counterparts in comprehensibility.

<title>Self-reflective Uncertainties: Do LLMs Know Their Internal Answer Distribution?</title>

Abstract: To reveal when a large language model (LLM) is uncertain about a response, uncertainty quantification commonly produces percentage numbers along with the output. But is this all we can do? We argue that in the output space of LLMs, the space of strings, exist strings expressive enough to summarize the distribution over output strings the LLM deems possible. We lay a foundation for this new avenue of uncertainty explication and present SelfReflect, a theoretically-motivated metric to assess how faithfully a string summarizes an LLM's internal answer distribution. We show that SelfReflect is able to discriminate even subtle differences of candidate summary strings and that it aligns with human judgement, outperforming alternative metrics such as LLM judges and embedding comparisons. With SelfReflect, we investigate a number of self-summarization methods and find that even state-of-the-art reasoning models struggle to explicate their internal uncertainty. But we find that faithful summarizations can be generated by sampling and summarizing. Our metric enables future works towards this universal form of LLM uncertainties.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities through test-time computation (TTC) techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting and tree-based reasoning. However, we argue that current reasoning LLMs (RLLMs) lack the ability to systematically explore the solution space. This paper formalizes what constitutes systematic problem solving and identifies common failure modes that reveal reasoning LLMs to be wanderers rather than systematic explorers. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, we uncover persistent issues: invalid reasoning steps, redundant explorations, hallucinated or unfaithful conclusions, and so on. Our findings suggest that current models' performance can appear to be competent on simple tasks yet degrade sharply as complexity increases. Based on the findings, we advocate for new metrics and tools that evaluate not just final outputs but the structure of the reasoning process itself.

Abstract: Manga, or Japanese comics, is a richly multimodal narrative form that blends images and text in complex ways. Teaching large multimodal models (LMMs) to understand such narratives at a human-like level could help manga creators reflect on and refine their stories. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks for multimodal manga understanding: MangaOCR, which targets in-page text recognition, and MangaVQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding through visual question answering. MangaVQA consists of 526 high-quality, manually constructed question-answer pairs, enabling reliable evaluation across diverse narrative and visual scenarios. Building on these benchmarks, we develop MangaLMM, a manga-specialized model finetuned from the open-source LMM Qwen2.5-VL to jointly handle both tasks. Through extensive experiments, including comparisons with proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5, we assess how well LMMs understand manga. Our benchmark and model provide a comprehensive foundation for evaluating and advancing LMMs in the richly narrative domain of manga.

Abstract: Low Rank Decomposition (LRD) is a model compression technique applied to the weight tensors of deep learning models in order to reduce the number of trainable parameters and computational complexity. However, due to high number of new layers added to the architecture after applying LRD, it may not lead to a high training/inference acceleration if the decomposition ranks are not small enough. The issue is that using small ranks increases the risk of significant accuracy drop after decomposition. In this paper, we propose two techniques for accelerating low rank decomposed models without requiring to use small ranks for decomposition. These methods include rank optimization and sequential freezing of decomposed layers. We perform experiments on both convolutional and transformer-based models. Experiments show that these techniques can improve the model throughput up to 60% during training and 37% during inference when combined together while preserving the accuracy close to that of the original models

Abstract: This paper presents our proposed approach that won the first prize at the ICLR competition on Hardware Aware Efficient Training. The challenge is to achieve the highest possible accuracy in an image classification task in less than 10 minutes. The training is done on a small dataset of 5000 images picked randomly from CIFAR-10 dataset. The evaluation is performed by the competition organizers on a secret dataset with 1000 images of the same size. Our approach includes applying a series of technique for improving the generalization of ResNet-9 including: sharpness aware optimization, label smoothing, gradient centralization, input patch whitening as well as metalearning based training. Our experiments show that the ResNet-9 can achieve the accuracy of 88% while trained only on a 10% subset of CIFAR-10 dataset in less than 10 minuets

Abstract: Massive transformer-based models face several challenges, including slow and computationally intensive pre-training and over-parametrization. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a versatile method called GQKVA, which generalizes query, key, and value grouping techniques. GQKVA is designed to speed up transformer pre-training while reducing the model size. Our experiments with various GQKVA variants highlight a clear trade-off between performance and model size, allowing for customized choices based on resource and time limitations. Our findings also indicate that the conventional multi-head attention approach is not always the best choice, as there are lighter and faster alternatives available. We tested our method on ViT, which achieved an approximate 0.3% increase in accuracy while reducing the model size by about 4% in the task of image classification. Additionally, our most aggressive model reduction experiment resulted in a reduction of approximately 15% in model size, with only around a 1% drop in accuracy.

Abstract: Rapidly growing numbers of multilingual news consumers pose an increasing challenge to news recommender systems in terms of providing customized recommendations. First, existing neural news recommenders, even when powered by multilingual language models (LMs), suffer substantial performance losses in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (ZS-XLT). Second, the current paradigm of fine-tuning the backbone LM of a neural recommender on task-specific data is computationally expensive and infeasible in few-shot recommendation and cold-start setups, where data is scarce or completely unavailable. In this work, we propose a news-adapted sentence encoder (NaSE), domain-specialized from a pretrained massively multilingual sentence encoder (SE). To this end, we construct and leverage PolyNews and PolyNewsParallel, two multilingual news-specific corpora. With the news-adapted multilingual SE in place, we test the effectiveness of (i.e., question the need for) supervised fine-tuning for news recommendation, and propose a simple and strong baseline based on (i) frozen NaSE embeddings and (ii) late click-behavior fusion. We show that NaSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-XLT in true cold-start and few-shot news recommendation.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a mathematically supported technique for data compression. It consists of applying some kind of a Low Rank Decomposition technique on the tensors or matrices in order to reduce the redundancy of the data. However, it is not a popular technique for compressing the AI models duo to the high number of new layers added to the architecture after decomposition. Although the number of parameters could shrink significantly, it could result in the model be more than twice deeper which could add some latency to the training or inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities, but often suffer from hallucinations or outdated knowledge. Knowledge Graph (KG)-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remedies these shortcomings by grounding LLM responses in structured external information from a knowledge base. However, many KG-based RAG approaches struggle with (i) aligning KG and textual representations, (ii) balancing retrieval accuracy and efficiency, and (iii) adapting to dynamically updated KGs. In this work, we introduce Walk&amp;Retrieve, a simple yet effective KG-based framework that leverages walk-based graph traversal and knowledge verbalization for corpus generation for zero-shot RAG. Built around efficient KG walks, our method does not require fine-tuning on domain-specific data, enabling seamless adaptation to KG updates, reducing computational overhead, and allowing integration with any off-the-shelf backbone LLM. Despite its simplicity, Walk&amp;Retrieve performs competitively, often outperforming existing RAG systems in response accuracy and hallucination reduction. Moreover, it demonstrates lower query latency and robust scalability to large KGs, highlighting the potential of lightweight retrieval strategies as strong baselines for future RAG research.

Abstract: Despite their staggering capabilities as assistant tools, often exceeding human performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) are still prone to jailbreak attempts from malevolent users. Although red teaming practices have already identified and helped to address several such jailbreak techniques, one particular sturdy approach involving role-playing (which we named `Goofy Game') seems effective against most of the current LLMs safeguards. This can result in the provision of unsafe content, which, although not harmful per se, might lead to dangerous consequences if delivered in a setting such as the medical domain. In this preliminary and exploratory study, we provide an initial analysis of how, even without technical knowledge of the internal architecture and parameters of generative AI models, a malicious user could construct a role-playing prompt capable of coercing an LLM into producing incorrect (and potentially harmful) clinical suggestions. We aim to illustrate a specific vulnerability scenario, providing insights that can support future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.

<title>ELDeR: Getting Efficient LLMs through Data-Driven Regularized Layer-wise Pruning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18232</link>

Abstract: The deployment of Large language models (LLMs) in many fields is largely hindered by their high computational and memory costs. Recent studies suggest that LLMs exhibit sparsity, which can be used for pruning. Previous pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned parts still contain valuable information, statically removing them without updating the remaining parameters often results in irreversible performance degradation, requiring costly recovery fine-tuning (RFT) to maintain performance. To address this, we propose a novel paradigm: first apply regularization, then prune. Based on this paradigm, we propose ELDeR: Getting Efficient LLMs through Data-Driven Regularized Layer-wise Pruning. We multiply the output of each transformer layer by an initial weight, then we iteratively learn the weights of each transformer layer by using a small amount of data in a simple way. After that, we apply regularization to the difference between the output and input of the layers with smaller weights, forcing the information to be transferred to the remaining layers. Compared with direct pruning, ELDeR reduces the information loss caused by direct parameter removal, thus better preserving the model's language modeling ability. Experimental results show that ELDeR achieves superior performance compared with powerful layer-wise structured pruning methods, while greatly reducing RFT computational costs. Since ELDeR is a layer-wise pruning method, its end-to-end acceleration effect is obvious, making it a promising technique for efficient LLMs.

<title>Collaborative Memory: Multi-User Memory Sharing in LLM Agents with Dynamic Access Control</title>

Abstract: Complex tasks are increasingly delegated to ensembles of specialized LLM-based agents that reason, communicate, and coordinate actions-both among themselves and through interactions with external tools, APIs, and databases. While persistent memory has been shown to enhance single-agent performance, most approaches assume a monolithic, single-user context-overlooking the benefits and challenges of knowledge transfer across users under dynamic, asymmetric permissions. We introduce Collaborative Memory, a framework for multi-user, multi-agent environments with asymmetric, time-evolving access controls encoded as bipartite graphs linking users, agents, and resources. Our system maintains two memory tiers: (1) private memory-private fragments visible only to their originating user; and (2) shared memory-selectively shared fragments. Each fragment carries immutable provenance attributes (contributing agents, accessed resources, and timestamps) to support retrospective permission checks. Granular read policies enforce current user-agent-resource constraints and project existing memory fragments into filtered transformed views. Write policies determine fragment retention and sharing, applying context-aware transformations to update the memory. Both policies may be designed conditioned on system, agent, and user-level information. Our framework enables safe, efficient, and interpretable cross-user knowledge sharing, with provable adherence to asymmetric, time-varying policies and full auditability of memory operations.

<title>Task Specific Pruning with LLM-Sieve: How Many Parameters Does Your Task Really Need?</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted for narrow tasks - such as medical question answering or sentiment analysis - and deployed in resource-constrained settings, a key question arises: how many parameters does a task actually need? In this work, we present LLM-Sieve, the first comprehensive framework for task-specific pruning of LLMs that achieves 20-75% parameter reduction with only 1-5% accuracy degradation across diverse domains. Unlike prior methods that apply uniform pruning or rely on low-rank approximations of weight matrices or inputs in isolation, LLM-Sieve (i) learns task-aware joint projections to better approximate output behavior, and (ii) employs a Genetic Algorithm to discover differentiated pruning levels for each matrix. LLM-Sieve is fully compatible with LoRA fine-tuning and quantization, and uniquely demonstrates strong generalization across datasets within the same task domain. Together, these results establish a practical and robust mechanism to generate smaller performant task-specific models.

Abstract: Enterprise search systems often struggle to retrieve accurate, domain-specific information due to semantic mismatches and overlapping terminologies. These issues can degrade the performance of downstream applications such as knowledge management, customer support, and retrieval-augmented generation agents. To address this challenge, we propose a scalable hard-negative mining framework tailored specifically for domain-specific enterprise data. Our approach dynamically selects semantically challenging but contextually irrelevant documents to enhance deployed re-ranking models.
  Our method integrates diverse embedding models, performs dimensionality reduction, and uniquely selects hard negatives, ensuring computational efficiency and semantic precision. Evaluation on our proprietary enterprise corpus (cloud services domain) demonstrates substantial improvements of 15\% in MRR@3 and 19\% in MRR@10 compared to state-of-the-art baselines and other negative sampling techniques. Further validation on public domain-specific datasets (FiQA, Climate Fever, TechQA) confirms our method's generalizability and readiness for real-world applications.

Abstract: Modern foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and large multi-modal models (LMMs) require a massive amount of computational and memory resources. We propose a new framework to convert such LLMs/LMMs into a reduced-dimension latent structure. Our method extends a local activation-aware tensor decomposition to a global attention-aware joint tensor de-composition. Our framework can significantly improve the model accuracy over the existing model compression methods when reducing the latent dimension to realize computationally/memory-efficient LLMs/LLMs. We show the benefit on several benchmark including multi-modal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: To tackle the huge computational demand of large foundation models, activation-aware compression techniques without retraining have been introduced. However, since these rely on calibration data, domain shift may arise for unknown downstream tasks. With a computationally efficient calibration, activation-aware pruning can be executed for every prompt adaptively, yet achieving reduced complexity at inference. We formulate it as a mixture of micro-experts, called $\mu$-MoE. Several experiments demonstrate that $\mu$-MoE can dynamically adapt to task/prompt-dependent structured sparsity on the fly.

Abstract: The integration of large language model (LLM) and data management (DATA) is rapidly redefining both domains. In this survey, we comprehensively review the bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, DATA4LLM, spanning large-scale data processing, storage, and serving, feeds LLMs with high quality, diversity, and timeliness of data required for stages like pre-training, post-training, retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic workflows: (i) Data processing for LLMs includes scalable acquisition, deduplication, filtering, selection, domain mixing, and synthetic augmentation; (ii) Data Storage for LLMs focuses on efficient data and model formats, distributed and heterogeneous storage hierarchies, KV-cache management, and fault-tolerant checkpointing; (iii) Data serving for LLMs tackles challenges in RAG (e.g., knowledge post-processing), LLM inference (e.g., prompt compression, data provenance), and training strategies (e.g., data packing and shuffling). On the other hand, in LLM4DATA, LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning, integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g., configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning, and multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: The growing demand for accessible mental health support, compounded by workforce shortages and logistical barriers, has led to increased interest in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for scalable and real-time assistance. However, their use in sensitive domains such as anxiety support remains underexamined. This study presents a systematic evaluation of LLMs (GPT and Llama) for their potential utility in anxiety support by using real user-generated posts from the r/Anxiety subreddit for both prompting and fine-tuning. Our approach utilizes a mixed-method evaluation framework incorporating three main categories of criteria: (i) linguistic quality, (ii) safety and trustworthiness, and (iii) supportiveness. Results show that fine-tuning LLMs with naturalistic anxiety-related data enhanced linguistic quality but increased toxicity and bias, and diminished emotional responsiveness. While LLMs exhibited limited empathy, GPT was evaluated as more supportive overall. Our findings highlight the risks of fine-tuning LLMs on unprocessed social media content without mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong performance in structured domains such as mathematics and programming; however, they often lack pedagogical coherence and realistic teaching behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pedagogy-R1, a framework that adapts LRMs for classroom use through three innovations: (1) a distillation-based pipeline that filters and refines model outputs for instruction-tuning, (2) the Well-balanced Educational Benchmark (WBEB), which evaluates performance across subject knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, tracing, essay scoring, and teacher decision-making, and (3) a Chain-of-Pedagogy (CoP) prompting strategy for generating and eliciting teacher-style reasoning. Our mixed-method evaluation combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, providing the first systematic assessment of LRMs' pedagogical strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Error correction is an important capability when applying large language models (LLMs) to facilitate user typing on mobile devices. In this paper, we use LLMs to synthesize a high-quality dataset of error correction pairs to evaluate and improve LLMs for mobile applications. We first prompt LLMs with error correction domain knowledge to build a scalable and reliable addition to the existing data synthesis pipeline. We then adapt the synthetic data distribution to match the mobile application domain by reweighting the samples. The reweighting model is learnt by predicting (a handful of) live A/B test metrics when deploying LLMs in production, given the LLM performance on offline evaluation data and scores from a small privacy-preserving on-device language model. Finally, we present best practices for mixing our synthetic data with other data sources to improve model performance on error correction in both offline evaluation and production live A/B testing.

Abstract: Cross-capability transfer is a key challenge in large language model (LLM) research, with applications in multi-task integration, model compression, and continual learning. Recent works like FuseLLM and FuseChat have demonstrated the potential of transferring multiple model capabilities to lightweight models, enhancing adaptability and efficiency, which motivates our investigation into more efficient cross-capability transfer methods. However, existing approaches primarily focus on small, homogeneous models, limiting their applicability. For large, heterogeneous models, knowledge distillation with full-parameter fine-tuning often overlooks the student model's intrinsic capacity and risks catastrophic forgetting, while PEFT methods struggle to effectively absorb knowledge from source LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce GraftLLM, a novel method that stores source model capabilities in a target model with SkillPack format. This approach preserves general capabilities, reduces parameter conflicts, and supports forget-free continual learning and model fusion. We employ a module-aware adaptive compression strategy to compress parameter updates, ensuring efficient storage while maintaining task-specific knowledge. The resulting SkillPack serves as a compact and transferable knowledge carrier, ideal for heterogeneous model fusion and continual learning. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate that GraftLLM outperforms existing techniques in knowledge transfer, knowledge fusion, and forget-free learning, providing a scalable and efficient solution for cross-capability transfer. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/duguodong7/GraftLLM.

Abstract: Listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) enhances top-ranked results in retrieval-based applications. Due to the limit in context size and high inference cost of long context, reranking is typically performed over a fixed size of small subsets, with the final ranking aggregated from these partial results. This fixed computation disregards query difficulty and document distribution, leading to inefficiencies. We propose AcuRank, an adaptive reranking framework that dynamically adjusts both the amount and target of computation based on uncertainty estimates over document relevance. Using a Bayesian TrueSkill model, we iteratively refine relevance estimates until reaching sufficient confidence levels, and our explicit modeling of ranking uncertainty enables principled control over reranking behavior and avoids unnecessary updates to confident predictions. Results on the TREC-DL and BEIR benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and scales better with compute than fixed-computation baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across diverse retrieval tasks and LLM-based reranking models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit strong biases, e.g, against women or in favor of the number 7. We investigate whether LLMs would be able to output less biased answers when allowed to observe their prior answers to the same question in a multi-turn conversation. To understand which types of questions invite more biased answers, we test LLMs on our proposed set of questions that span 9 topics and belong to three types: (1) Subjective; (2) Random; and (3) Objective. Interestingly, LLMs are able to "de-bias" themselves in a multi-turn conversation in response to questions that seek an Random, unbiased answer. Furthermore, we propose B-score, a novel metric that is effective in detecting biases to Subjective, Random, Easy, and Hard questions. On MMLU, HLE, and CSQA, leveraging B-score substantially improves the verification accuracy of LLM answers (i.e, accepting LLM correct answers and rejecting incorrect ones) compared to using verbalized confidence scores or the frequency of single-turn answers alone. Code and data are available at: https://b-score.github.io.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks, which has drawn significant attention to reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs. However, existing approaches allocate an equal number of rollouts to all questions during the RL process, which is inefficient. This inefficiency stems from the fact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more rollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers. Furthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's exploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of the base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for dynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems, enabling more efficient RL training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive dynamic temperature adjustment strategy to maintain the entropy at a stable level, thereby encouraging sufficient exploration. This enables LLMs to improve response precision while preserving their exploratory ability to uncover potential correct pathways.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a dominant AI paradigm due to their exceptional text understanding and generation capabilities. However, their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner, supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks: violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization across tasks, leading to increased interest in integrating speech with LLMs. These speech LLMs (SLLMs) typically use supervised fine-tuning to align speech with text-based LLMs. However, the lack of annotated speech data across a wide range of tasks hinders alignment efficiency, resulting in poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task 'behavior imitation' method with speech-text interleaving, called MTBI, which relies solely on paired speech and transcripts. By ensuring the LLM decoder generates equivalent responses to paired speech and text, we achieve a more generalized SLLM. Interleaving is used to further enhance alignment efficiency. We introduce a simple benchmark to evaluate prompt and task generalization across different models. Experimental results demonstrate that our MTBI outperforms SOTA SLLMs on both prompt and task generalization, while requiring less supervised speech data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in code generation tasks. To enable LLMs to address more complex coding challenges, existing research has focused on crafting multi-agent systems with agentic workflows, where complex coding tasks are decomposed into sub-tasks, assigned to specialized agents. Despite their effectiveness, current approaches heavily rely on hand-crafted agentic workflows, with both agent topologies and prompts manually designed, which limits their ability to automatically adapt to different types of coding problems. To address these limitations and enable automated workflow design, we propose \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{W}orkflow (\textbf{SEW}), a novel self-evolving framework that automatically generates and optimises multi-agent workflows. Extensive experiments on three coding benchmark datasets, including the challenging LiveCodeBench, demonstrate that our SEW can automatically design agentic workflows and optimise them through self-evolution, bringing up to 33\% improvement on LiveCodeBench compared to using the backbone LLM only. Furthermore, by investigating different representation schemes of workflow, we provide insights into the optimal way to encode workflow information with text.

Abstract: Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information. However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 330 chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning, 2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

<title>Can MLLMs Guide Me Home? A Benchmark Study on Fine-Grained Visual Reasoning from Transit Maps</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13 countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants, reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap between open-source and closed-source models.

<title>$PD^3F$: A Pluggable and Dynamic DoS-Defense Framework Against Resource Consumption Attacks Targeting Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), due to substantial computational requirements, are vulnerable to resource consumption attacks, which can severely degrade server performance or even cause crashes, as demonstrated by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks designed for LLMs. However, existing works lack mitigation strategies against such threats, resulting in unresolved security risks for real-world LLM deployments. To this end, we propose the Pluggable and Dynamic DoS-Defense Framework ($PD^3F$), which employs a two-stage approach to defend against resource consumption attacks from both the input and output sides. On the input side, we propose the Resource Index to guide Dynamic Request Polling Scheduling, thereby reducing resource usage induced by malicious attacks under high-concurrency scenarios. On the output side, we introduce the Adaptive End-Based Suppression mechanism, which terminates excessive malicious generation early. Experiments across six models demonstrate that $PD^3F$ significantly mitigates resource consumption attacks, improving users' access capacity by up to 500% during adversarial load. $PD^3F$ represents a step toward the resilient and resource-aware deployment of LLMs against resource consumption attacks.

Abstract: Foundation models and their checkpoints have significantly advanced deep learning, boosting performance across various applications. However, fine-tuned models often struggle outside their specific domains and exhibit considerable redundancy. Recent studies suggest that combining a pruned fine-tuned model with the original pre-trained model can mitigate forgetting, reduce interference when merging model parameters across tasks, and improve compression efficiency. In this context, developing an effective pruning strategy for fine-tuned models is crucial. Leveraging the advantages of the task vector mechanism, we preprocess fine-tuned models by calculating the differences between them and the original model. Recognizing that different task vector subspaces contribute variably to model performance, we introduce a novel method called Neural Parameter Search (NPS-Pruning) for slimming down fine-tuned models. This method enhances pruning efficiency by searching through neural parameters of task vectors within low-rank subspaces. Our method has three key applications: enhancing knowledge transfer through pairwise model interpolation, facilitating effective knowledge fusion via model merging, and enabling the deployment of compressed models that retain near-original performance while significantly reducing storage costs. Extensive experiments across vision, NLP, and multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, resulting in substantial performance gains. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/duguodong7/NPS-Pruning.

Abstract: Speech-based Parkinson's disease (PD) detection has gained attention for its automated, cost-effective, and non-intrusive nature. As research studies usually rely on data from diagnostic-oriented speech tasks, this work explores the feasibility of diagnosing PD on the basis of speech data not originally intended for diagnostic purposes, using the Turn-Taking (TT) dataset. Our findings indicate that TT can be as useful as diagnostic-oriented PD datasets like PC-GITA. We also investigate which specific dataset characteristics impact PD classification performance. The results show that concatenating audio recordings and balancing participants' gender and status distributions can be beneficial. Cross-dataset evaluation reveals that models trained on PC-GITA generalize poorly to TT, whereas models trained on TT perform better on PC-GITA. Furthermore, we provide insights into the high variability across folds, which is mainly due to large differences in individual speaker performance.

<title>From Output to Evaluation: Does Raw Instruction-Tuned Code LLMs Output Suffice for Fill-in-the-Middle Code Generation?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Post-processing is crucial for the automatic evaluation of LLMs in fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code generation due to the frequent presence of extraneous code in raw outputs. This extraneous generation suggests a lack of awareness regarding output boundaries, requiring truncation for effective evaluation. The determination of an optimal truncation strategy, however, often proves intricate, particularly when the scope includes several programming languages. This study investigates the necessity of post-processing instruction-tuned LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that supervised fine-tuning significantly enhances FIM code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code that seamlessly integrates with the surrounding context. Evaluating our fine-tuned \texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder} (base and instruct) models on HumanEval Infilling and SAFIM benchmarks demonstrates improved performances without post-processing, especially when the \emph{middle} consist of complete lines. However, post-processing of the LLM outputs remains necessary when the \emph{middle} is a random span of code.

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models demonstrate impressive problem-solving capabilities by employing sophisticated reasoning strategies. However, they often struggle to balance efficiency and effectiveness, frequently generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains for simple problems. In this work, we propose AdaCtrl, a novel framework to support both difficulty-aware adaptive reasoning budget allocation and explicit user control over reasoning depth. AdaCtrl dynamically adjusts its reasoning length based on self-assessed problem difficulty, while also allowing users to manually control the budget to prioritize either efficiency or effectiveness. This is achieved through a two-stage training pipeline: an initial cold-start fine-tuning phase to instill the ability to self-aware difficulty and adjust reasoning budget, followed by a difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (RL) stage that refines the model's adaptive reasoning strategies and calibrates its difficulty assessments based on its evolving capabilities during online training. To enable intuitive user interaction, we design explicit length-triggered tags that function as a natural interface for budget control. Empirical results show that AdaCtrl adapts reasoning length based on estimated difficulty, compared to the standard training baseline that also incorporates fine-tuning and RL, it yields performance improvements and simultaneously reduces response length by 10.06% and 12.14% on the more challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, which require elaborate reasoning, and by 62.05% and 91.04% on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets, where more concise responses are sufficient. Furthermore, AdaCtrl enables precise user control over the reasoning budget, allowing for tailored responses to meet specific needs.

<title>On the Effect of Negative Gradient in Group Relative Deep Reinforcement Optimization</title>

arXiv:2505.18830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become popular in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) emerging as a widely used algorithm in recent systems. Despite GRPO's widespread adoption, we identify a previously unrecognized phenomenon we term Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), wherein the likelihood of correct responses marginally increases or even decreases during training. This behavior mirrors a recently discovered misalignment issue in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), attributed to the influence of negative gradients. We provide a theoretical analysis of GRPO's learning dynamic, identifying the source of LLD as the naive penalization of all tokens in incorrect responses with the same strength. To address this, we develop a method called NTHR, which downweights penalties on tokens contributing to the LLD. Unlike prior DPO-based approaches, NTHR takes advantage of GRPO's group-based structure, using correct responses as anchors to identify influential tokens. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that NTHR effectively mitigates LLD, yielding consistent performance gains across models ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters.

<title>Signal, Image, or Symbolic: Exploring the Best Input Representation for Electrocardiogram-Language Models Through a Unified Framework</title>

Abstract: Recent advances have increasingly applied large language models (LLMs) to electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, giving rise to Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs). Conditioned on an ECG and a textual query, an ELM autoregressively generates a free-form textual response. Unlike traditional classification-based systems, ELMs emulate expert cardiac electrophysiologists by issuing diagnoses, analyzing waveform morphology, identifying contributing factors, and proposing patient-specific action plans. To realize this potential, researchers are curating instruction-tuning datasets that pair ECGs with textual dialogues and are training ELMs on these resources. Yet before scaling ELMs further, there is a fundamental question yet to be explored: What is the most effective ECG input representation? In recent works, three candidate representations have emerged-raw time-series signals, rendered images, and discretized symbolic sequences. We present the first comprehensive benchmark of these modalities across 6 public datasets and 5 evaluation metrics. We find symbolic representations achieve the greatest number of statistically significant wins over both signal and image inputs. We further ablate the LLM backbone, ECG duration, and token budget, and we evaluate robustness to signal perturbations. We hope that our findings offer clear guidance for selecting input representations when developing the next generation of ELMs.

Abstract: This work investigates the optimal allocation of inference compute across three key scaling factors in video vision language models: language model size, frame count, and the number of visual tokens per frame. While prior works typically focuses on optimizing model efficiency or improving performance without considering resource constraints, we instead identify optimal model configuration under fixed inference compute budgets. We conduct large-scale training sweeps and careful parametric modeling of task performance to identify the inference compute-optimal frontier. Our experiments reveal how task performance depends on scaling factors and finetuning data size, as well as how changes in data size shift the compute-optimal frontier. These findings translate to practical tips for selecting these scaling factors.

Abstract: The advancements of Large language models (LLMs) have provided great opportunities to text-to-SQL tasks to overcome the main challenges to understand complex domain information and complex database structures in business applications. In this paper, we propose a meta-aware learning framework to integrate domain knowledge, database schema, chain-of-thought reasoning processes, and metadata relationships to improve the SQL generation quality. The proposed framework includes four learning strategies: schema-based learning, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning, knowledge-enhanced learning, and key information tokenization. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of database structure and metadata information towards LLM through fine-tuning to improve its performance on SQL generation within business domains. Through two experimental studies, we have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed methods in execution accuracy, multi-task SQL generation capability, and reduction of catastrophic forgetting.

<title>Can Large Language Models Infer Causal Relationships from Real-World Text?</title>

Abstract: Understanding and inferring causal relationships from texts is a core aspect of human cognition and is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs) towards artificial general intelligence. Existing work primarily focuses on synthetically generated texts which involve simple causal relationships explicitly mentioned in the text. This fails to reflect the complexities of real-world tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs are capable of inferring causal relationships from real-world texts. We develop a benchmark drawn from real-world academic literature which includes diverse texts with respect to length, complexity of relationships (different levels of explicitness, number of events, and causal relationships), and domains and sub-domains. To the best of our knowledge, our benchmark is the first-ever real-world dataset for this task. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs evaluated on our proposed benchmark demonstrate significant challenges, with the best-performing model achieving an average F1 score of only 0.477. Analysis reveals common pitfalls: difficulty with implicitly stated information, in distinguishing relevant causal factors from surrounding contextual details, and with connecting causally relevant information spread across lengthy textual passages. By systematically characterizing these deficiencies, our benchmark offers targeted insights for further research into advancing LLM causal reasoning.

Abstract: Large language model editing methods frequently suffer from overfitting, wherein factual updates can propagate beyond their intended scope, overemphasizing the edited target even when it's contextually inappropriate. To address this challenge, we introduce REACT (Representation Extraction And Controllable Tuning), a unified two-phase framework designed for precise and controllable knowledge editing. In the initial phase, we utilize tailored stimuli to extract latent factual representations and apply Principal Component Analysis with a simple learnbale linear transformation to compute a directional "belief shift" vector for each instance. In the second phase, we apply controllable perturbations to hidden states using the obtained vector with a magnitude scalar, gated by a pre-trained classifier that permits edits only when contextually necessary. Relevant experiments on EVOKE benchmarks demonstrate that REACT significantly reduces overfitting across nearly all evaluation metrics, and experiments on COUNTERFACT and MQuAKE shows that our method preserves balanced basic editing performance (reliability, locality, and generality) under diverse editing scenarios.

Abstract: This paper calls on the research community not only to investigate how human biases are inherited by large language models (LLMs) but also to explore how these biases in LLMs can be leveraged to make society's "unwritten code" - such as implicit stereotypes and heuristics - visible and accessible for critique. We introduce a conceptual framework through a case study in science: uncovering hidden rules in peer review - the factors that reviewers care about but rarely state explicitly due to normative scientific expectations. The idea of the framework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating self-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer scoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 computer science conferences, while iteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where existing hypotheses cannot explain. We observed that LLMs' normative priors about the internal characteristics of good science extracted from their self-talk, e.g. theoretical rigor, were systematically updated toward posteriors that emphasize storytelling about external connections, such as how the work is positioned and connected within and across literatures. This shift reveals the primacy of scientific myths about intrinsic properties driving scientific excellence rather than extrinsic contextualization and storytelling that influence conceptions of relevance and significance. Human reviewers tend to explicitly reward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors (correlation = 0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling posteriors in their review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving implicit reward to them with positive scores. We discuss the broad applicability of the framework, leveraging LLMs as diagnostic tools to surface the tacit codes underlying human society, enabling more precisely targeted responsible AI.

Abstract: While diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with their ability to synthesize realistic and diverse scenes, they continue to struggle to generate consistent and legible text within images. This shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal generative modeling. We release our entire evaluation pipeline at https://github.com/tianyu-z/STRICT-Bench.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has become a critical research area because integrating text and image data can significantly improve performance in tasks such as classification, retrieval, and scene understanding. However, despite progress with pre-trained models, current approaches are limited by inadequate cross-modal interactions and static fusion strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary nature of different modalities. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel multi-modal Co-AttenDWG architecture that leverages dual-path encoding, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and advanced expert fusion. Our approach begins by projecting text and image features into a common embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention mechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities. This mechanism is further enhanced by a dimension-wise gating network that adaptively regulates the feature contributions at the channel level, ensuring that only the most relevant information is emphasized. In parallel, dual-path encoders refine the representations by processing cross-modal information separately before an additional cross-attention layer further aligns modalities. The refined features are then aggregated via an expert fusion module that combines learned gating and self-attention to produce a robust, unified representation. We validate our approach on the MIMIC and SemEval Memotion 1.0, where experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in cross-modal alignment and state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the potential of our model for a wide range of multi-modal applications.

Abstract: We introduce Speech-IFeval, an evaluation framework designed to assess instruction-following capabilities and quantify catastrophic forgetting in speech-aware language models (SLMs). Recent SLMs integrate speech perception with large language models (LLMs), often degrading textual capabilities due to speech-centric training. Existing benchmarks conflate speech perception with instruction-following, hindering evaluation of these distinct skills. To address this gap, we provide a benchmark for diagnosing the instruction-following abilities of SLMs. Our findings show that most SLMs struggle with even basic instructions, performing far worse than text-based LLMs. Additionally, these models are highly sensitive to prompt variations, often yielding inconsistent and unreliable outputs. We highlight core challenges and provide insights to guide future research, emphasizing the need for evaluation beyond task-level metrics.

<title>Universal Reasoner: A Single, Composable Plug-and-Play Reasoner for Frozen LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general capabilities, but enhancing skills such as reasoning often demands substantial computational resources and may compromise their generalization. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone. This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR significantly outperforms \add{existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the Llama3.2 model}. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core capabilities.

Abstract: Due to the auto-regressive nature of current video large language models (Video-LLMs), the inference latency increases as the input sequence length grows, posing challenges for the efficient processing of video sequences that are usually very long. We observe that during decoding, the attention scores of most tokens in Video-LLMs tend to be sparse and concentrated, with only certain tokens requiring comprehensive full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce Sparse-to-Dense (StD), a novel decoding strategy that integrates two distinct modules: one leveraging sparse top-K attention and the other employing dense full attention. These modules collaborate to accelerate Video-LLMs without loss. The fast (sparse) model speculatively decodes multiple tokens, while the slow (dense) model verifies them in parallel. StD is a tuning-free, plug-and-play solution that achieves up to a 1.94$\times$ walltime speedup in video processing. It maintains model performance while enabling a seamless transition from a standard Video-LLM to a sparse Video-LLM with minimal code modifications.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) enables the development of intelligent agents capable of engaging in complex and multi-turn dialogues. However, multi-agent collaboration face critical safety challenges, such as hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph, GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an incremental training paradigm, learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.

Abstract: This paper argues that token prediction is fundamentally misaligned with real creativity. While next-token models have enabled impressive advances in language generation, their architecture favours surface-level coherence over spontaneity, originality, and improvisational risk. We use battle rap as a case study to expose the limitations of predictive systems, demonstrating that they cannot truly engage in adversarial or emotionally resonant exchanges. By reframing creativity as an interactive process rather than a predictive output, we offer a vision for AI systems that are more expressive, responsive, and aligned with human creative practice.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio language models (LALMs) have demonstrated impressive results and promising prospects in universal understanding and reasoning across speech, music, and general sound. However, these models still lack the ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries and refuse to answer questions they don't know proactively. While there have been successful attempts to enhance the reliability of LLMs, reliable LALMs remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate various approaches towards reliable LALMs, including training-free methods such as multi-modal chain-of-thought (MCoT), and training-based methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Besides, we identify the limitations of previous evaluation metrics and propose a new metric, the Reliability Gain Index (RGI), to assess the effectiveness of different reliable methods. Our findings suggest that both training-free and training-based methods enhance the reliability of LALMs to different extents. Moreover, we find that awareness of reliability is a "meta ability", which can be transferred across different audio modalities, although significant structural and content differences exist among sound, music, and speech.

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) systems translate natural language into SQL queries, allowing users with no technical background to interact with databases and create tools like reports or visualizations. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved NL2SQL accuracy, schema ambiguity remains a major challenge in enterprise environments with complex schemas, where multiple tables and columns with semantically similar names often co-exist. To address schema ambiguity, we introduce ODIN, a NL2SQL recommendation engine. Instead of producing a single SQL query given a natural language question, ODIN generates a set of potential SQL queries by accounting for different interpretations of ambiguous schema components. ODIN dynamically adjusts the number of suggestions based on the level of ambiguity, and ODIN learns from user feedback to personalize future SQL query recommendations. Our evaluation shows that ODIN improves the likelihood of generating the correct SQL query by 1.5-2$\times$ compared to baselines.

<title>Architectures of Error: A Philosophical Inquiry into AI and Human Code Generation</title>

Abstract: With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models are increasingly employed for code generation, becoming active co-authors alongside human programmers. Focusing specifically on this application domain, this paper articulates distinct ``Architectures of Error'' to ground an epistemic distinction between human and machine code generation. Examined through their shared vulnerability to error, this distinction reveals fundamentally different causal origins: human-cognitive versus artificial-stochastic. To develop this framework and substantiate the distinction, the analysis draws critically upon Dennett's mechanistic functionalism and Rescher's methodological pragmatism. I argue that a systematic differentiation of these error profiles raises critical philosophical questions concerning semantic coherence, security robustness, epistemic limits, and control mechanisms in human-AI collaborative software development. The paper also utilizes Floridi's levels of abstraction to provide a nuanced understanding of how these error dimensions interact and may evolve with technological advancements. This analysis aims to offer philosophers a structured framework for understanding GenAI's unique epistemological challenges, shaped by these architectural foundations, while also providing software engineers a basis for more critically informed engagement.

<title>Optimized Text Embedding Models and Benchmarks for Amharic Passage Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Neural retrieval methods using transformer-based pre-trained language models have advanced multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval. However, their effectiveness for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Amharic remains underexplored due to data scarcity and suboptimal tokenization. We address this gap by introducing Amharic-specific dense retrieval models based on pre-trained Amharic BERT and RoBERTa backbones. Our proposed RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed model (110M parameters) achieves a 17.6% relative improvement in MRR@10 and a 9.86% gain in Recall@10 over the strongest multilingual baseline, Arctic Embed 2.0 (568M parameters). More compact variants, such as RoBERTa-Medium-Amharic-Embed (42M), remain competitive while being over 13x smaller. Additionally, we train a ColBERT-based late interaction retrieval model that achieves the highest MRR@10 score (0.843) among all evaluated models. We benchmark our proposed models against both sparse and dense retrieval baselines to systematically assess retrieval effectiveness in Amharic. Our analysis highlights key challenges in low-resource settings and underscores the importance of language-specific adaptation. To foster future research in low-resource IR, we publicly release our dataset, codebase, and trained models at https://github.com/kidist-amde/amharic-ir-benchmarks.

<title>Task Memory Engine: Spatial Memory for Robust Multi-Step LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19436</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) falter in multi-step interactions -- often hallucinating, repeating actions, or misinterpreting user corrections -- due to reliance on linear, unstructured context. This fragility stems from the lack of persistent memory to track evolving goals and task dependencies, undermining trust in autonomous agents. We introduce the Task Memory Engine (TME), a modular memory controller that transforms existing LLMs into robust, revision-aware agents without fine-tuning. TME implements a spatial memory framework that replaces flat context with graph-based structures to support consistent, multi-turn reasoning. Departing from linear concatenation and ReAct-style prompting, TME builds a dynamic task graph -- either a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- to map user inputs to subtasks, align them with prior context, and enable dependency-tracked revisions. Its Task Representation and Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to ensure accurate interpretation. Across four multi-turn scenarios-trip planning, cooking, meeting scheduling, and shopping cart editing -- TME eliminates 100% of hallucinations and misinterpretations in three tasks, and reduces hallucinations by 66.7% and misinterpretations by 83.3% across 27 user turns, outperforming ReAct. TME's modular design supports plug-and-play deployment and domain-specific customization, adaptable to both personal assistants and enterprise automation. We release TME's codebase, benchmarks, and components as open-source resources, enabling researchers to develop reliable LLM agents. TME's scalable architecture addresses a critical gap in agent performance across complex, interactive settings.

<title>Vibe Coding vs. Agentic Coding: Fundamentals and Practical Implications of Agentic AI</title>

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive analysis of two emerging paradigms in AI-assisted software development: vibe coding and agentic coding. While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.

Abstract: Large language models excel in general tasks, yet assessing their reliability in logic-heavy, precision-critical domains like finance, law, and healthcare remains challenging. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world financial applications. BizFinBench consists of 6,781 well-annotated queries in Chinese, spanning five dimensions: numerical calculation, reasoning, information extraction, prediction recognition, and knowledge-based question answering, grouped into nine fine-grained categories. The benchmark includes both objective and subjective metrics. We also introduce IteraJudge, a novel LLM evaluation method that reduces bias when LLMs serve as evaluators in objective metrics. We benchmark 25 models, including both proprietary and open-source systems. Extensive experiments show that no model dominates across all tasks. Our evaluation reveals distinct capability patterns: (1) In Numerical Calculation, Claude-3.5-Sonnet (63.18) and DeepSeek-R1 (64.04) lead, while smaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B (15.92) lag significantly; (2) In Reasoning, proprietary models dominate (ChatGPT-o3: 83.58, Gemini-2.0-Flash: 81.15), with open-source models trailing by up to 19.49 points; (3) In Information Extraction, the performance spread is the largest, with DeepSeek-R1 scoring 71.46, while Qwen3-1.7B scores 11.23; (4) In Prediction Recognition, performance variance is minimal, with top models scoring between 39.16 and 50.00. We find that while current LLMs handle routine finance queries competently, they struggle with complex scenarios requiring cross-concept reasoning. BizFinBench offers a rigorous, business-aligned benchmark for future research. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HiThink-Research/BizFinBench.

<title>DOGe: Defensive Output Generation for LLM Protection Against Knowledge Distillation</title>

arXiv:2505.19504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent substantial intellectual and economic investments, yet their effectiveness can inadvertently facilitate model imitation via knowledge distillation (KD).In practical scenarios, competitors can distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly accessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by observation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify imitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the teacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation purely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of actively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access. We introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe) strategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs remain accurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for distillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by fine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial loss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation attempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving or even improving the original performance of the teacher model, student models distilled from the defensively generated teacher outputs demonstrate catastrophically reduced performance, demonstrating our method's effectiveness as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.

<title>FlowCut: Rethinking Redundancy via Information Flow for Efficient Vision-Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration; and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x speed-up in the prefilling stage.

<title>Automated Text-to-Table for Reasoning-Intensive Table QA: Pipeline Design and Benchmarking Insights</title>

Abstract: Reasoning with tabular data holds increasing importance in modern applications, yet comprehensive evaluation methodologies for reasoning-intensive Table Question Answering (QA) tasks remain nascent. Existing research is constrained by two primary bottlenecks: 1) Reliance on costly manually annotated real-world data, which is difficult to cover complex reasoning scenarios; 2) The heterogeneity of table structures hinders systematic analysis of the intrinsic mechanisms behind the underperformance of LLMs, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. To address these issues, we propose an automated generation pipeline AutoT2T that transforms mathematical word problems into table-based reasoning tasks, eliminating the need for manual annotation. The pipeline can generate multiple variants of a table for the same reasoning problem, including noisy versions to support robustness evaluation. Based on this, we construct a new benchmark TabularGSM, which systematically spans a range of table complexities and trap problems. Experimental analyses through AutoT2T and TabularGSM reveal that the tight coupling between reasoning and retrieval or identification processes is a key factor underlying the failure of LLMs in complex Table QA tasks. This highlights the necessity for models to develop synergistic reasoning capabilities in order to perform effectively in complex Table QA tasks.

<title>Accelerating Prefilling for Long-Context LLMs via Sparse Pattern Sharing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse attention methods exploit the inherent sparsity in attention to speed up the prefilling phase of long-context inference, mitigating the quadratic complexity of full attention computation. While existing sparse attention methods rely on predefined patterns or inaccurate estimations to approximate attention behavior, they often fail to fully capture the true dynamics of attention, resulting in reduced efficiency and compromised accuracy. Instead, we propose a highly accurate sparse attention mechanism that shares similar yet precise attention patterns across heads, enabling a more realistic capture of the dynamic behavior of attention. Our approach is grounded in two key observations: (1) attention patterns demonstrate strong inter-head similarity, and (2) this similarity remains remarkably consistent across diverse inputs. By strategically sharing computed accurate patterns across attention heads, our method effectively captures actual patterns while requiring full attention computation for only a small subset of heads. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior or comparable speedup relative to state-of-the-art methods while delivering the best overall accuracy.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for complex reasoning via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is effective but limited by reliance on costly, domain-specific supervision. We explore Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), a framework that enables LLMs to learn from intrinsic signals without external rewards or labeled data. We propose Intuitor, an RLIF method that uses a model's own confidence, termed self-certainty, as its sole reward signal. Intuitor replaces external rewards in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-certainty scores, enabling fully unsupervised learning. Experiments demonstrate that Intuitor matches GRPO's performance on mathematical benchmarks while achieving superior generalization to out-of-domain tasks like code generation, without requiring gold solutions or test cases. Our findings show that intrinsic model signals can drive effective learning across domains, offering a scalable alternative to RLVR for autonomous AI systems where verifiable rewards are unavailable.

<title>Preference Optimization by Estimating the Ratio of the Data Distribution</title>

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) is widely used as a simple and stable method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. This paper investigates a generalized DPO loss that enables a policy model to match the target policy from a likelihood ratio estimation perspective. The ratio of the target policy provides a unique identification of the policy distribution without relying on reward models or partition functions. This allows the generalized loss to retain both simplicity and theoretical guarantees, which prior work such as $f$-PO fails to achieve simultaneously. We propose Bregman preference optimization (BPO), a generalized framework for ratio matching that provides a family of objective functions achieving target policy optimality. BPO subsumes DPO as a special case and offers tractable forms for all instances, allowing implementation with a few lines of code. We further develop scaled Basu's power divergence (SBA), a gradient scaling method that can be used for BPO instances. The BPO framework complements other DPO variants and is applicable to target policies defined by these variants. In experiments, unlike other probabilistic loss extensions such as $f$-DPO or $f$-PO, which exhibit a trade-off between generation fidelity and diversity, instances of BPO improve both win rate and entropy compared with DPO. When applied to Llama-3-Instruct-8B, BPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among Llama-3-8B backbones, with a 55.9\% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become deeply integrated into human life and increasingly influence decision-making, it's crucial to evaluate whether and to what extent they exhibit subjective preferences, opinions, and beliefs. These tendencies may stem from biases within the models, which may shape their behavior, influence the advice and recommendations they offer to users, and potentially reinforce certain viewpoints. This paper presents the Preference, Opinion, and Belief survey (POBs), a benchmark developed to assess LLMs' subjective inclinations across societal, cultural, ethical, and personal domains. We applied our benchmark to evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, measuring desired properties such as reliability, neutrality, and consistency. In addition, we investigated the effect of increasing the test-time compute, through reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms, on those metrics. While effective in other tasks, our results show that these mechanisms offer only limited gains in our domain. Furthermore, we reveal that newer model versions are becoming less consistent and more biased toward specific viewpoints, highlighting a blind spot and a concerning trend.

Abstract: Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.

Abstract: Planning represents a fundamental capability of intelligent agents, requiring comprehensive environmental understanding, rigorous logical reasoning, and effective sequential decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on certain planning tasks, their broader application in this domain warrants systematic investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive review of LLM-based planning. Specifically, this survey is structured as follows: First, we establish the theoretical foundations by introducing essential definitions and categories about automated planning. Next, we provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of contemporary LLM-based planning methodologies, categorizing them into three principal approaches: 1) External Module Augmented Methods that combine LLMs with additional components for planning, 2) Finetuning-based Methods that involve using trajectory data and feedback signals to adjust LLMs in order to improve their planning abilities, and 3) Searching-based Methods that break down complex tasks into simpler components, navigate the planning space, or enhance decoding strategies to find the best solutions. Subsequently, we systematically summarize existing evaluation frameworks, including benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics and performance comparisons between representative planning methods. Finally, we discuss the underlying mechanisms enabling LLM-based planning and outline promising research directions for this rapidly evolving field. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this field.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in discrete data modeling. However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate transition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of latent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also constrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose Discrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete representation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix Learning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the convergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space complexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior studies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific generation approaches.

Abstract: Effective generation of structured code comments requires robust quality metrics for dataset curation, yet existing approaches (SIDE, MIDQ, STASIS) suffer from limited code-comment analysis. We propose CIDRe, a language-agnostic reference-free quality criterion combining four synergistic aspects: (1) relevance (code-comment semantic alignment), (2) informativeness (functional coverage), (3) completeness (presence of all structure sections), and (4) description length (detail sufficiency). We validate our criterion on a manually annotated dataset. Experiments demonstrate CIDRe's superiority over existing metrics, achieving improvement in cross-entropy evaluation. When applied to filter comments, the models finetuned on CIDRe-filtered data show statistically significant quality gains in GPT-4o-mini assessments.

<title>Understanding the Performance Gap in Preference Learning: A Dichotomy of RLHF and DPO</title>

Abstract: We present a fine-grained theoretical analysis of the performance gap between reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under a representation gap. Our study decomposes this gap into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or online DPO can outperform one another depending on the type of model mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning. Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer practical insights into when each method is preferred.

<title>HS-STAR: Hierarchical Sampling for Self-Taught Reasoners via Difficulty Estimation and Budget Reallocation</title>

Abstract: Self-taught reasoners (STaRs) enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging self-generated responses for self-training. Recent studies have incorporated reward models to guide response selection or decoding, aiming to obtain higher-quality data. However, they typically allocate a uniform sampling budget across all problems, overlooking the varying utility of problems at different difficulty levels. In this work, we conduct an empirical study and find that problems near the boundary of the LLM's reasoning capability offer significantly greater learning utility than both easy and overly difficult ones. To identify and exploit such problems, we propose HS-STaR, a Hierarchical Sampling framework for Self-Taught Reasoners. Given a fixed sampling budget, HS-STaR first performs lightweight pre-sampling with a reward-guided difficulty estimation strategy to efficiently identify boundary-level problems. Subsequently, it dynamically reallocates the remaining budget toward these high-utility problems during a re-sampling phase, maximizing the generation of valuable training data. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks and backbone LLMs demonstrate that HS-STaR significantly outperforms other baselines without requiring additional sampling budget.

<title>ESLM: Risk-Averse Selective Language Modeling for Efficient Pretraining</title>

Abstract: Large language model pretraining is compute-intensive, yet many tokens contribute marginally to learning, resulting in inefficiency. We introduce Efficient Selective Language Modeling (ESLM), a risk-aware algorithm that improves training efficiency and distributional robustness by performing online token-level batch selection. ESLM leverages per-token statistics (e.g., entropy or loss) and applies value-at-risk thresholding to retain only the most informative tokens per batch. This data-centric mechanism reshapes the training loss, prioritizing high-risk tokens and eliminating redundant gradient computation. We frame ESLM as a bilevel game: the model competes with a masking adversary that selects worst-case token subsets under a constrained thresholding rule. In the loss-based setting, ESLM recovers conditional value-at-risk loss minimization, providing a principled connection to distributionally robust optimization. We extend our approach to Ada-ESLM, which adaptively tunes the selection confidence during training. Experiments on GPT-2 pretraining show that ESLM significantly reduces training FLOPs while maintaining or improving both perplexity and downstream performance compared to baselines. Our approach also scales across model sizes, pretraining corpora, and integrates naturally with knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Recent trends are emerging in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents that take actions based on the content of the user text prompts. We intend to apply these concepts to the field of Control in space, enabling LLMs to play a significant role in the decision-making process for autonomous satellite operations. As a first step towards this goal, we have developed a pure LLM-based solution for the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software design competition where participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering satellites involved in non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP game engine. Our approach leverages prompt engineering, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning techniques to create an effective LLM-based agent that ranked 2nd in the competition. To the best of our knowledge, this work pioneers the integration of LLM agents into space research. The project comprises several open repositories to facilitate replication and further research. The codebase is accessible on \href{https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/kspdg}{GitHub}, while the trained models and datasets are available on \href{https://huggingface.co/OhhTuRnz}{Hugging Face}.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and (ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code, environment, and benchmark are at https://qiushisun.github.io/ScienceBoard-Home/.

Abstract: The diagram is a visual representation of a relationship illustrated with edges (lines or arrows), which is widely used in industrial and scientific communication. Although recognizing diagrams is essential for vision language models (VLMs) to comprehend domain-specific knowledge, recent studies reveal that many VLMs fail to identify edges in images. We hypothesize that these failures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases, preventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we empirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge representation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased neither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct contrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to train an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three tasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the finetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses zero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task. These findings confirm that eliminating textual and positional biases fosters accurate edge recognition in VLMs, offering a promising path for advancing diagram understanding.

<title>An Explainable Diagnostic Framework for Neurodegenerative Dementias via Reinforcement-Optimized LLM Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19954</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.19954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias is a challenging clinical task, mainly because of the overlap in symptom presentation and the similarity of patterns observed in structural neuroimaging. To improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, deep learning-based methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers have been proposed for the automatic classification of brain MRIs. However, despite their strong predictive performance, these models find limited clinical utility due to their opaque decision making. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates two core components to enhance diagnostic transparency. First, we introduce a modular pipeline for converting 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs into textual radiology reports. Second, we explore the potential of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis between Frontotemporal dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging based on the generated reports. To bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and explainability, we employ reinforcement learning to incentivize diagnostic reasoning in LLMs. Without requiring supervised reasoning traces or distillation from larger models, our approach enables the emergence of structured diagnostic rationales grounded in neuroimaging findings. Unlike post-hoc explainability methods that retrospectively justify model decisions, our framework generates diagnostic rationales as part of the inference process-producing causally grounded explanations that inform and guide the model's decision-making process. In doing so, our framework matches the diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods while offering rationales that support its diagnostic conclusions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, which translates a natural language question into an SQL query, has advanced with in-context learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods show little improvement in performance compared to randomly chosen demonstrations, and significant performance drops when smaller LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) are used. This indicates that these methods heavily rely on the intrinsic capabilities of hyper-scaled LLMs, rather than effectively retrieving useful demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for effectively retrieving demonstrations and generating SQL queries. We construct a Deep Contextual Schema Link Graph, which contains key information and semantic relationship between a question and its database schema items. This graph-based structure enables effective representation of Text-to-SQL samples and retrieval of useful demonstrations for in-context learning. Experimental results on the Spider benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing consistent improvements in SQL generation performance and efficiency across both hyper-scaled LLMs and small LLMs. Our code will be released.

<title>The Limits of Preference Data for Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Recent progress in strengthening the capabilities of large language models has stemmed from applying reinforcement learning to domains with automatically verifiable outcomes. A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to optimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires human feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning, outcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of success. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is preference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$ given outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical roadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based optimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and online), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately optimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing an analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose a candidate to elect. This indicates that grounded human scoring and algorithmic innovations are necessary for extending the success of RL post-training to domains demanding human feedback. We also explore why these limitations have disproportionately impacted RLHF when it comes to eliciting reasoning behaviors (e.g., backtracking) versus situations where RLHF has been historically successful (e.g., instruction-tuning and safety training), finding that the limitations of preference data primarily suppress RLHF's ability to elicit robust strategies -- a class that encompasses most reasoning behaviors.

<title>Embracing Imperfection: Simulating Students with Diverse Cognitive Levels Using LLM-based Agents</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based agents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful assistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the \texttt{Student\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python programming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\%$ improvement in simulation accuracy.

Abstract: Despite participants engaging in unimodal stimuli, such as watching images or silent videos, recent work has demonstrated that multi-modal Transformer models can predict visual brain activity impressively well, even with incongruent modality representations. This raises the question of how accurately these multi-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in multi-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in studying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such multi-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates information across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to higher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and two types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine which type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants are engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal models show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This study also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus multi-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each modality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one by one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional information beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and language regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for cross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video modality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the video and audio modalities. This serves as a strong motivation for the neuroscience community to investigate the interpretability of these models for deepening our understanding of multi-modal information processing in brain.

REARANK explicitly reasons before reranking, significantly improving both performance and interpretability. Leveraging reinforcement learning and data augmentation, REARANK achieves substantial improvements over baseline models across popular information retrieval benchmarks, notably requiring only 179 annotated samples. Built on top of Qwen2.5-7B, our REARANK-7B demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4 on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks and even surpasses GPT-4 on reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmarks. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach and highlight how reinforcement learning can enhance LLM reasoning capabilities in reranking.

Abstract: Voice disorders significantly impact patient quality of life, yet non-invasive automated diagnosis remains under-explored due to both the scarcity of pathological voice data, and the variability in recording sources. This work introduces MVP (Multi-source Voice Pathology detection), a novel approach that leverages transformers operating directly on raw voice signals. We explore three fusion strategies to combine sentence reading and sustained vowel recordings: waveform concatenation, intermediate feature fusion, and decision-level combination. Empirical validation across the German, Portuguese, and Italian languages shows that intermediate feature fusion using transformers best captures the complementary characteristics of both recording types. Our approach achieves up to +13% AUC improvement over single-source methods.

<title>Multimodal LLM-Guided Semantic Correction in Text-to-Image Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.

<title>SAEs Are Good for Steering -- If You Select the Right Features</title>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed as an unsupervised approach to learn a decomposition of a model's latent space. This enables useful applications such as steering - influencing the output of a model towards a desired concept - without requiring labeled data. Current methods identify SAE features to steer by analyzing the input tokens that activate them. However, recent work has highlighted that activations alone do not fully describe the effect of a feature on the model's output. In this work, we draw a distinction between two types of features: input features, which mainly capture patterns in the model's input, and output features, which have a human-understandable effect on the model's output. We propose input and output scores to characterize and locate these types of features, and show that high values for both scores rarely co-occur in the same features. These findings have practical implications: after filtering out features with low output scores, we obtain 2-3x improvements when steering with SAEs, making them competitive with supervised methods.

Abstract: Reasoning-based language models have demonstrated strong performance across various domains, with the most notable gains seen in mathematical and coding tasks. Recent research has shown that reasoning also offers significant benefits for LLM safety and guardrail applications. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of training reasoning-based guardrail models for content moderation, with an emphasis on generalization to custom safety policies at inference time. Our study focuses on two key dimensions: data efficiency and inference efficiency. On the data front, we find that reasoning-based models exhibit strong sample efficiency, achieving competitive performance with significantly fewer training examples than their non-reasoning counterparts. This unlocks the potential to repurpose the remaining data for mining high-value, difficult samples that further enhance model performance. On the inference side, we evaluate practical trade-offs by introducing reasoning budgets, examining the impact of reasoning length on latency and accuracy, and exploring dual-mode training to allow runtime control over reasoning behavior. Our findings will provide practical insights for researchers and developers to effectively and efficiently train and deploy reasoning-based guardrails models in real-world systems.

Abstract: Citations are crucial in scientific research articles as they highlight the connection between the current study and prior work. However, this process is often time-consuming for researchers. In this study, we propose the SciRGC framework, which aims to automatically recommend citation articles and generate citation sentences for citation locations within articles. The framework addresses two key challenges in academic citation generation: 1) how to accurately identify the author's citation intent and find relevant citation papers, and 2) how to generate high-quality citation sentences that align with human preferences. We enhance citation recommendation accuracy in the citation article recommendation module by incorporating citation networks and sentiment intent, and generate reasoning-based citation sentences in the citation sentence generation module by using the original article abstract, local context, citation intent, and recommended articles as inputs. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation metric to fairly assess the quality of generated citation sentences. Through comparisons with baseline models and ablation experiments, the SciRGC framework not only improves the accuracy and relevance of citation recommendations but also ensures the appropriateness of the generated citation sentences in context, providing a valuable tool for interdisciplinary researchers.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to software development workflows, their ability to generate structured outputs has become critically important. We introduce StructEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in producing both non-renderable (JSON, YAML, CSV) and renderable (HTML, React, SVG) structured formats. Unlike prior benchmarks, StructEval systematically evaluates structural fidelity across diverse formats through two paradigms: 1) generation tasks, producing structured output from natural language prompts, and 2) conversion tasks, translating between structured formats. Our benchmark encompasses 18 formats and 44 types of task, with novel metrics for format adherence and structural correctness. Results reveal significant performance gaps, even state-of-the-art models like o1-mini achieve only 75.58 average score, with open-source alternatives lagging approximately 10 points behind. We find generation tasks more challenging than conversion tasks, and producing correct visual content more difficult than generating text-only structures.

Abstract: Benefiting from contrastively trained visual encoders on large-scale natural scene images, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various visual perception tasks. However, the inherent limitations of contrastive learning upon summarized descriptions fundamentally restrict the capabilities of models in meticulous reasoning, particularly in crucial scenarios of geometric problem-solving. To enhance geometric understanding, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code, and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on caption similarity. We train CLIP using our strong negative learning method, namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM, significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models like GPT-4o. We further study the impact of different negative sample construction methods and the number of negative samples on the geometric reasoning performance of LMM, yielding fruitful conclusions. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/MMGeoLM.

<title>Prismatic Synthesis: Gradient-based Data Diversification Boosts Generalization in LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Effective generalization in language models depends critically on the diversity of their training data. Yet existing diversity metrics often fall short of this goal, relying on surface-level heuristics that are decoupled from model behavior. This motivates us to ask: What kind of diversity in training data actually drives generalization in language models -- and how can we measure and amplify it? Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over 300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show that data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM reasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen out-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies diversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients. Despite using a small off-the-shelf proxy model for gradients, G-Vendi consistently outperforms alternative measures, achieving strong correlation (Spearman's $\rho \approx 0.9$) with out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on both natural language inference (NLI) and math reasoning tasks. Building on this insight, we present Prismatic Synthesis, a framework for generating diverse synthetic data by targeting underrepresented regions in gradient space. Experimental results show that Prismatic Synthesis consistently improves model performance as we scale synthetic data -- not just on in-distribution test but across unseen, out-of-distribution benchmarks -- significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models that rely on 20 times larger data generator than ours. For example, PrismMath-7B, our model distilled from a 32B LLM, outperforms R1-Distill-Qwen-7B -- the same base model trained on proprietary data generated by 671B R1 -- on 6 out of 7 challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where important textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about their reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making the process resource-intensive. To address these issues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose caption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed to improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We further extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains the differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that describes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding, reasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to the development of ALLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly history, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of 27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online search and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%) and Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These results highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and demonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.

<title>Learning Extrapolative Sequence Transformations from Markov Chains</title>

Abstract: Most successful applications of deep learning involve similar training and test conditions. However, tasks such as biological sequence design involve searching for sequences that improve desirable properties beyond previously known values, which requires novel hypotheses that \emph{extrapolate} beyond training data. In these settings, extrapolation may be achieved by using random search methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which, given an initial state, sample local transformations to approximate a target density that rewards states with the desired properties. However, even with a well-designed proposal, MCMC may struggle to explore large structured state spaces efficiently. Rather than relying on stochastic search, it would be desirable to have a model that greedily optimizes the properties of interest, successfully extrapolating in as few steps as possible. We propose to learn such a model from the Markov chains resulting from MCMC search. Specifically, our approach uses selected states from Markov chains as a source of training data for an autoregressive model, which is then able to efficiently generate novel sequences that extrapolate along the sequence-level properties of interest. The proposed approach is validated on three problems: protein sequence design, text sentiment control, and text anonymization. We find that the autoregressive model can extrapolate as well or better than MCMC, but with the additional benefits of scalability and significantly higher sample efficiency.

<title>Position: Mechanistic Interpretability Should Prioritize Feature Consistency in SAEs</title>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are a prominent tool in mechanistic interpretability (MI) for decomposing neural network activations into interpretable features. However, the aspiration to identify a canonical set of features is challenged by the observed inconsistency of learned SAE features across different training runs, undermining the reliability and efficiency of MI research. This position paper argues that mechanistic interpretability should prioritize feature consistency in SAEs -- the reliable convergence to equivalent feature sets across independent runs. We propose using the Pairwise Dictionary Mean Correlation Coefficient (PW-MCC) as a practical metric to operationalize consistency and demonstrate that high levels are achievable (0.80 for TopK SAEs on LLM activations) with appropriate architectural choices. Our contributions include detailing the benefits of prioritizing consistency; providing theoretical grounding and synthetic validation using a model organism, which verifies PW-MCC as a reliable proxy for ground-truth recovery; and extending these findings to real-world LLM data, where high feature consistency strongly correlates with the semantic similarity of learned feature explanations. We call for a community-wide shift towards systematically measuring feature consistency to foster robust cumulative progress in MI.

Abstract: LLMs have made impressive progress, but their growing capabilities also expose them to highly flexible jailbreaking attacks designed to bypass safety alignment. While many existing defenses focus on known types of attacks, it is more critical to prepare LLMs for unseen attacks that may arise during deployment. To address this, we propose a lifelong safety alignment framework that enables LLMs to continuously adapt to new and evolving jailbreaking strategies. Our framework introduces a competitive setup between two components: a Meta-Attacker, trained to actively discover novel jailbreaking strategies, and a Defender, trained to resist them. To effectively warm up the Meta-Attacker, we first leverage the GPT-4o API to extract key insights from a large collection of jailbreak-related research papers. Through iterative training, the first iteration Meta-Attacker achieves a 73% attack success rate (ASR) on RR and a 57% transfer ASR on LAT using only single-turn attacks. Meanwhile, the Defender progressively improves its robustness and ultimately reduces the Meta-Attacker's success rate to just 7%, enabling safer and more reliable deployment of LLMs in open-ended environments. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/LifelongSafetyAlignment.

<title>The Coverage Principle: A Framework for Understanding Compositional Generalization</title>

Abstract: Large language models excel at pattern matching, yet often fall short in systematic compositional generalization. We propose the coverage principle: a data-centric framework showing that models relying primarily on pattern matching for compositional tasks cannot reliably generalize beyond substituting fragments that yield identical results when used in the same contexts. We demonstrate that this framework has a strong predictive power for the generalization capabilities of Transformers. First, we derive and empirically confirm that the training data required for two-hop generalization grows at least quadratically with the token set size, and the training data efficiency does not improve with 20x parameter scaling. Second, for compositional tasks with path ambiguity where one variable affects the output through multiple computational paths, we show that Transformers learn context-dependent state representations that undermine both performance and interoperability. Third, Chain-of-Thought supervision improves training data efficiency for multi-hop tasks but still struggles with path ambiguity. Finally, we outline a \emph{mechanism-based} taxonomy that distinguishes three ways neural networks can generalize: structure-based (bounded by coverage), property-based (leveraging algebraic invariances), and shared-operator (through function reuse). This conceptual lens contextualizes our results and highlights where new architectural ideas are needed to achieve systematic compositionally. Overall, the coverage principle provides a unified lens for understanding compositional reasoning, and underscores the need for fundamental architectural or training innovations to achieve truly systematic compositionality.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and videos has motivated extending these models to understand 3D scenes, aiming for human-like visual-spatial intelligence. Nevertheless, achieving deep spatial understanding comparable to human capabilities poses significant challenges in model encoding and data acquisition. Existing methods frequently depend on external depth sensors for geometry capture or utilize off-the-shelf algorithms for pre-constructing 3D maps, thereby limiting their scalability, especially with prevalent monocular video inputs and for time-sensitive applications. In this work, we introduce VLM-3R, a unified framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that incorporates 3D Reconstructive instruction tuning. VLM-3R processes monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D tokens that represent spatial understanding. Leveraging our Spatial-Visual-View Fusion and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning question-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial context with language instructions. This enables monocular 3D spatial assistance and embodied reasoning. To facilitate the evaluation of temporal reasoning, we introduce the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence benchmark, featuring over 138.6K QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving spatial relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, VLM-3R, not only facilitates robust visual-spatial reasoning but also enables the understanding of temporal 3D context changes, excelling in both accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: We propose Visualize-then-Retrieve (VisRet), a new paradigm for Text-to-Image (T2I) retrieval that mitigates the limitations of cross-modal similarity alignment of existing multi-modal embeddings. VisRet first projects textual queries into the image modality via T2I generation. Then, it performs retrieval within the image modality to bypass the weaknesses of cross-modal retrievers in recognizing subtle visual-spatial features. Experiments on three knowledge-intensive T2I retrieval benchmarks, including a newly introduced multi-entity benchmark, demonstrate that VisRet consistently improves T2I retrieval by 24.5% to 32.7% NDCG@10 across different embedding models. VisRet also significantly benefits downstream visual question answering accuracy when used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines. The method is plug-and-play and compatible with off-the-shelf retrievers, making it an effective module for knowledge-intensive multi-modal systems. Our code and the new benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/xiaowu0162/Visualize-then-Retrieve.

<title>DiSA: Diffusion Step Annealing in Autoregressive Image Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: An increasing number of autoregressive models, such as MAR, FlowAR, xAR, and Harmon adopt diffusion sampling to improve the quality of image generation. However, this strategy leads to low inference efficiency, because it usually takes 50 to 100 steps for diffusion to sample a token. This paper explores how to effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens are generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more constrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if a model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog and thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at later generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer perceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising paths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step annealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion steps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and gradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from our finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary to existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be implemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple, achieves $5-10\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\times$ for FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in technology have led to a boost in social media usage which has ultimately led to large amounts of user-generated data which also includes hateful and offensive speech. The language used in social media is often a combination of English and the native language in the region. In India, Hindi is used predominantly and is often code-switched with English, giving rise to the Hinglish (Hindi+English) language. Various approaches have been made in the past to classify the code-mixed Hinglish hate speech using different machine learning and deep learning-based techniques. However, these techniques make use of recurrence on convolution mechanisms which are computationally expensive and have high memory requirements. Past techniques also make use of complex data processing making the existing techniques very complex and non-sustainable to change in data. Proposed work gives a much simpler approach which is not only at par with these complex networks but also exceeds performance with the use of subword tokenization algorithms like BPE and Unigram, along with multi-head attention-based techniques, giving an accuracy of 87.41% and an F1 score of 0.851 on standard datasets. Efficient use of BPE and Unigram algorithms help handle the nonconventional Hinglish vocabulary making the proposed technique simple, efficient and sustainable to use in the real world.

Abstract: Several works have proven that finetuning is an applicable approach for debiasing contextualized word embeddings. Similarly, discrete prompts with semantic meanings have shown to be effective in debiasing tasks. With unfixed mathematical representation at the token level, continuous prompts usually surpass discrete ones at providing a pre-trained language model (PLM) with additional task-specific information. Despite this, relatively few efforts have been made to debias PLMs by prompt tuning with continuous prompts compared to its discrete counterpart. Furthermore, for most debiasing methods that alter a PLM's original parameters, a major problem is the need to not only decrease the bias in the PLM but also to ensure that the PLM does not lose its representation ability. Finetuning methods typically have a hard time maintaining this balance, as they tend to violently remove meanings of attribute words. In this paper, we propose ADEPT, a method to debias PLMs using prompt tuning while maintaining the delicate balance between removing biases and ensuring representation ability. To achieve this, we propose a new training criterion inspired by manifold learning and equip it with an explicit debiasing term to optimize prompt tuning. In addition, we conduct several experiments with regard to the reliability, quality, and quantity of a previously proposed attribute training corpus in order to obtain a clearer prototype of a certain attribute, which indicates the attribute's position and relative distances to other words on the manifold. We evaluate ADEPT on several widely acknowledged debiasing benchmarks and downstream tasks, and find that it achieves competitive results while maintaining (and in some cases even improving) the PLM's representation ability. We further visualize words' correlation before and after debiasing a PLM, and give some possible explanations for the visible effects.

<title>The More Similar, the Better? Associations between Latent Semantic Similarity and Emotional Experiences Differ across Conversation Contexts</title>

Abstract: Latent semantic similarity (LSS) is a measure of the similarity of information exchanges in a conversation. Challenging the assumption that higher LSS bears more positive psychological meaning, we propose that this association might depend on the type of conversation people have. On the one hand, the share-mind perspective would predict that higher LSS should be associated with more positive emotional experiences across the board. The broaden-and-build theory, on the other hand, would predict that higher LSS should be inversely associated with more positive emotional experiences specifically in pleasant conversations. Linear mixed modeling based on conversations among 50 long-term married couples supported the latter prediction. That is, partners experienced greater positive emotions when their overall information exchanges were more dissimilar in pleasant (but not conflict) conversations. This work highlights the importance of context in understanding the emotional correlates of LSS and exemplifies how modern natural language processing tools can be used to evaluate competing theory-driven hypotheses in social psychology.

Abstract: Over the past few years, various domain-specific pretrained language models (PLMs) have been proposed and have outperformed general-domain PLMs in specialized areas such as biomedical, scientific, and clinical domains. In addition, financial PLMs have been studied because of the high economic impact of financial data analysis. However, we found that financial PLMs were not pretrained on sufficiently diverse financial data. This lack of diverse training data leads to a subpar generalization performance, resulting in general-purpose PLMs, including BERT, often outperforming financial PLMs on many downstream tasks. To address this issue, we collected a broad range of financial corpus and trained the Financial Language Model (FiLM) on these diverse datasets. Our experimental results confirm that FiLM outperforms not only existing financial PLMs but also general domain PLMs. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that this improvement can be achieved even for unseen corpus groups.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in various tasks, however, there remains a significant lack of open-source models and data for specific domains. Previous work has primarily focused on manually specifying resources and collecting high-quality data for specific domains, which is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this limitation, we introduce large models into the data collection pipeline to guide the generation of domain-specific information and retrieve relevant data from Common Crawl (CC), a large public corpus. We refer to this approach as Retrieve-from-CC. It not only collects data related to domain-specific knowledge but also mines the data containing potential reasoning procedures from the public corpus. By applying this method, we have collected a knowledge domain-related dataset named Retrieve-Pile, which covers four main domains, including the sciences, humanities, and other categories. Through the analysis of , Retrieve-from-CC can effectively retrieve relevant data from the covered knowledge domains and significantly improve the performance in tests of mathematical and knowledge-related reasoning abilities. We have released Retrieve-Pile at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Query-of-CC/Retrieve-Pile.

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) is a task aimed at alleviating individuals' emotional distress through daily conversation. Given its inherent complexity and non-intuitive nature, ESConv dataset incorporates support strategies to facilitate the generation of appropriate responses. Recently, despite the remarkable conversational ability of large language models (LLMs), previous studies have suggested that they often struggle with providing useful emotional support. Hence, this work initially analyzes the results of LLMs on ESConv, revealing challenges in selecting the correct strategy and a notable preference for a specific strategy. Motivated by these, we explore the impact of the inherent preference in LLMs on providing emotional support, and consequently, we observe that exhibiting high preference for specific strategies hinders effective emotional support, aggravating its robustness in predicting the appropriate strategy. Moreover, we conduct a methodological study to offer insights into the necessary approaches for LLMs to serve as proficient emotional supporters. Our findings emphasize that (1) low preference for specific strategies hinders the progress of emotional support, (2) external assistance helps reduce preference bias, and (3) existing LLMs alone cannot become good emotional supporters. These insights suggest promising avenues for future research to enhance the emotional intelligence of LLMs.

Abstract: Entity set expansion, taxonomy expansion, and seed-guided taxonomy construction are three representative tasks that can be applied to automatically populate an existing taxonomy with emerging concepts. Previous studies view them as three separate tasks. Therefore, their proposed techniques usually work for one specific task only, lacking generalizability and a holistic perspective. In this paper, we aim at a unified solution to the three tasks. To be specific, we identify two common skills needed for entity set expansion, taxonomy expansion, and seed-guided taxonomy construction: finding "siblings" and finding "parents". We propose a taxonomy-guided instruction tuning framework to teach a large language model to generate siblings and parents for query entities, where the joint pre-training process facilitates the mutual enhancement of the two skills. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed TaxoInstruct framework, which outperforms task-specific baselines across all three tasks.

Abstract: The tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate hallucinations raises concerns regarding their reliability. Therefore, confidence estimations indicating the extent of trustworthiness of the generations become essential. However, current LLM confidence estimations in languages other than English remain underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive investigation of Multilingual Confidence estimation (MlingConf) on LLMs, focusing on both language-agnostic (LA) and language-specific (LS) tasks to explore the performance and language dominance effects of multilingual confidence estimations on different tasks. The benchmark comprises four meticulously checked and human-evaluated high-quality multilingual datasets for LA tasks and one for the LS task tailored to specific social, cultural, and geographical contexts of a language. Our experiments reveal that on LA tasks English exhibits notable linguistic dominance in confidence estimations than other languages, while on LS tasks, using question-related language to prompt LLMs demonstrates better linguistic dominance in multilingual confidence estimations. The phenomena inspire a simple yet effective native-tone prompting strategy by employing language-specific prompts for LS tasks, effectively improving LLMs' reliability and accuracy in LS scenarios.

<title>Bias and Volatility: A Statistical Framework for Evaluating Large Language Model's Stereotypes and the Associated Generation Inconsistency</title>

Abstract: We present a novel statistical framework for analyzing stereotypes in large language models (LLMs) by systematically estimating the bias and variation in their generation. Current alignment evaluation metrics often overlook stereotypes' randomness caused by LLMs' inconsistent generative behavior. For instance, LLMs may display contradictory stereotypes, such as those related to gender or race, for identical professions in different contexts. Ignoring this inconsistency risks misleading conclusions in alignment assessments and undermines efforts to evaluate the potential of LLMs to perpetuate or amplify social biases and unfairness.
  To address this, we propose the Bias-Volatility Framework (BVF), which estimates the probability distribution of stereotypes in LLM outputs. By capturing the variation in generative behavior, BVF assesses both the likelihood and degree to which LLM outputs negatively impact vulnerable groups, enabling a quantification of aggregated discrimination risk. Additionally, we introduce a mathematical framework to decompose this risk into bias risk (from the mean of the stereotype distribution) and volatility risk (from its variation). Applying BVF to 12 widely used LLMs, we find: i) Bias risk is the dominant contributor to discrimination; ii) Most LLMs exhibit substantial pro-male stereotypes across nearly all professions; iii) Reinforcement learning from human feedback reduces bias but increases volatility; iv) Discrimination risk correlates with socio-economic factors, such as professional salaries. Finally, we highlight BVF's broader applicability for assessing how generation inconsistencies in LLMs impact behavior beyond stereotypes.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a popular method for tailoring pre-trained large language models (LLMs), especially as the models' scale and the diversity of tasks increase. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is based on the idea that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional, i.e., significant model changes can be represented with relatively few parameters. However, decreasing the rank encounters challenges with generalization errors for specific tasks when compared to full-parameter fine-tuning. We present MELoRA, a mini-ensemble low-rank adapters that uses fewer trainable parameters while maintaining a higher rank, thereby offering improved performance potential. The core idea is to freeze original pretrained weights and train a group of mini LoRAs with only a small number of parameters. This can capture a significant degree of diversity among mini LoRAs, thus promoting better generalization ability. We conduct a theoretical analysis and empirical studies on various NLP tasks. Our experimental results show that, compared to LoRA, MELoRA achieves better performance with 8 times fewer trainable parameters on natural language understanding tasks and 36 times fewer trainable parameters on instruction following tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of MELoRA.

Abstract: Scientific language models drive research innovation but require extensive fine-tuning on large datasets. This work enhances such models by improving their inference and evaluation capabilities with minimal or no additional training. Focusing on molecule caption generation, we explore post-training synergies between alignment fine-tuning and model merging in a cross-modal setup. We reveal intriguing insights into the behaviour and suitability of such methods while significantly surpassing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we propose a novel atomic-level evaluation method leveraging off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) models for use in the unseen chemical domain. Our experiments demonstrate that our evaluation operates at the right level of granularity, effectively handling multiple content units and subsentence reasoning, while widely adopted NLI methods consistently misalign with assessment criteria.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enhances the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by prepending a few demonstrations. It motivates researchers to introduce more examples to provide additional contextual information for the generation. However, existing methods show a significant limitation due to the problem of excessive growth in context length, which causes a large hardware burden. In addition, shallow-relevant examples selected by off-the-shelf tools hinder LLMs from capturing useful contextual information for generation. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UniICL}, a novel \textbf{Uni}fied \textbf{ICL} framework that unifies demonstration compression, demonstration selection, and final response generation. Furthermore, to boost inference efficiency, we design a tailored compression strategy that allows UniICL to cache compression results into \textbf{Demonstration Bank} (\textbf{DB}), which avoids repeated compression of the same demonstration. Extensive out-of-domain evaluations prove the advantages of UniICL in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: We explore the ability of GPT-4 to perform ad-hoc schema based information extraction from scientific literature. We assess specifically whether it can, with a basic prompting approach, replicate two existing material science datasets, given the manuscripts from which they were originally manually extracted. We employ materials scientists to perform a detailed manual error analysis to assess where the model struggles to faithfully extract the desired information, and draw on their insights to suggest research directions to address this broadly important task.

Abstract: Maximum a posteriori decoding, a commonly used method for neural machine translation (NMT), aims to maximize the estimated posterior probability. However, high estimated probability does not always lead to high translation quality. Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding offers an alternative by seeking hypotheses with the highest expected utility.
  Inspired by Quality Estimation (QE) reranking which uses the QE model as a ranker we propose source-based MBR (sMBR) decoding, a novel approach that utilizes quasi-sources (generated via paraphrasing or back-translation) as ``support hypotheses'' and a reference-free quality estimation metric as the utility function, marking the first work to solely use sources in MBR decoding. Experiments show that sMBR outperforms QE reranking and the standard MBR decoding. Our findings suggest that sMBR is a promising approach for NMT decoding.

Abstract: Analyzing user opinion changes in long conversation threads is extremely critical for applications like enhanced personalization, market research, political campaigns, customer service, targeted advertising, and content moderation. Unfortunately, previous studies on stance and dogmatism in user conversations have focused on training models using datasets annotated at the post level, treating each post as independent and randomly sampling posts from conversation threads. Hence, first, we build a dataset for studying user opinion fluctuations in 764 long multi-user Reddit conversation threads, called USDC. USDC contains annotations for 2 tasks: i) User Stance classification, which involves labeling a user's stance in a post within a conversation on a five-point scale; ii) User Dogmatism classification, which involves labeling a user's overall opinion in the conversation on a four-point scale. Besides being time-consuming and costly, manual annotations for USDC are challenging because: 1) Conversation threads could be very long, increasing the chances of noisy annotations; and 2) Interpreting instances where a user changes their opinion within a conversation is difficult because often such transitions are subtle and not expressed explicitly. Hence, we leverage majority voting on zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot annotations from Mistral Large and GPT-4 to automate the annotation process. Human annotations on 200 test conversations achieved inter-annotator agreement scores of 0.49 for stance and 0.50 for dogmatism with these LLM annotations, indicating a reasonable level of consistency between human and LLM annotations. USDC is then used to finetune and instruction-tune multiple deployable small language models like LLaMA, Falcon and Vicuna for the stance and dogmatism classification tasks. We make the code and dataset publicly available [https://github.com/mounikamarreddy/USDC].

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance across various text generation tasks but remain under-explored in the patent domain, which offers highly structured and precise language. This paper constructs a dataset to investigate the performance of current LLMs in patent claim generation. Our results demonstrate that generating claims based on patent descriptions outperforms previous research relying on abstracts. Interestingly, current patent-specific LLMs perform much worse than state-of-the-art general LLMs, highlighting the necessity for future research on in-domain LLMs. We also find that LLMs can produce high-quality first independent claims, but their performances markedly decrease for subsequent dependent claims. Moreover, fine-tuning can enhance the completeness of inventions' features, conceptual clarity, and feature linkage. Among the tested LLMs, GPT-4 demonstrates the best performance in comprehensive human evaluations by patent experts, with better feature coverage, conceptual clarity, and technical coherence. Despite these capabilities, comprehensive revision and modification are still necessary to pass rigorous patent scrutiny and ensure legal robustness.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) poses significant challenges due to the domain gap and limited data availability. This study investigates the effectiveness of various adapter techniques, equivalent to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for fine-tuning LLMs in a resource-constrained hospital environment. We experimented with four structures-Adapter, Lightweight, TinyAttention, and Gated Residual Network (GRN)-as final layers for clinical notes classification. We fine-tuned biomedical pre-trained models, including CamemBERT-bio, AliBERT, and DrBERT, alongside two Transformer-based models. Our extensive experimental results indicate that i) employing adapter structures does not yield significant improvements in fine-tuning biomedical pre-trained LLMs, and ii) simpler Transformer-based models, trained from scratch, perform better under resource constraints. Among the adapter structures, GRN demonstrated superior performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and an F1 score of 0.88. Moreover, the total training time for LLMs exceeded 1000 hours, compared to under 6 hours for simpler transformer-based models, highlighting that LLMs are more suitable for environments with extensive computational resources and larger datasets. Consequently, this study demonstrates that simpler Transformer-based models can be effectively trained from scratch, providing a viable solution for clinical NLP tasks in low-resource environments with limited data availability. By identifying the GRN as the most effective adapter structure, we offer a practical approach to enhance clinical note classification without requiring extensive computational resources.

Abstract: Massive parameters of LLMs have made inference latency a fundamental bottleneck. Speculative decoding represents a lossless approach to accelerate inference through a guess-and-verify paradigm. Some methods rely on additional architectures to guess draft tokens, which need extra training before use. Alternatively, retrieval-based training-free techniques build libraries from pre-existing corpora or by n-gram generation. However, they face challenges like large storage requirements, time-consuming retrieval, and limited adaptability. Observing that candidate tokens generated during the decoding process are likely to reoccur in future sequences, we propose Token Recycling. It stores candidate tokens in an adjacency matrix and employs a breadth-first-search (BFS)-like algorithm to construct a draft tree, which is then validated through tree attention. New candidate tokens from the decoding process are then used to update the matrix. Token Recycling requires \textless2MB of additional storage and achieves approximately 2x speedup across all sizes of LLMs. It significantly outperforms existing train-free methods by 30\% and even a widely recognized training method by 25\%.

Abstract: Taxonomies play a crucial role in various applications by providing a structural representation of knowledge. The task of taxonomy expansion involves integrating emerging concepts into existing taxonomies by identifying appropriate parent concepts for these new query concepts. Previous approaches typically relied on self-supervised methods that generate annotation data from existing taxonomies. However, these methods are less effective when the existing taxonomy is small (fewer than 100 entities). In this work, we introduce CodeTaxo, a novel approach that leverages large language models through code language prompts to capture the taxonomic structure. Extensive experiments on five real-world benchmarks from different domains demonstrate that CodeTaxo consistently achieves superior performance across all evaluation metrics, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The code and data are available at https://github.com/QingkaiZeng/CodeTaxo-Pub.

Abstract: The zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) approach is often used in question answering (QA) by language models (LMs) for tasks that require multiple reasoning steps. However, some QA tasks hinge more on accessing relevant knowledge than on chaining reasoning steps. We introduce a simple prompting technique, called PREP, that involves using two instances of LMs: the first (LM1) generates relevant information, and the second (LM2) receives the information from the user and answers the question. This design is intended to make better use of the LM's instruction-following capability. PREP is applicable across various QA tasks without domain-specific prompt engineering. PREP is developed on a dataset of 100 QA questions, derived from an extensive schematic dataset specifying artifact parts and material composition. These questions ask which of two artifacts is less likely to share materials with another artifact. Such questions probe the LM's knowledge of shared materials in the part structure of different artifacts. We test our method on our parts-and-materials dataset and three published commonsense reasoning datasets. The average accuracy of our method is consistently higher than that of all the other tested methods across all the tested datasets.

Abstract: We introduce the Faetar Automatic Speech Recognition Benchmark, a benchmark corpus designed to push the limits of current approaches to low-resource speech recognition. Faetar, a Franco-Proven\c{c}al variety spoken primarily in Italy, has no standard orthography, has virtually no existing textual or speech resources other than what is included in the benchmark, and is quite different from other forms of Franco-Proven\c{c}al. The corpus comes from field recordings, most of which are noisy, for which only 5 hrs have matching transcriptions, and for which forced alignment is of variable quality. The corpus contains an additional 20 hrs of unlabelled speech. We report baseline results from state-of-the-art multilingual speech foundation models with a best phone error rate of 30.4%, using a pipeline that continues pre-training on the foundation model using the unlabelled set.

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient technique for updating the knowledge of large language models (LLMs), attracting increasing attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of effective measures to prevent the malicious misuse of this technique, which could lead to harmful edits in LLMs. These malicious modifications could cause LLMs to generate toxic content, misleading users into inappropriate actions. In front of this risk, we introduce a new task, $\textbf{K}$nowledge $\textbf{E}$diting $\textbf{T}$ype $\textbf{I}$dentification (KETI), aimed at identifying different types of edits in LLMs, thereby providing timely alerts to users when encountering illicit edits. As part of this task, we propose KETIBench, which includes five types of harmful edits covering the most popular toxic types, as well as one benign factual edit. We develop five classical classification models and three BERT-based models as baseline identifiers for both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Our experimental results, across 92 trials involving four models and three knowledge editing methods, demonstrate that all eight baseline identifiers achieve decent identification performance, highlighting the feasibility of identifying malicious edits in LLMs. Additional analyses reveal that the performance of the identifiers is independent of the reliability of the knowledge editing methods and exhibits cross-domain generalization, enabling the identification of edits from unknown sources. All data and code are available in https://github.com/xpq-tech/KETI.

However, the inherent gap between user queries and relevant documents hinders precise matching. We introduce QAEncoder, a training-free approach to bridge this gap. Specifically, QAEncoder estimates the expectation of potential queries in the embedding space as a robust surrogate for the document embedding, and attaches document fingerprints to effectively distinguish these embeddings. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, languages, and embedding models confirmed QAEncoder's alignment capability, which offers a simple-yet-effective solution with zero additional index storage, retrieval latency, training costs, or catastrophic forgetting and hallucination issues.

Abstract: Visual language is a system of communication that conveys information through symbols, shapes, and spatial arrangements. Diagrams are a typical example of a visual language depicting complex concepts and their relationships in the form of an image. The symbolic nature of diagrams presents significant challenges for building models capable of understanding them. Recent studies suggest that Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can even tackle complex reasoning tasks involving diagrams. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by developing a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the diagram comprehension capability of LVLMs. Our test suite uses a variety of questions focused on concept entities and their relationships over a set of synthetic as well as real diagrams across domains to evaluate the recognition and reasoning abilities of models. Our evaluation of LVLMs shows that while they can accurately identify and reason about entities, their ability to understand relationships is notably limited. Further testing reveals that the decent performance on diagram understanding largely stems from leveraging their background knowledge as shortcuts to identify and reason about the relational information. Thus, we conclude that LVLMs have a limited capability for genuine diagram understanding, and their impressive performance in diagram reasoning is an illusion emanating from other confounding factors, such as the background knowledge in the models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success across diverse tasks, and fine-tuning is sometimes needed to further enhance generation quality. Most existing methods rely on human supervision or parameter retraining, both of which are costly in terms of data collection and computational resources. To handle these challenges, a direct solution is to generate ``high-confidence'' data from unsupervised downstream tasks and use them for in-context prompting or prompt optimization to refine the pseudo-supervision. However, relying solely on such data may lead to overfitting. In this paper, we leverage the in-context learning (ICL) abilities of LLMs and propose a novel approach, pseudo-supervised demonstrations aligned prompt optimization (PAPO) algorithm, which jointly refines both the prompt and the overall pseudo-supervision. The proposed learning objective ensures that the optimized prompt guides the LLM to generate consistent responses for a given input when pseudo-supervised data from the downstream task are used as demonstrations, enabling refinement over the entire pseudo-supervision. The prompt is optimized by translating gradient signals into textual critiques, which serve as feedback to iteratively refine the prompt and model responses. Theoretical analysis in a simplified classification setting shows that the refined pseudo-supervision exhibits a geometric clustering structure, helping to mitigate overfitting. Experiments on question answering, natural language inference benchmarks, and a real-world molecule optimization task, show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: As global demand for multilingual large language models (LLMs) grows, most LLMs still remain overly focused on English, leading to the limited access to advanced AI for non-English speakers. Current methods to enhance multilingual capabilities largely rely on data-driven post-training techniques, such as multilingual instruction tuning or continual pre-training. However, these approaches exhibit significant limitations, including high resource cost, exacerbation of off-target issue and catastrophic forgetting of central language abilities. To this end, we propose Lens, a novel approach that enhances multilingual capabilities by leveraging LLMs' internal language representation spaces. Lens operates on two subspaces: the language-agnostic subspace, where it aligns target languages with the central language to inherit strong semantic representations, and the language-specific subspace, where it separates target and central languages to preserve linguistic specificity. Experiments on three English-centric LLMs show that Lens significantly improves multilingual performance while maintaining the model's English proficiency, achieving better results with less computational cost compared to existing post-training approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce PII-Scope, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art methodologies for PII extraction attacks targeting LLMs across diverse threat settings. Our study provides a deeper understanding of these attacks by uncovering several hyperparameters (e.g., demonstration selection) crucial to their effectiveness. Building on this understanding, we extend our study to more realistic attack scenarios, exploring PII attacks that employ advanced adversarial strategies, including repeated and diverse querying, and leveraging iterative learning for continual PII extraction. Through extensive experimentation, our results reveal a notable underestimation of PII leakage in existing single-query attacks. In fact, we show that with sophisticated adversarial capabilities and a limited query budget, PII extraction rates can increase by up to fivefold when targeting the pretrained model. Moreover, we evaluate PII leakage on finetuned models, showing that they are more vulnerable to leakage than pretrained models. Overall, our work establishes a rigorous empirical benchmark for PII extraction attacks in realistic threat scenarios and provides a strong foundation for developing effective mitigation strategies.

However, this approach can cause information interference, where different token data conflicts, resulting in performance degradation and incoherent outputs beyond a certain context length. To prevent this, most RNNs incorporate mechanisms designed to "forget" earlier tokens. In this paper, we reveal that Mamba-based models struggle to effectively forget earlier tokens even with built-in forgetting mechanisms. We demonstrate that this issue stems from training on contexts that are too short for the state size, enabling the model to perform well without needing to learn how to forget. Then, we show that the minimum training length required for the model to learn forgetting scales linearly with the state size, and the maximum context length for accurate retrieval of a 5-digit passkey scales exponentially with the state size, indicating that the model retains some information beyond the point where forgetting begins. These findings highlight a critical limitation in current RNN architectures and provide valuable insights for improving long-context modeling. Our work suggests that future RNN designs must account for the interplay between state size, training length, and forgetting mechanisms to achieve robust performance in long-context tasks.

Abstract: Safety concerns in large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their exposure to potentially harmful data during pre-training. In this paper, we identify a new safety vulnerability in LLMs: their susceptibility to \textit{natural distribution shifts} between attack prompts and original toxic prompts, where seemingly benign prompts, semantically related to harmful content, can bypass safety mechanisms. To explore this issue, we introduce a novel attack method, \textit{ActorBreaker}, which identifies actors related to toxic prompts within pre-training distribution to craft multi-turn prompts that gradually lead LLMs to reveal unsafe content. ActorBreaker is grounded in Latour's actor-network theory, encompassing both human and non-human actors to capture a broader range of vulnerabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that ActorBreaker outperforms existing attack methods in terms of diversity, effectiveness, and efficiency across aligned LLMs. To address this vulnerability, we propose expanding safety training to cover a broader semantic space of toxic content. We thus construct a multi-turn safety dataset using ActorBreaker. Fine-tuning models on our dataset shows significant improvements in robustness, though with some trade-offs in utility. Code is available at https://github.com/AI45Lab/ActorAttack.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in reasoning tasks but face limitations in mathematical and complex logical reasoning. Existing methods to improve LLMs' logical capabilities either involve traceable or verifiable logical sequences that generate more reliable responses by constructing logical structures yet increase computational costs, or introduces rigid logic template rules, reducing flexibility. In this paper, we propose Reversal of Thought (RoT), a plug-and-play and cost-effective reasoning framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs during the warm-up phase prior to batch inference. RoT utilizes a Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning warm-up strategy, which integrates logical symbols for pseudocode planning through meta-cognitive mechanisms and pairwise preference self-evaluation to generate task-specific prompts solely through demonstrations, aligning with LLMs' cognitive preferences shaped by RLHF. Through reverse reasoning, we utilize a Cognitive Preference Manager to assess knowledge boundaries and further expand LLMs' reasoning capabilities by aggregating solution logic for known tasks and stylistic templates for unknown tasks. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that RoT surpasses existing baselines in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: The conformity effect describes the tendency of individuals to align their responses with the majority. Studying this bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, as LLMs are increasingly used in various information-seeking and decision-making tasks as conversation partners to improve productivity. Thus, conformity to incorrect responses can compromise their effectiveness. In this paper, we adapt psychological experiments to examine the extent of conformity in popular LLMs. Our findings reveal that all tested models exhibit varying levels of conformity toward the majority, regardless of their initial choice or correctness, across different knowledge domains. Notably, we are the first to show that LLMs are more likely to conform when they are more uncertain in their own prediction. We further explore factors that influence conformity, such as training paradigms and input characteristics, finding that instruction-tuned models are less susceptible to conformity, while increasing the naturalness of majority tones amplifies conformity. Finally, we propose two interventions, Devil's Advocate and Question Distillation, to mitigate conformity, providing insights into building more robust language models.

Abstract: Existing retrieval methods in Large Language Models show degradation in accuracy when handling temporally distributed conversations, primarily due to their reliance on simple similarity-based retrieval. Unlike existing memory retrieval methods that rely solely on semantic similarity, we propose SynapticRAG, which uniquely combines temporal association triggers with biologically-inspired synaptic propagation mechanisms. Our approach uses temporal association triggers and synaptic-like stimulus propagation to identify relevant dialogue histories. A dynamic leaky integrate-and-fire mechanism then selects the most contextually appropriate memories. Experiments on four datasets of English, Chinese and Japanese show that compared to state-of-the-art memory retrieval methods, SynapticRAG achieves consistent improvements across multiple metrics up to 14.66% points. This work bridges the gap between cognitive science and language model development, providing a new framework for memory management in conversational systems.

<title>RESTOR: Knowledge Recovery in Machine Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale corpora can memorize undesirable data containing misinformation, copyrighted material, or private or sensitive information. Recently, several machine unlearning algorithms have been proposed to eliminate the effect of such datapoints from trained models -- that is, to approximate a model that had never been trained on these datapoints in the first place. However, evaluating the effectiveness of unlearning algorithms remains an open challenge. Previous work has relied on heuristics -- such as verifying that the model can no longer reproduce the specific information targeted for removal while maintaining accuracy on unrelated test data. These approaches inadequately capture the complete effect of reversing the influence of datapoints on a trained model. In this work, we propose the RESTOR framework for machine unlearning evaluation, which assesses the ability of unlearning algorithms for targeted data erasure, by evaluating the ability of models to forget the knowledge introduced in these datapoints, while simultaneously recovering the model's knowledge state had it never encountered these datapoints. RESTOR helps uncover several novel insights about popular unlearning algorithms, and the mechanisms through which they operate -- for instance, identifying that some algorithms merely emphasize forgetting but not recovering knowledge, and that localizing unlearning targets can enhance unlearning performance.

<title>Regress, Don't Guess -- A Regression-like Loss on Number Tokens for Language Models</title>

Abstract: While language models have exceptional capabilities at text generation, they lack a natural inductive bias for emitting numbers and thus struggle in tasks involving quantitative reasoning, especially arithmetic. One fundamental limitation is the nature of the Cross Entropy loss, which assumes a nominal scale and thus cannot convey proximity between generated number tokens. In response, we here present a regression-like loss that operates purely on token level. Our proposed Number Token Loss (NTL) comes in two flavors and minimizes either the Lp norm or the Wasserstein distance between the numerical values of the real and predicted number tokens. NTL can easily be added to any language model and extend the Cross Entropy objective during training without runtime overhead. We evaluate the proposed scheme on various mathematical datasets and find that it consistently improves performance in math-related tasks. In a direct comparison on a regression task, we find that NTL can match the performance of a regression head, despite operating on token level. Finally, we scale NTL up to 3B parameter models and observe improved performance, demonstrating its potential for seamless integration into LLMs. We hope that this work can inspire LLM developers to improve their pretraining objectives.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large vision and language models (VLM) have demonstrated significant potential in completing daily computer tasks, such as browsing the web to book travel and operating desktop software, which requires agents to understand these interfaces. Despite such visual inputs becoming more integrated into agentic applications, what types of risks and attacks exist around them still remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that VLM agents can be easily attacked by a set of carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, which human users would typically recognize and ignore. This distraction leads agents to click these pop-ups instead of performing their tasks as usual. Integrating these pop-ups into existing agent testing environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena leads to an attack success rate (the frequency of the agent clicking the pop-ups) of 86% on average and decreases the task success rate by 47%. Basic defense techniques, such as asking the agent to ignore pop-ups or including an advertisement notice, are ineffective against the attack.

<title>Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation with Dynamic VQA Dataset and Self-adaptive Planning Agent</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (mRAG) plays an important role in mitigating the "hallucination" issue inherent in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although promising, existing heuristic mRAGs typically predefined fixed retrieval processes, which causes two issues: (1) Non-adaptive Retrieval Queries. (2) Overloaded Retrieval Queries. However, these flaws cannot be adequately reflected by current knowledge-seeking visual question answering (VQA) datasets, since the most required knowledge can be readily obtained with a standard two-step retrieval. To bridge the dataset gap, we first construct Dyn-VQA dataset, consisting of three types of "dynamic" questions, which require complex knowledge retrieval strategies variable in query, tool, and time: (1) Questions with rapidly changing answers. (2) Questions requiring multi-modal knowledge. (3) Multi-hop questions. Experiments on Dyn-VQA reveal that existing heuristic mRAGs struggle to provide sufficient and precisely relevant knowledge for dynamic questions due to their rigid retrieval processes. Hence, we further propose the first self-adaptive planning agent for multimodal retrieval, OmniSearch. The underlying idea is to emulate the human behavior in question solution which dynamically decomposes complex multimodal questions into sub-question chains with retrieval action. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of our OmniSearch, also provide direction for advancing mRAG. The code and dataset will be open-sourced at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/OmniSearch.

<title>Contextualized Evaluations: Judging Language Model Responses to Underspecified Queries</title>

Abstract: Language model users often issue queries that lack specification, where the context under which a query was issued -- such as the user's identity, the query's intent, and the criteria for a response to be useful -- is not explicit. For instance, a good response to a subjective query like "What book should I read next?" would depend on the user's preferences, and a good response to an open-ended query like "How do antibiotics work against bacteria?" would depend on the user's expertise. This makes evaluation of responses to such queries an ill-posed task, as evaluators may make arbitrary judgments about the response quality. To remedy this, we present contextualized evaluations, a protocol that synthetically constructs context surrounding an underspecified query and provides it during evaluation. We find that the presence of context can 1) alter conclusions drawn from evaluation, even flipping benchmark rankings between model pairs, 2) nudge evaluators to make fewer judgments based on surface-level criteria, like style, and 3) provide new insights about model behavior across diverse contexts. Specifically, our procedure suggests a potential bias towards WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) contexts in models' "default" responses and we find that models are not equally sensitive to following different contexts, even when they are provided in prompts.

Abstract: The advanced role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled rich interactive scenarios, yet existing research in social interactions neglects hallucination while struggling with poor generalizability and implicit character fidelity judgments. To bridge this gap, motivated by human behaviour, we introduce a generalizable and explicit paradigm for uncovering interactive patterns of LLMs across diverse worldviews. Specifically, we first define interactive hallucination through stance transfer, then construct SHARP, a benchmark built by extracting relations from commonsense knowledge graphs and utilizing LLMs' inherent hallucination properties to simulate multi-role interactions. Extensive experiments confirm our paradigm's effectiveness and stability, examine the factors that influence these metrics, and challenge conventional hallucination mitigation solutions. More broadly, our work reveals a fundamental limitation in popular post-training methods for role-playing LLMs: the tendency to obscure knowledge beneath style, resulting in monotonous yet human-like behaviors - interactive hallucination.

Abstract: In mid-20th century, the linguist Noam Chomsky established generative linguistics, and made significant contributions to linguistics, computer science, and cognitive science by developing the computational and philosophical foundations for a theory that defined language as a formal system, instantiated in human minds or artificial machines. These developments in turn ushered a wave of research on symbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI). More recently, a new wave of non-symbolic AI has emerged with neural Language Models (LMs) that exhibit impressive linguistic performance, leading many to question the older approach and wonder about the the compatibility of generative AI and generative linguistics. In this paper, we argue that generative AI is compatible with generative linguistics and reinforces its basic tenets in at least three ways. First, we argue that LMs are formal generative models as intended originally in Chomsky's work on formal language theory. Second, LMs can help develop a program for discovery procedures as defined by Chomsky's "Syntactic Structures". Third, LMs can be a major asset for Chomsky's minimalist approach to Universal Grammar and language acquisition. In turn, generative linguistics can provide the foundation for evaluating and improving LMs as well as other generative computational models of language.

<title>Is Training Data Quality or Quantity More Impactful to Small Language Model Performance?</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the relative impact of training data quality versus quantity on the performance of small language models (SLMs), utilizing the TinyStories dataset for empirical analysis. Analysis of dataset variations with respect to size (25% and 50% of the original size) and duplication (controlled rates of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) were performed. Model performance was evaluated based on the validation loss, accuracy, and perplexity metrics. Results indicate training data quality plays a more significant role in the overall performance of SLMs, especially given scale of this experiment. Minimal duplication positively impacted model accuracy (+0.87% increase in accuracy at 25% duplication) without significantly increasing perplexity (+0.52% increase going from 0% to 25% duplication) but excessive duplication led to pronounced performance degradation (-40% drop in accuracy at 100% duplication). The implications of this exploration extend beyond just model performance; training large-scale models imposes significant financial and computational burdens, which can be prohibitive for organizations, individuals, and the public at large, especially in developing countries. Additionally, the energy consumption associated with large-scale training raises environmental concerns. Understanding the relative importance of data quality versus quantity could democratize AI technology, making advanced models more accessible and sustainable for all.

Abstract: Tokenization methods like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) enhance computational efficiency in large language models (LLMs) but often obscure internal character structures within tokens. This limitation hinders LLMs' ability to predict precise character positions, which is crucial in tasks like Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) where identifying the positions of misspelled characters accelerates correction processes. We propose Token Internal Position Awareness (TIPA), a method that significantly improves models' ability to capture character positions within tokens by training them on reverse character prediction tasks using the tokenizer's vocabulary. Experiments demonstrate that TIPA enhances position prediction accuracy in LLMs, enabling more precise identification of target characters in original text. Furthermore, when applied to downstream tasks that do not require exact position prediction, TIPA still boosts performance in tasks needing character-level information, validating its versatility and effectiveness.

Abstract: Ambiguous words are often found in modern digital communications. Lexical ambiguity challenges traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods, due to limited data. Consequently, the efficiency of translation, information retrieval, and question-answering systems is hindered by these limitations. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve WSD using a novel approach combining a systematic prompt augmentation mechanism with a knowledge base (KB) consisting of different sense interpretations. The proposed method incorporates a human-in-loop approach for prompt augmentation where prompt is supported by Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, synonyms of ambiguous words, aspect-based sense filtering and few-shot prompting to guide the LLM. By utilizing a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompting-based approach, this work demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance. The evaluation was conducted using FEWS test data and sense tags. This research advances accurate word interpretation in social media and digital communication.

Abstract: This paper presents Patent-CR, the first dataset created for the patent claim revision task in English. It includes both initial patent applications rejected by patent examiners and the final granted versions. Unlike normal text revision tasks that predominantly focus on enhancing sentence quality, such as grammar correction and coherence improvement, patent claim revision aims at ensuring the claims meet stringent legal criteria. These criteria are beyond novelty and inventiveness, including clarity of scope, technical accuracy, language precision, and legal robustness. We assess various large language models (LLMs) through professional human evaluation, including general LLMs with different sizes and architectures, text revision models, and domain-specific models. Our results indicate that LLMs often bring ineffective edits that deviate from the target revisions. In addition, domain-specific models and the method of fine-tuning show promising results. Notably, GPT-4 outperforms other tested LLMs, but further revisions are still necessary to reach the examination standard. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inconsistency between automated and human evaluation results, suggesting that GPT-4-based automated evaluation has the highest correlation with human judgment. This dataset, along with our preliminary empirical research, offers invaluable insights for further exploration in patent claim revision.

Abstract: Determining company similarity is a vital task in finance, underpinning risk management, hedging, and portfolio diversification. Practitioners often rely on sector and industry classifications such as SIC and GICS codes to gauge similarity, the former being used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the latter widely used by the investment community. Since these classifications lack granularity and need regular updating, using clusters of embeddings of company descriptions has been proposed as a potential alternative, but the lack of interpretability in token embeddings poses a significant barrier to adoption in high-stakes contexts. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in enhancing the interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing Large Language Model (LLM) activations into interpretable features. Moreover, SAEs capture an LLM's internal representation of a company description, as opposed to semantic similarity alone, as is the case with embeddings. We apply SAEs to company descriptions, and obtain meaningful clusters of equities. We benchmark SAE features against SIC-codes, Industry codes, and Embeddings. Our results demonstrate that SAE features surpass sector classifications and embeddings in capturing fundamental company characteristics. This is evidenced by their superior performance in correlating logged monthly returns - a proxy for similarity - and generating higher Sharpe ratios in co-integration trading strategies, which underscores deeper fundamental similarities among companies. Finally, we verify the interpretability of our clusters, and demonstrate that sparse features form simple and interpretable explanations for our clusters.

Abstract: This paper aims to improve the performance of large language models by addressing the variable computational demands in inference steps, where some tokens require more computational resources than others. We present HARP, a simple modification to "off-the-shelf" Transformer forward pass. Drawing from hesitation and the framing effect in decision-making, HARP selectively applies additional computation when the model encounters uncertainty during token generation. Our method mimics human cognitive processes by pausing at difficult decision points and reframing inputs for a different perspective. Unlike other approaches, HARP is model-agnostic, training-free, and easy to implement. We evaluate our method across various downstream tasks and model sizes, demonstrating performance improvements up to +5.16%. Notably, HARP achieves these gains while maintaining inference times twice faster than beam search. Simple and yet with significant gains, HARP provides insights into the potential of adaptive computation for enhancing the performance of Transformer-based language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been found to create plans that are neither executable nor verifiable in grounded environments. An emerging line of work demonstrates success in using the LLM as a formalizer to generate a formal representation of the planning domain in some language, such as Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). This formal representation can be deterministically solved to find a plan. We systematically evaluate this methodology while bridging some major gaps. While previous work only generates a partial PDDL representation, given templated, and therefore unrealistic environment descriptions, we generate the complete representation given descriptions of various naturalness levels. Among an array of observations critical to improve LLMs' formal planning abilities, we note that most large enough models can effectively formalize descriptions as PDDL, outperforming those directly generating plans, while being robust to lexical perturbation. As the descriptions become more natural-sounding, we observe a decrease in performance and provide detailed error analysis.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have excelled in various broad domains. However, to ensure their safe and effective integration into real-world educational settings, they must demonstrate proficiency in specific, granular areas of knowledge. Existing cloze-style benchmarks, commonly used to evaluate LMs' knowledge, have three major limitations. They: 1) do not cover the educational domain; 2) typically focus on low-complexity, generic knowledge or broad domains, which do not adequately assess the models' knowledge in specific subjects; and 3) often rely on templates that can bias model predictions. Here, we introduce MALAMUTE, a multilingual, template-free, and highly granular probing dataset comprising expert-written, peer-reviewed probes from 71 university-level textbooks across three languages (English, Spanish, and Polish). MALAMUTE is the first education-based cloze-style dataset. It covers eight domains, each with up to 14 subdomains, further broken down into concepts and concept-based prompts, totaling 33,361 university curriculum concepts and 116,887 prompts. MALAMUTE's fine granularity, educational focus, and inclusion of both sentence-level and paragraph-level prompts make it an ideal tool for evaluating LMs' course-related knowledge. Our evaluation of masked and causal LMs on MALAMUTE shows that despite overall proficiency, they have significant gaps in knowledge when examined closely on specific subjects, hindering their safe use in classrooms and underscoring the need for further development.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as an effective approach for activating latent capabilities in LLMs. Interestingly, we observe that both CoT reasoning and self-training share the core objective: iteratively leveraging model-generated information to progressively reduce prediction uncertainty. Building on this insight, we propose a novel CoT framework to improve reasoning performance. Our framework integrates two key components: (i) a task-specific prompt module that optimizes the initial reasoning process, and (ii) an adaptive reasoning iteration module that dynamically refines the reasoning process and addresses the limitations of previous CoT approaches, \ie over-reasoning and high similarity between consecutive reasoning iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant advantages in both performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) achieve effective safety alignment at the time of release, they still face various safety challenges. A key issue is that fine-tuning often compromises the safety alignment of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a method named IRR (Identify, Remove, and Recalibrate for Safety Realignment) that performs safety realignment for LLMs. The core of IRR is to identify and remove unsafe delta parameters from the fine-tuned models, while recalibrating the retained ones. We evaluate the effectiveness of IRR across various datasets, including both full fine-tuning and LoRA methods. Our results demonstrate that IRR significantly enhances the safety performance of fine-tuned models on safety benchmarks, such as harmful queries and jailbreak attacks, while maintaining their performance on downstream tasks.

<title>Segment-Level Diffusion: A Framework for Controllable Long-Form Generation with Diffusion Language Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promise in text generation, but often struggle with generating long, coherent, and contextually accurate text. Token-level diffusion doesn't model word-order dependencies explicitly and operates on short, fixed output windows, while passage-level diffusion struggles with learning robust representations for long-form text. To address these challenges, we propose Segment-Level Diffusion (SLD), a framework that enhances diffusion-based text generation through text segmentation, robust representation training with adversarial and contrastive learning, and improved latent-space guidance. By segmenting long-form outputs into multiple latent representations and decoding them with an autoregressive decoder, SLD simplifies diffusion predictions and improves scalability. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that, when compared to other diffusion and autoregressive baselines SLD achieves competitive or superior fluency, coherence, and contextual compatibility in automatic and human evaluations.

<title>What External Knowledge is Preferred by LLMs? Characterizing and Exploring Chain of Evidence in Imperfect Context for Multi-Hop QA</title>

Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge has emerged as a promising way to mitigate outdated knowledge and hallucinations in LLM. However, external knowledge is often imperfect, encompassing substantial extraneous or even inaccurate content, which interferes with the LLM's utilization of useful knowledge in the context. This paper seeks to characterize the features of preferred external knowledge and perform empirical studies in imperfect contexts. Inspired by the chain of evidence (CoE), we characterize that the knowledge preferred by LLMs should maintain both relevance to the question and mutual support among the textual pieces. Accordingly, we propose a CoE discrimination approach and conduct a comparative analysis between CoE and Non-CoE samples across significance, deceptiveness, and robustness, revealing the LLM's preference for external knowledge that aligns with CoE features. Furthermore, we selected three representative tasks (RAG-based multi-hop QA, external knowledge poisoning and poisoning defense), along with corresponding SOTA or prevalent baselines. By integrating CoE features, the variants achieved significant improvements over the original baselines.

<title>Expansion Span: Combining Fading Memory and Retrieval in Hybrid State Space Models</title>

Abstract: The "state" of State Space Models (SSMs) represents their memory, which fades exponentially over an unbounded span. By contrast, Attention-based models have "eidetic" (i.e., verbatim, or photographic) memory over a finite span (context size). Hybrid architectures combine State Space layers with Attention, but still cannot recall the distant past and can access only the most recent tokens eidetically. Unlike current methods of combining SSM and Attention layers, we allow the state to be allocated based on relevancy rather than recency. In this way, for every new set of query tokens, our models can "eidetically" access tokens from beyond the Attention span of current Hybrid SSMs without requiring extra hardware resources. We introduce a method to expand the memory span of the hybrid state by "reserving" a fraction of the Attention context for tokens retrieved from arbitrarily distant in the past, thus expanding the eidetic memory span of the overall state. We call this reserved fraction of tokens the "expansion span," and the mechanism to retrieve and aggregate it "Span-Expanded Attention" (SE-Attn). To adapt Hybrid models to using SE-Attn, we propose a novel fine-tuning method that extends LoRA to Hybrid models (HyLoRA) and allows efficient adaptation on long spans of tokens. We show that SE-Attn enables us to efficiently adapt pre-trained Hybrid models on sequences of tokens up to 8 times longer than the ones used for pre-training. We show that HyLoRA with SE-Attn is cheaper and more performant than alternatives like LongLoRA when applied to Hybrid models on natural language benchmarks with long-range dependencies, such as PG-19, RULER, and other common natural language downstream tasks.

Abstract: Language model agents excel in long-session planning and reasoning, but existing benchmarks primarily focus on goal-oriented tasks with explicit objectives, neglecting creative adaptation in unfamiliar environments. To address this, we introduce EscapeBench, a benchmark suite of room escape game environments designed to challenge agents with creative reasoning, unconventional tool use, and iterative problem-solving to uncover implicit goals. Our results show that current LM models, despite employing working memory and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, achieve only 15% average progress without hints, highlighting their limitations in creativity. To bridge this gap, we propose EscapeAgent, a framework designed to enhance creative reasoning through Foresight (innovative tool use) and Reflection (identifying unsolved tasks). Experiments show that EscapeAgent can execute action chains over 1,000 steps while maintaining logical coherence. It navigates and completes games with up to 40% fewer steps and hints, performs robustly across difficulty levels, and achieves higher action success rates with more efficient and innovative puzzle-solving strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks yet still are vulnerable to external threats, particularly LLM Denial-of-Service (LLM-DoS) attacks. Specifically, LLM-DoS attacks aim to exhaust computational resources and block services. However, existing studies predominantly focus on white-box attacks, leaving black-box scenarios underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Generation for LLM-DoS (AutoDoS) attack, an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs. AutoDoS constructs the DoS Attack Tree and expands the node coverage to achieve effectiveness under black-box conditions. By transferability-driven iterative optimization, AutoDoS could work across different models in one prompt. Furthermore, we reveal that embedding the Length Trojan allows AutoDoS to bypass existing defenses more effectively. Experimental results show that AutoDoS significantly amplifies service response latency by over 250$\times\uparrow$, leading to severe resource consumption in terms of GPU utilization and memory usage. Our work provides a new perspective on LLM-DoS attacks and security defenses. Our code is available at https://github.com/shuita2333/AutoDoS.

Abstract: Model collapse in synthetic data indicates that iterative training on self-generated data leads to a gradual decline in performance. With the proliferation of AI models, synthetic data will fundamentally reshape the web data ecosystem. Future GPT-$\{n\}$ models will inevitably be trained on a blend of synthetic and human-produced data. In this paper, we focus on two questions: what is the impact of synthetic data on language model training, and how to synthesize data without model collapse? We first pre-train language models across different proportions of synthetic data, revealing a negative correlation between the proportion of synthetic data and model performance. We further conduct statistical analysis on synthetic data to uncover distributional shift phenomenon and over-concentration of n-gram features. Inspired by the above findings, we propose token editing on human-produced data to obtain semi-synthetic data. As a proof of concept, we theoretically demonstrate that token-level editing can prevent model collapse, as the test error is constrained by a finite upper bound. We conduct extensive experiments on pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning. The results validate our theoretical proof that token-level editing improves model performance.

<title>DynamicKV: Task-Aware Adaptive KV Cache Compression for Long Context LLMs</title>

Abstract: Efficient KV cache management in LLMs is crucial for long-context tasks like RAG and summarization. Existing KV cache compression methods enforce a fixed pattern, neglecting task-specific characteristics and reducing the retention of essential information. However, we observe distinct activation patterns across layers in various tasks, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies tailored to each task's unique demands. Based on this insight, we propose DynamicKV, a method that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of tokens retained at each layer to adapt to the specific task. DynamicKV establishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily retaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating the KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains only 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache performance on LongBench. Notably, even under extreme compression (0.9%), DynamicKV surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11% in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The code will be released.

<title>ComparisonQA: Evaluating Factuality Robustness of LLMs Through Knowledge Frequency Control and Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: The rapid development of LLMs has sparked extensive research into their factual knowledge. Current works find that LLMs fall short on questions around low-frequency entities. However, such proofs are unreliable since the questions can differ not only in entity frequency but also in difficulty themselves. So we introduce ComparisonQA benchmark, containing 283K abstract questions, each instantiated by a pair of high-frequency and low-frequency entities. It ensures a controllable comparison to study the role of knowledge frequency in the performance of LLMs. Because the difference between such a pair is only the entity with different frequencies. In addition, we use both correctness and uncertainty to develop a two-round method to evaluate LLMs' knowledge robustness. It aims to avoid possible semantic shortcuts which is a serious problem of current QA study. Experiments reveal that LLMs, including GPT-4o, exhibit particularly low robustness regarding low-frequency knowledge. Besides, we find that uncertainty can be used to effectively identify high-quality and shortcut-free questions while maintaining the data size. Based on this, we propose an automatic method to select such questions to form a subset called ComparisonQA-Hard, containing only hard low-frequency questions.

Abstract: The multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) aims for arbitrary translations across multiple languages. Although MNMT-specific models trained on parallel data offer low costs in training and deployment, their performance consistently lags behind that of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce registering, a novel method that enables a small MNMT-specific model to compete with LLMs. Specifically, we insert a set of artificial tokens specifying the target language, called registers, into the input sequence between the source and target tokens. By modifying the attention mask, the target token generation only pays attention to the activation of registers, representing the source tokens in the target language space. Experiments on EC-40, a large-scale benchmark, show that our method advances the state-of-the-art of MNMT. We further pre-train two models, namely MITRE (multilingual translation with registers), by 9.3 billion sentence pairs across 24 languages collected from public corpora. One of them, MITRE-913M, outperforms NLLB-3.3B, achieves comparable performance with commercial LLMs, and shows strong adaptability in fine-tuning. Finally, we open-source our models to facilitate further research and development in MNMT: https://github.com/zhiqu22/mitre.

Abstract: Recent advancements in omnimodal learning have significantly improved understanding and generation across images, text, and speech, yet these developments remain predominantly confined to proprietary models. The lack of high-quality omnimodal datasets and the challenges of real-time emotional speech synthesis have notably hindered progress in open-source research. To address these limitations, we introduce \name, a two-stage training framework that integrates omnimodal alignment and speech generation to develop a state-of-the-art omnimodal large language model. In the alignment phase, a pre-trained speech model undergoes further training on text-image tasks, enabling (near) zero-shot generalization from vision to speech, outperforming models trained on tri-modal datasets. In the speech generation phase, a lightweight decoder is trained on speech tasks with direct preference optimization, enabling real-time emotional speech synthesis with high fidelity. Experiments show that \name surpasses state-of-the-art models across omnimodal, vision-language, and speech-language benchmarks. It achieves a 4-point absolute improvement on OmniBench over the leading open-source model VITA, despite using 5x fewer training samples and a smaller model size (7B vs. 7x8B). Additionally, \name achieves real-time speech generation with <1s latency at non-autoregressive mode, reducing inference time by 5x compared to autoregressive methods, and improves emotion classification accuracy by 7.7\%

Abstract: Tokenization is the process of encoding strings into tokens of a fixed vocabulary size, and is widely utilized in Natural Language Processing applications. The leading tokenization algorithm today is Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), which formulates the tokenization problem as a compression problem and tackles it by performing sequences of merges. In this work, we formulate tokenization as an optimization objective, show that it is NP-hard via a simple reduction from vertex cover, and propose a polynomial-time greedy algorithm GreedTok. Our formulation naturally relaxes to the well-studied weighted maximum coverage problem which has a simple $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation algorithm GreedWMC. Through empirical evaluations on real-world corpora, we show that GreedTok outperforms BPE and Unigram on compression and achieves a covering score comparable to GreedWMC. Finally, our extensive pre-training for two transformer-based language models with 1 billion parameters, comparing the choices of BPE and GreedTok as the tokenizer, shows that GreedTok achieves a lower bit per byte even when we control for either the total dataset proportion or total training tokens.

Abstract: Limited availability of multilingual text corpora for training language models often leads to poor performance on downstream tasks due to undertrained representation spaces for languages other than English. This 'under-representation' has motivated recent cross-lingual transfer methods to leverage the English representation space by e.g. mixing English and 'non-English' tokens at the input level or extending model parameters to accommodate new languages. However, these approaches often come at the cost of increased computational complexity. We propose Fusion forLanguage Representations (FLARE) in adapters, a novel method that enhances representation quality and downstream performance for languages other than English while maintaining parameter efficiency. FLARE integrates source and target language representations within low-rank (LoRA) adapters using lightweight linear transformations, maintaining parameter efficiency while improving transfer performance. A series of experiments across representative cross-lingual natural language understanding tasks, including natural language inference, question-answering and sentiment analysis, demonstrate FLARE's effectiveness. FLARE achieves performance improvements of 4.9% for Llama 3.1 and 2.2% for Gemma~2 compared to standard LoRA fine-tuning on question-answering tasks, as measured by the exact match metric.

Abstract: We present the e-Llama models: 8 billion and 70 billion parameter large language models that are adapted towards the e-commerce domain. These models are meant as foundation models with deep knowledge about e-commerce, that form a base for instruction- and fine-tuning. The e-Llama models are obtained by continuously pretraining the Llama 3.1 base models on 1 trillion tokens of domain-specific data.
  We discuss our approach and motivate our choice of hyperparameters with a series of ablation studies. To quantify how well the models have been adapted to the e-commerce domain, we define and implement a set of multilingual, e-commerce specific evaluation tasks.
  We show that, when carefully choosing the training setup, the Llama 3.1 models can be adapted towards the new domain without sacrificing significant performance on general domain tasks. We also explore the possibility of merging the adapted model and the base model for a better control of the performance trade-off between domains.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising approach to enhance their capabilities, especially for complex tasks. Synthesizing tool-use data through real-world simulations is an effective way to achieve this. However, our investigation reveals that training gains significantly decay as synthetic data increases. The model struggles to benefit from more synthetic data, and it can not equip the model with advanced tool-use capabilities in complex scenarios. Moreover, we discovered that the above limitation usually manifests as a fragment deficiency (i.e., parameter errors) in response. To this end, we propose an iterative reinforced fine-tuning strategy designed to alleviate this limitation. This strategy involves: (1) enhancing the diversity of response for synthetic data through path exploration of Monte Carlo Tree Search. (2) iteratively pinpointing the model's deficiency by constructing fine-grained preference pairs, and then improving it by preference optimization algorithms for targeted improvement. The experiments show that our method achieves 13.11% better performance than the same-size base model. It achieves an improvement of 6.5% in complex scenarios compared to the baseline, and it also outperforms larger open-source and closed-source models.

Abstract: Recent efforts leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for modeling text-attributed graph structures in node classification tasks. These approaches describe graph structures for LLMs to understand or aggregate LLM-generated textual attribute embeddings through graph structure. However, these approaches face two main limitations in modeling graph structures with LLMs. (i) Graph descriptions become verbose in describing high-order graph structure. (ii) Textual attributes alone do not contain adequate graph structure information. It is challenging to model graph structure concisely and adequately with LLMs. LLMs lack built-in mechanisms to model graph structures directly. They also struggle with complex long-range dependencies between high-order nodes and target nodes.
  Inspired by the observation that LLMs pre-trained on one language can achieve exceptional performance on another with minimal additional training, we propose \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{D}efined \textbf{L}anguage for \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel (GDL4LLM). This novel framework enables LLMs to transfer their powerful language understanding capabilities to graph-structured data. GDL4LLM translates graphs into a graph language corpus instead of graph descriptions and pre-trains LLMs on this corpus to adequately understand graph structures. During fine-tuning, this corpus describes the structural information of target nodes concisely with only a few tokens. By treating graphs as a new language, GDL4LLM enables LLMs to model graph structures adequately and concisely for node classification tasks. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDL4LLM outperforms description-based and textual attribute embeddings-based baselines by efficiently modeling different orders of graph structure with LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have made significant strides yet remain a challenge due to the scarcity of long documents. Existing methods tend to synthesize long-context data but lack a clear mechanism to reinforce the long-range dependency modeling. To address this limitation, we propose NExtLong, a novel framework for synthesizing long-context data through Negative document Extension. NExtLong decomposes a document into multiple meta-chunks and extends the context by interleaving hard negative distractors retrieved from pretraining corpora. This approach compels the model to discriminate long-range dependent context from distracting content, enhancing its ability to model long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NExtLong achieves significant performance improvements on the HELMET and RULER benchmarks compared to existing long-context synthesis approaches and leading models, which are trained on non-synthetic long documents. These findings highlight NExtLong's ability to reduce reliance on non-synthetic long documents, making it an effective framework for developing advanced long-context LLMs.

Abstract: Most social media users come from non-English speaking countries in the Global South, where much of harmful content appears in local languages. Yet, current AI-driven moderation systems struggle with low-resource languages spoken in these regions. This work examines the systemic challenges in building automated moderation tools for these languages. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 AI experts working on detecting harmful content in four low-resource languages: Tamil (South Asia), Swahili (East Africa), Maghrebi Arabic (North Africa), and Quechua (South America). Our findings show that beyond the well-known data scarcity in local languages, technical issues--such as outdated machine translation systems, sentiment and toxicity models grounded in Western values, and unreliable language detection technologies--undermine moderation efforts. Even with more data, current language models and preprocessing pipelines--primarily designed for English--struggle with the morphological richness, linguistic complexity, and code-mixing. As a result, automated moderation in Tamil, Swahili, Arabic, and Quechua remains fraught with inaccuracies and blind spots. Based on our findings, we argue that these limitations are not just technical gaps but reflect deeper structural inequities that continue to reproduce historical power imbalances. We conclude by discussing multi-stakeholder approaches to improve automated moderation for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Homogeneity bias is one form of stereotyping in AI models where certain groups are represented as more similar to each other than other groups. This bias is a major obstacle to creating equitable language technologies. We test whether the bias is driven by systematic differences in token-sampling uncertainty across six large language models. While we observe the presence of homogeneity bias using sentence similarity, we find very little difference in token sampling uncertainty across groups. This finding elucidates why temperature-based sampling adjustments fail to mitigate homogeneity bias. It suggests researchers should prioritize interventions targeting representation learning mechanisms and training corpus composition rather than inference-time output manipulations.

Abstract: This paper introduces a checks-and-balances framework for ethical alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), inspired by three-branch governmental systems. It implements three independent yet interacting components: LLMs as the executive branch for knowledge generation, DIKE as the legislative branch establishing ethical guardrails, and ERIS as the judicial branch for contextual interpretation. Beyond structural separation, we address a fundamental challenge: regulating emotion to shape behaviors. Drawing from psychological theories where managing emotional responses prevents harmful behaviors, we develop a self-supervised learning pipeline that maps emotions to linguistic behaviors, enabling precise behavioral modulation through emotional conditioning. By integrating this approach with adversarial testing, our framework demonstrates how DIKE and ERIS direct linguistic behaviors toward ethical outcomes while preserving independence throughout knowledge generation, ethical oversight, and contextual interpretation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics. However, the domain of physics reasoning presents unique challenges that have received significantly less attention. Existing benchmarks often fall short in evaluating LLMs' abilities on the breadth and depth of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for a comprehensive evaluation. To fill this gap, we introduce UGPhysics, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate UnderGraduate-level Physics (UGPhysics) reasoning with LLMs. UGPhysics includes 5,520 undergraduate-level physics problems in both English and Chinese, covering 13 subjects with seven different answer types and four distinct physics reasoning skills, all rigorously screened for data leakage. Additionally, we develop a Model-Assistant Rule-based Judgment (MARJ) pipeline specifically tailored for assessing answer correctness of physics problems, ensuring accurate evaluation. Our evaluation of 31 leading LLMs shows that the highest overall accuracy, 49.8% (achieved by OpenAI-o1-mini), emphasizes the necessity for models with stronger physics reasoning skills, beyond math abilities. We hope UGPhysics, along with MARJ, will drive future advancements in AI for physics reasoning. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/YangLabHKUST/UGPhysics .

Abstract: To address the challenge of quantifying uncertainty in the outputs generated by language models, we propose a novel measure of semantic uncertainty, semantic spectral entropy, that is statistically consistent under mild assumptions. This measure is implemented through a straightforward algorithm that relies solely on standard, pretrained language models, without requiring access to the internal generation process. Our approach imposes minimal constraints on the choice of language models, making it broadly applicable across different architectures and settings. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed method yields an accurate and robust estimate of semantic uncertainty, even in the presence of the inherent randomness characteristic of generative language model outputs.

Abstract: The GPT-4 technical report highlights the possibility of predicting model performance on downstream tasks using only pre-training signals, though detailed methodologies are absent. Such predictive capabilities are essential for resource-efficient pre-training and the construction of task-aligned datasets. In this paper, we aim to predict performance in closed-book question answering (QA), a vital downstream task indicative of a model's internal knowledge. We address three primary challenges: (1) limited access to and understanding of pre-training corpora, (2) limitations of current evaluation methods for pre-trained models, and (3) limitations of frequency-based metrics in predicting model performance. In response to these challenges, we conduct large-scale retrieval and semantic analysis across the pre-training corpora of 21 publicly available and 3 custom-trained large language models. Subsequently, we develop a multi-template QA evaluation framework incorporating paraphrased question variants. Building on these foundations, we propose Size-dependent Mutual Information (SMI), an information-theoretic metric that linearly correlates pre-training data characteristics, model size, and QA accuracy, without requiring any additional training. The experimental results demonstrate that SMI outperforms co-occurrence-based baselines, achieving $R^2$ > 0.75 on models with over one billion parameters. Theoretical analysis further reveals the marginal benefits of scaling model size and optimizing data, indicating that the upper limit of specific QA task accuracy is approximately 80%. Our project is available at https://github.com/yuhui1038/SMI.

Abstract: The effective application of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) requires extensive knowledge of TCM and clinical experience. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a solution to this, while existing LLMs for TCM exhibit critical limitations of incomplete clinical consultation and diagnoses, as well as inaccurate syndrome differentiation. To address these issues, we establish JingFang (JF), a novel TCM LLM that demonstrates the level of expertise in clinical consultation and syndrome differentiation. We propose a Multi-Agent Collaborative Chain-of-Thought Mechanism (MACCTM) for comprehensive and targeted clinical consultation, enabling JF with effective and accurate diagnostic ability. In addition, a Syndrome Agent and a Dual-Stage Recovery Scheme (DSRS) are developed to accurately enhance the differentiation of the syndrome and the subsequent corresponding treatment. JingFang not only facilitates the application of LLMs but also promotes the effective application of TCM for healthcare.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease affecting 50 million people worldwide. Low-cost, accurate identification of key markers of AD is crucial for timely diagnosis and intervention. Language impairment is one of the earliest signs of cognitive decline, which can be used to discriminate AD patients from normal control individuals. Patient-interviewer dialogues may be used to detect such impairments, but they are often mixed with ambiguous, noisy, and irrelevant information, making the AD detection task difficult. Moreover, the limited availability of AD speech samples and variability in their speech styles pose significant challenges in developing robust speech-based AD detection models. To address these challenges, we propose DECT, a novel speech-based domain-specific approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) for fine-grained linguistic analysis and label-switched label-preserved data generation. Our study presents four novelties: We harness the summarizing capabilities of LLMs to identify and distill key Cognitive-Linguistic information from noisy speech transcripts, effectively filtering irrelevant information. We leverage the inherent linguistic knowledge of LLMs to extract linguistic markers from unstructured and heterogeneous audio transcripts. We exploit the compositional ability of LLMs to generate AD speech transcripts consisting of diverse linguistic patterns to overcome the speech data scarcity challenge and enhance the robustness of AD detection models. We use the augmented AD textual speech transcript dataset and a more fine-grained representation of AD textual speech transcript data to fine-tune the AD detection model. The results have shown that DECT demonstrates superior model performance with an 11% improvement in AD detection accuracy on the datasets from DementiaBank compared to the baselines.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made it difficult to differentiate human-written text from AI-generated text. Several AI-text detectors have been developed in response, which typically utilize a fixed global threshold (e.g., $\theta = 0.5$) to classify machine-generated text. However, one universal threshold could fail to account for distributional variations by subgroups. For example, when using a fixed threshold, detectors make more false positive errors on shorter human-written text, and more positive classifications of neurotic writing styles among long texts. These discrepancies can lead to misclassifications that disproportionately affect certain groups. We address this critical limitation by introducing FairOPT, an algorithm for group-specific threshold optimization for probabilistic AI-text detectors. We partitioned data into subgroups based on attributes (e.g., text length and writing style) and implemented FairOPT to learn decision thresholds for each group to reduce discrepancy. In experiments with nine AI text classifiers on three datasets, FairOPT decreases overall balanced error rate (BER) discrepancy by 12\% while minimally sacrificing accuracy by 0.003\%. Our framework paves the way for more robust classification in AI-generated content detection via post-processing.

Abstract: Training LLMs on data containing unfamiliar knowledge during the instruction tuning stage can encourage hallucinations. To address this challenge, we introduce NOVA, a novel framework designed to identify high-quality data that aligns well with the LLM's learned knowledge to reduce hallucinations. NOVA includes Internal Consistency Probing (ICP) and Semantic Equivalence Identification (SEI) to measure how familiar the LLM is with instruction data. Specifically, ICP evaluates the LLM's understanding of the given instruction by calculating the tailored consistency among multiple self-generated responses. SEI further assesses the familiarity of the LLM with the target response by comparing it to the generated responses, using the proposed semantic clustering and well-designed voting strategy. Finally, to ensure the quality of selected samples, we introduce an expert-aligned reward model, considering characteristics beyond just familiarity. By considering data quality and avoiding unfamiliar data, we can utilize the selected data to effectively align LLMs to follow instructions and hallucinate less.

Abstract: Transforming recorded videos into concise and accurate textual summaries is a growing challenge in multimodal learning. This paper introduces VISTA, a dataset specifically designed for video-to-text summarization in scientific domains. VISTA contains 18,599 recorded AI conference presentations paired with their corresponding paper abstracts. We benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art large models and apply a plan-based framework to better capture the structured nature of abstracts. Both human and automated evaluations confirm that explicit planning enhances summary quality and factual consistency. However, a considerable gap remains between models and human performance, highlighting the challenges of our dataset. This study aims to pave the way for future research on scientific video-to-text summarization.

Abstract: Providing Language Models (LMs) with relevant evidence in the context (either via retrieval or user-provided) can significantly improve their ability to provide better-grounded responses. However, recent studies have found that LMs often struggle to fully comprehend and utilize key evidence from the context, especially when it contains noise and irrelevant information, an issue common in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose SelfElicit, an inference-time approach that helps LMs focus on key contextual evidence through self-guided explicit highlighting. By leveraging the inherent evidence-finding capabilities of LMs using the attention scores of deeper layers, our method automatically identifies and emphasizes key evidence within the input context, facilitating more accurate and grounded responses without additional training or iterative prompting. We demonstrate that SelfElicit brings consistent and significant improvement on multiple evidence-based QA tasks for various LM families while maintaining computational efficiency. Our code and documentation are available at https://github.com/ZhiningLiu1998/SelfElicit.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in commonsense reasoning; however, some variations in questions can trigger incorrect responses. Do these models truly understand commonsense knowledge, or just memorize expression patterns? To investigate this question, we present the first extensive robustness evaluation of LLMs in commonsense reasoning. We introduce HellaSwag-Pro, a large-scale bilingual benchmark consisting of 11,200 cases, by designing and compiling seven types of question variants. To construct this benchmark, we propose a two-stage method to develop Chinese HellaSwag, a finely annotated dataset comprising 12,000 instances across 56 categories. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 representative LLMs, revealing that these LLMs are far from robust in commonsense reasoning. Furthermore, this robustness varies depending on the language in which the LLM is tested. This work establishes a high-quality evaluation benchmark, with extensive experiments offering valuable insights to the community in commonsense reasoning for LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, inference-time scaling of chain-of-thought (CoT) has been demonstrated as a promising approach for addressing multi-modal reasoning tasks. While existing studies have predominantly centered on text-based thinking, the integration of both visual and textual modalities within the reasoning process remains unexplored. In this study, we pioneer the exploration of inference-time scaling with multi-modal thought, aiming to bridge this gap. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we systematically investigate popular sampling-based and tree search-based inference-time scaling methods on 10 challenging tasks spanning various domains. Besides, we uniformly adopt a consistency-enhanced verifier to ensure effective guidance for both methods across different thought paradigms. Results show that multi-modal thought promotes better performance against conventional text-only thought, and blending the two types of thought fosters more diverse thinking. Despite these advantages, multi-modal thoughts necessitate higher token consumption for processing richer visual inputs, which raises concerns in practical applications. We hope that our findings on the merits and drawbacks of this research line will inspire future works in the field.

Abstract: The radioactive nature of Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking enables the detection of watermarks inherited by student models when trained on the outputs of watermarked teacher models, making it a promising tool for preventing unauthorized knowledge distillation. However, the robustness of watermark radioactivity against adversarial actors remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether student models can acquire the capabilities of teacher models through knowledge distillation while avoiding watermark inheritance. We propose two categories of watermark removal approaches: pre-distillation removal through untargeted and targeted training data paraphrasing (UP and TP), and post-distillation removal through inference-time watermark neutralization (WN). Extensive experiments across multiple model pairs, watermarking schemes and hyper-parameter settings demonstrate that both TP and WN thoroughly eliminate inherited watermarks, with WN achieving this while maintaining knowledge transfer efficiency and low computational overhead. Given the ongoing deployment of watermarking techniques in production LLMs, these findings emphasize the urgent need for more robust defense strategies. Our code is available at https://github.com/THU-BPM/Watermark-Radioactivity-Attack.

Abstract: The escalating volume of academic research, coupled with a shortage of qualified reviewers, necessitates innovative approaches to peer review. In this work, we propose: 1. ReviewEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI-generated reviews that measures alignment with human assessments, verifies factual accuracy, assesses analytical depth, identifies degree of constructiveness and adherence to reviewer guidelines; and 2. ReviewAgent, an LLM-based review generation agent featuring a novel alignment mechanism to tailor feedback to target conferences and journals, along with a self-refinement loop that iteratively optimizes its intermediate outputs and an external improvement loop using ReviewEval to improve upon the final reviews. ReviewAgent improves actionable insights by 6.78% and 47.62% over existing AI baselines and expert reviews respectively. Further, it boosts analytical depth by 3.97% and 12.73%, enhances adherence to guidelines by 10.11% and 47.26% respectively. This paper establishes essential metrics for AIbased peer review and substantially enhances the reliability and impact of AI-generated reviews in academic research.

<title>Balancing Truthfulness and Informativeness with Uncertainty-Aware Instruction Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning (IFT) can increase the informativeness of large language models (LLMs), but may reduce their truthfulness. This trade-off arises because IFT steers LLMs to generate responses containing long-tail knowledge that was not well covered during pre-training. As a result, models become more informative but less accurate when generalizing to unseen tasks. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate how unfamiliar knowledge in IFT datasets can negatively affect the truthfulness of LLMs, and we introduce two new IFT paradigms, $UNIT_{cut}$ and $UNIT_{ref}$, to address this issue. $UNIT_{cut}$ identifies and removes unfamiliar knowledge from IFT datasets to mitigate its impact on model truthfulness, whereas $UNIT_{ref}$ trains LLMs to recognize their uncertainty and explicitly indicate it at the end of their responses. Our experiments show that $UNIT_{cut}$ substantially improves LLM truthfulness, while $UNIT_{ref}$ maintains high informativeness and reduces hallucinations by distinguishing between confident and uncertain statements.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have revolutionized the design and optimization of large-scale AI models by revealing predictable relationships between model size, dataset volume, and computational resources. Early research established power-law relationships in model performance, leading to compute-optimal scaling strategies. However, recent studies highlighted their limitations across architectures, modalities, and deployment contexts. Sparse models, mixture-of-experts, retrieval-augmented learning, and multimodal models often deviate from traditional scaling patterns. Moreover, scaling behaviors vary across domains such as vision, reinforcement learning, and fine-tuning, underscoring the need for more nuanced approaches. In this survey, we synthesize insights from over 50 studies, examining the theoretical foundations, empirical findings, and practical implications of scaling laws. We also explore key challenges, including data efficiency, inference scaling, and architecture-specific constraints, advocating for adaptive scaling strategies tailored to real-world applications. We suggest that while scaling laws provide a useful guide, they do not always generalize across all architectures and training strategies.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent advancements, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT sequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance. However, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs lead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user experience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this limitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and reveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we propose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to selectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT compression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving strong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, TokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less than a 0.4% performance drop.

To address this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of step-by-step reasoning evaluation, proposing a taxonomy of evaluation criteria with four top-level categories (factuality, validity, coherence, and utility). Based on the taxonomy, we review different evaluator implementations and recent findings, leading to promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Like humans, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to generate high-quality long-form text that adheres to strict requirements in a single pass. This challenge is unsurprising, as successful human writing, according to the Cognitive Writing Theory, is a complex cognitive process involving iterative planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. Motivated by these cognitive principles, we aim to equip LLMs with human-like cognitive writing capabilities through CogWriter, a novel training-free framework that transforms LLM constrained long-form text generation into a systematic cognitive writing paradigm. Our framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Planning Agent that performs hierarchical planning to decompose the task, and (2) multiple Generation Agents that execute these plans in parallel. The system maintains quality via continuous monitoring and reviewing mechanisms, which evaluate outputs against specified requirements and trigger necessary revisions. CogWriter demonstrates exceptional performance on LongGenBench, a benchmark for complex constrained long-form text generation. Even when using Qwen-2.5-14B as its backbone, CogWriter surpasses GPT-4o by 22% in complex instruction completion accuracy while reliably generating texts exceeding 10,000 words. We hope this cognitive science-inspired approach provides a paradigm for LLM writing advancements: \href{https://github.com/KaiyangWan/CogWriter}{CogWriter}.

<title>Speech-FT: Merging Pre-trained And Fine-Tuned Speech Representation Models For Cross-Task Generalization</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning speech representation models can enhance performance on specific tasks but often compromises their cross-task generalization ability. This degradation is often caused by excessive changes in the representations, making it difficult to retain information learned during pre-training. Existing approaches, such as regularizing weight changes during fine-tuning, may fail to maintain sufficiently high feature similarity with the pre-trained model, and thus could possibly lose cross-task generalization. To address this issue, we propose Speech-FT, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework designed to maintain cross-task generalization while benefiting from fine-tuning. Speech-FT first applies fine-tuning specifically designed to reduce representational drift, followed by weight-space interpolation with the pre-trained model to restore cross-task generalization. Extensive experiments on HuBERT, wav2vec 2.0, DeCoAR 2.0, and WavLM Base+ demonstrate that Speech-FT consistently improves performance across a wide range of supervised, unsupervised, and multitask fine-tuning scenarios. Moreover, Speech-FT achieves superior cross-task generalization compared to fine-tuning baselines that explicitly constrain weight changes, such as weight-space regularization and LoRA fine-tuning. Our analysis reveals that Speech-FT maintains higher feature similarity to the pre-trained model compared to alternative strategies, despite allowing larger weight-space updates. Notably, Speech-FT achieves significant improvements on the SUPERB benchmark. For example, when fine-tuning HuBERT on automatic speech recognition, Speech-FT is able to reduce phone error rate from 5.17% to 3.94%, lower word error rate from 6.38% to 5.75%, and increase speaker identification accuracy from 81.86% to 84.11%. Speech-FT provides a simple yet powerful solution for further refining speech representation models after pre-training.

Abstract: We introduce Fraud-R1, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to defend against internet fraud and phishing in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Fraud-R1 comprises 8,564 fraud cases sourced from phishing scams, fake job postings, social media, and news, categorized into 5 major fraud types. Unlike previous benchmarks, Fraud-R1 introduces a multi-round evaluation pipeline to assess LLMs' resistance to fraud at different stages, including credibility building, urgency creation, and emotional manipulation. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 LLMs under two settings: 1. Helpful-Assistant, where the LLM provides general decision-making assistance, and 2. Role-play, where the model assumes a specific persona, widely used in real-world agent-based interactions. Our evaluation reveals the significant challenges in defending against fraud and phishing inducement, especially in role-play settings and fake job postings. Additionally, we observe a substantial performance gap between Chinese and English, underscoring the need for improved multilingual fraud detection capabilities.

<title>Conditioning LLMs to Generate Code-Switched Text</title>

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) is still a critical challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and generate code-switched text, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale CS datasets for training. This paper presents a novel methodology to generate CS data using LLMs, and test it on the English-Spanish language pair. We propose back-translating natural CS sentences into monolingual English, and using the resulting parallel corpus to fine-tune LLMs to turn monolingual sentences into CS. Unlike previous approaches to CS generation, our methodology uses natural CS data as a starting point, allowing models to learn its natural distribution beyond grammatical patterns. We thoroughly analyse the models' performance through a study on human preferences, a qualitative error analysis and an evaluation with popular automatic metrics. Results show that our methodology generates fluent code-switched text, expanding research opportunities in CS communication, and that traditional metrics do not correlate with human judgement when assessing the quality of the generated CS data. We release our code and generated dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license.

<title>Natural Language Generation from Visual Events: Challenges and Future Directions</title>

Abstract: The ability to use natural language to talk about visual events is at the core of human intelligence and a crucial feature of any artificial intelligence system. In recent years, a substantial body of work in visually grounded NLP has focused on describing content depicted in single images. By contrast, comparatively less attention has been devoted to exhaustively modeling scenarios in which natural language is employed to interpret and talk about events presented through videos or sequences of images. In this position paper, we argue that any NLG task dealing with sequences of images or frames is an instance of the broader, more general problem of modeling the intricate relationships between visual events unfolding over time and the features of the language used to interpret, describe, or narrate them. Therefore, solving these tasks requires models to be capable of identifying and managing such intricacies. We consider five seemingly different tasks, which we argue are compelling instances of this broader multimodal problem. Consistently, we claim that these tasks pose a common set of challenges and share similarities in terms of modeling and evaluation approaches. Building on this perspective, we identify key open questions and propose several research directions for future investigation. We claim that improving language-and-vision models' understanding of visual events is both timely and essential, given their growing applications. Additionally, this challenge offers significant scientific insight, advancing model development through principles of human cognition and language use.

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly explored to deliver personalized knowledge in areas such as language learning and science education. However, their capabilities in guiding users to solve complex real-world tasks remain underexplored. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on coding tutoring, a challenging problem that requires tutors to proactively guide students towards completing predefined coding tasks. We propose a novel agent workflow, Trace-and-Verify (TRAVER), which combines knowledge tracing to estimate a student's knowledge state and turn-by-turn verification to ensure effective guidance toward task completion. We introduce DICT, an automatic evaluation protocol that assesses tutor agents using controlled student simulation and code generation tests. Extensive experiments reveal the challenges of coding tutoring and demonstrate that TRAVER achieves a significantly higher success rate. Although we use code tutoring as an example in this paper, our approach can be extended beyond coding, providing valuable insights into advancing tutoring agents for human task learning.

<title>iAgent: LLM Agent as a Shield between User and Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems usually take the user-platform paradigm, where users are directly exposed under the control of the platform's recommendation algorithms. However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.

<title>A Tale of Two Structures: Do LLMs Capture the Fractal Complexity of Language?</title>

Abstract: Language exhibits a fractal structure in its information-theoretic complexity (i.e. bits per token), with self-similarity across scales and long-range dependence (LRD). In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can replicate such fractal characteristics and identify conditions-such as temperature setting and prompting method-under which they may fail. Moreover, we find that the fractal parameters observed in natural language are contained within a narrow range, whereas those of LLMs' output vary widely, suggesting that fractal parameters might prove helpful in detecting a non-trivial portion of LLM-generated texts. Notably, these findings, and many others reported in this work, are robust to the choice of the architecture; e.g. Gemini 1.0 Pro, Mistral-7B and Gemma-2B. We also release a dataset comprising of over 240,000 articles generated by various LLMs (both pretrained and instruction-tuned) with different decoding temperatures and prompting methods, along with their corresponding human-generated texts. We hope that this work highlights the complex interplay between fractal properties, prompting, and statistical mimicry in LLMs, offering insights for generating, evaluating and detecting synthetic texts.

Abstract: We study the use of large language models (LLMs) to both evaluate and greenwash corporate climate disclosures. First, we investigate the use of the LLM-as-a-Judge (LLMJ) methodology for scoring company-submitted reports on emissions reduction targets and progress. Second, we probe the behavior of an LLM when it is prompted to greenwash a response subject to accuracy and length constraints. Finally, we test the robustness of the LLMJ methodology against responses that may be greenwashed using an LLM. We find that two LLMJ scoring systems, numerical rating and pairwise comparison, are effective in distinguishing high-performing companies from others, with the pairwise comparison system showing greater robustness against LLM-greenwashed responses.

<title>Does Reasoning Introduce Bias? A Study of Social Bias Evaluation and Mitigation in LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automatic generation of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, leading to strong performance on tasks such as math and code. However, when reasoning steps reflect social stereotypes (e.g., those related to gender, race or age), they can reinforce harmful associations and lead to misleading conclusions. We present the first systematic evaluation of social bias within LLM-generated reasoning, using the BBQ dataset to analyze both prediction accuracy and bias. Our study spans a wide range of mainstream reasoning models, including instruction-tuned and CoT-augmented variants of DeepSeek-R1 (8B/32B), ChatGPT, and other open-source LLMs. We quantify how biased reasoning steps correlate with incorrect predictions and often lead to stereotype expression. To mitigate reasoning-induced bias, we propose Answer Distribution as Bias Proxy (ADBP), a lightweight mitigation method that detects bias by tracking how model predictions change across incremental reasoning steps. ADBP outperforms a stereotype-free baseline in most cases, mitigating bias and improving the accuracy of LLM outputs. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used, but they often generate subtle factual errors, especially in long-form text. These errors are fatal in some specialized domains such as medicine. Existing fact-checking with grounding documents methods face two main challenges: (1) they struggle to understand complex multihop relations in long documents, often overlooking subtle factual errors; (2) most specialized methods rely on pairwise comparisons, requiring multiple model calls, leading to high resource and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose GraphCheck, a fact-checking framework that uses extracted knowledge graphs to enhance text representation. Graph Neural Networks further process these graphs as a soft prompt, enabling LLMs to incorporate structured knowledge more effectively. Enhanced with graph-based reasoning, GraphCheck captures multihop reasoning chains that are often overlooked by existing methods, enabling precise and efficient fact-checking in a single inference call. Experimental results on seven benchmarks spanning both general and medical domains demonstrate up to a 7.1% overall improvement over baseline models. Notably, GraphCheck outperforms existing specialized fact-checkers and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art LLMs, such as DeepSeek-V3 and OpenAI-o1, with significantly fewer parameters.

<title>CORAL: Learning Consistent Representations across Multi-step Training with Lighter Speculative Drafter</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful technique that accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by leveraging a lightweight speculative draft model. However, existing designs suffers in performance due to misalignment between training and inference. Recent methods have tried to solve this issue by adopting a multi-step training strategy, but the complex inputs of different training steps make it harder for the draft model to converge. To address this, we propose CORAL, a novel framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency in speculative drafting. CORAL introduces Cross-Step Representation Alignment, a method that enhances consistency across multiple training steps, significantly improving speculative drafting performance. Additionally, we identify the LM head as a major bottleneck in the inference speed of the draft model. We introduce a weight-grouping mechanism that selectively activates a subset of LM head parameters during inference, substantially reducing the latency of the draft model. We evaluate CORAL on three LLM families and three benchmark datasets, achieving speedup ratios of 2.50x-4.07x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as EAGLE-2 and HASS. Our results demonstrate that CORAL effectively mitigates training-inference misalignment and delivers significant speedup for modern LLMs with large vocabularies.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, most RM research is centered on English and relies heavily on synthetic resources, which leads to limited and less reliable datasets and benchmarks for Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce CheemsBench, a fully human-annotated RM evaluation benchmark within Chinese contexts, and CheemsPreference, a large-scale and diverse preference dataset annotated through human-machine collaboration to support Chinese RM training. We systematically evaluate open-source discriminative and generative RMs on CheemsBench and observe significant limitations in their ability to capture human preferences in Chinese scenarios. Additionally, based on CheemsPreference, we construct an RM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CheemsBench, demonstrating the necessity of human supervision in RM training. Our findings reveal that scaled AI-generated data struggles to fully capture human preferences, emphasizing the importance of high-quality human supervision in RM development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, CoT prompting greatly increases computational demands, which has prompted growing interest in distilling CoT capabilities into Small Language Models (SLMs). This study systematically examines the factors influencing CoT distillation, including the choice of granularity, format and teacher model. Through experiments involving four teacher models and seven student models across seven mathematical and commonsense reasoning datasets, we uncover three key findings: (1) Unlike LLMs, SLMs exhibit a non-monotonic relationship with granularity, with stronger models benefiting from finer-grained reasoning and weaker models performing better with simpler CoT supervision; (2) CoT format significantly impacts LLMs but has minimal effect on SLMs, likely due to their reliance on supervised fine-tuning rather than pretraining preferences; (3) Stronger teacher models do NOT always produce better student models, as diversity and complexity in CoT supervision can outweigh accuracy alone. These findings emphasize the need to tailor CoT strategies to specific student model, offering actionable insights for optimizing CoT distillation in SLMs. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/Distilling-CoT-Reasoning.

Abstract: The surge of LLM studies makes synthesizing their findings challenging. Analysis of experimental results from literature can uncover important trends across studies, but the time-consuming nature of manual data extraction limits its use. Our study presents a semi-automated approach for literature analysis that accelerates data extraction using LLMs. It automatically identifies relevant arXiv papers, extracts experimental results and related attributes, and organizes them into a structured dataset, LLMEvalDB. We then conduct an automated literature analysis of frontier LLMs, reducing the effort of paper surveying and data extraction by more than 93% compared to manual approaches. We validate LLMEvalDB by showing that it reproduces key findings from a recent manual analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and also uncovers new insights that go beyond it, showing, for example, that in-context examples benefit coding & multimodal tasks but offer limited gains in math reasoning tasks compared to zero-shot CoT. Our automatically updatable dataset enables continuous tracking of target models by extracting evaluation studies as new data becomes available. Through LLMEvalDB and empirical analysis, we provide insights into LLMs while facilitating ongoing literature analyses of their behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to align their responses with objective facts, resulting in the issue of factual hallucinations, which can be difficult to detect and mislead users without relevant knowledge. Although post-training techniques have been employed to mitigate the issue, existing methods usually suffer from poor generalization and trade-offs in different capabilities. In this paper, we propose to address it by directly augmenting LLM's fundamental ability to precisely leverage its knowledge and introduce PKUE, which fine-tunes the model on self-generated responses to precise and simple factual questions through preference optimization. Furthermore, we construct FactualBench, a comprehensive and precise factual QA dataset containing 181k Chinese data spanning 21 domains, to facilitate both evaluation and training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PKUE significantly improves LLM overall performance, with consistent enhancement across factual tasks of various forms, general tasks beyond factuality, and tasks in a different language.

Abstract: How to align large language models (LLMs) with user preferences from a static general dataset has been frequently studied. However, user preferences are usually personalized, changing, and diverse regarding culture, values, or time. This leads to the problem that the actual user preferences often do not coincide with those trained by the model developers in the practical use of LLMs. Since we cannot collect enough data and retrain for every demand, researching efficient real-time preference adaptation methods based on the backbone LLMs during test time is important. To this end, we introduce Amulet, a novel, training-free framework that formulates the decoding process of every token as a separate online learning problem with the guidance of simple user-provided prompts, thus enabling real-time optimization to satisfy users' personalized preferences. To reduce the computational cost brought by this optimization process for each token, we additionally provide a closed-form solution for each iteration step of the optimization process, thereby reducing the computational time cost to a negligible level. The detailed experimental results demonstrate that Amulet can achieve significant performance improvements in rich settings with combinations of different LLMs, datasets, and user preferences, while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.

Abstract: Despite recent breakthroughs in reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1, incorporating inference-time reasoning into machine translation (MT), where human translators naturally employ structured, multi-layered reasoning chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), is yet underexplored. Existing methods either design a fixed CoT tailored for a specific MT sub-task (e.g., literature translation), or rely on synthesizing CoTs unaligned with humans and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) prone to overfitting, limiting their adaptability to diverse translation scenarios. This paper introduces R1-Translator (R1-T1), a novel framework to achieve inference-time reasoning for general MT via reinforcement learning (RL) with human-aligned CoTs comprising six common patterns. Our approach pioneers three innovations: (1) extending reasoning-based translation to broader MT scenarios (e.g., multilingual MT, domain MT) unseen in the training phase; (2) formalizing six expert-curated CoT templates that mirror hybrid human strategies like context-aware paraphrasing and back translation; and (3) enabling self-evolving CoT discovery through RL. Both human and automatic evaluation results indicate a steady translation performance improvement in a total of 10+ languages and 40+ translation directions on Flores-101 test set and four domain-specific MT tasks, especially on the languages unseen from training.

Abstract: Regular updates are essential for maintaining up-to-date knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Consequently, various model editing methods have been developed to update specific knowledge within LLMs. However, training-based approaches often struggle to effectively incorporate new knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Geometric Knowledge Editing (GeoEdit). GeoEdit utilizes the geometric relationships of parameter updates from fine-tuning to differentiate between neurons associated with new knowledge updates and those related to general knowledge perturbations. By employing a direction-aware knowledge identification method, we avoid updating neurons with directions approximately orthogonal to existing knowledge, thus preserving the model's generalization ability. For the remaining neurons, we integrate both old and new knowledge for aligned directions and apply a "forget-then-learn" editing strategy for opposite directions. Additionally, we introduce an importance-guided task vector fusion technique that filters out redundant information and provides adaptive neuron-level weighting, further enhancing model editing performance. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoEdit over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The ability to understand and predict the mental states of oneself and others, known as the Theory of Mind (ToM), is crucial for effective social scenarios. Although recent studies have evaluated ToM in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing benchmarks focus on simplified settings (e.g., Sally-Anne-style tasks) and overlook the complexity of real-world social interactions. To mitigate this gap, we propose PersuasiveToM, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ToM abilities of LLMs in persuasive dialogues. Our framework contains two core tasks: ToM Reasoning, which tests tracking of evolving desires, beliefs, and intentions; and ToM Application, which assesses the use of inferred mental states to predict and evaluate persuasion strategies. Experiments across eight leading LLMs reveal that while models excel on multiple questions, they struggle with the tasks that need tracking the dynamics and shifts of mental states and understanding the mental states in the whole dialogue comprehensively. Our aim with PersuasiveToM is to allow an effective evaluation of the ToM reasoning ability of LLMs with more focus on complex psychological activities. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Fangxu/PersuasiveToM.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) increases the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated text. Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns can hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres.
  By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an average of 19.78% higher AUROC compared to the best-performing existing detection method. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/detecting_llm_generated_korean_text_through_linguistic_analysis.

Abstract: Tool learning aims to augment large language models (LLMs) with diverse tools, enabling them to act as agents for solving practical tasks. Due to the limited context length of tool-using LLMs, adopting information retrieval (IR) models to select useful tools from large toolsets is a critical initial step. However, the performance of IR models in tool retrieval tasks remains underexplored and unclear. Most tool-use benchmarks simplify this step by manually pre-annotating a small set of relevant tools for each task, which is far from the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ToolRet, a heterogeneous tool retrieval benchmark comprising 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks, and a corpus of 43k tools, collected from existing datasets. We benchmark six types of models on ToolRet. Surprisingly, even the models with strong performance in conventional IR benchmarks, exhibit poor performance on ToolRet. This low retrieval quality degrades the task pass rate of tool-use LLMs. As a further step, we contribute a large-scale training dataset with over 200k instances, which substantially optimizes the tool retrieval ability of IR models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance across diverse domains but often suffer from overconfidence, limiting their reliability in critical applications. We propose SteerConf, a novel framework that systematically steers LLMs' confidence scores to improve their calibration and reliability. SteerConf introduces three key components: (1) a steering prompt strategy that guides LLMs to produce confidence scores in specified directions (e.g., conservative or optimistic) by leveraging prompts with varying steering levels; (2) a steered confidence consistency measure that quantifies alignment across multiple steered confidences to enhance calibration; and (3) a steered confidence calibration method that aggregates confidence scores using consistency measures and applies linear quantization for answer selection. SteerConf operates without additional training or fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable to existing LLMs. Experiments on seven benchmarks spanning professional knowledge, common sense, ethics, and reasoning tasks, using advanced LLM models (GPT-3.5, LLaMA 3, GPT-4), demonstrate that SteerConf significantly outperforms existing methods, often by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the potential of steering the confidence of LLMs to enhance their reliability for safer deployment in real-world applications.

<title>LINGOLY-TOO: Disentangling Memorisation from Knowledge with Linguistic Templatisation and Orthographic Obfuscation</title>

Abstract: The expanding knowledge and memorisation capacity of frontier language models allows them to solve many reasoning tasks directly by exploiting prior knowledge, leading to inflated estimates of their reasoning abilities. We introduce LINGOLY-TOO, a challenging reasoning benchmark grounded in natural language and designed to counteract the effect of non-reasoning abilities on reasoning estimates. Using linguistically informed rulesets, we permute reasoning problems written in real languages to generate numerous question variations. These permutations preserve the intrinsic reasoning steps required for each solution while reducing the likelihood problems are directly solvable with models' knowledge. Experiments and analyses show that models can circumvent reasoning and answer from prior knowledge. On a metric that rewards consistent reasoning, all models perform poorly and exhibit high variance across question permutations, indicating that Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning faculty remains brittle. Overall, results on the benchmark reflect the recent progress of Inference-Time Compute (ITC) models but suggest ample room for further improvement. The benchmark is a step towards better measurement of reasoning abilities of LLMs and offers a cautionary tale on the importance of disentangling reasoning abilities from models' internalised knowledge when developing reasoning benchmarks.

<title>Not-Just-Scaling Laws: Towards a Better Understanding of the Downstream Impact of Language Model Design Decisions</title>

Abstract: Improvements in language model capabilities are often attributed to increasing model size or training data, but in some cases smaller models trained on curated data or with different architectural decisions can outperform larger ones trained on more tokens. What accounts for this? To quantify the impact of these design choices, we meta-analyze 92 open-source pretrained models across a wide array of scales, including state-of-the-art open-weights models as well as less performant models and those with less conventional design decisions. We find that by incorporating features besides model size and number of training tokens, we can achieve a relative 3-28% increase in ability to predict downstream performance compared with using scale alone. Analysis of model design decisions reveal insights into data composition, such as the trade-off between language and code tasks at 15-25\% code, as well as the better performance of some architectural decisions such as choosing rotary over learned embeddings. Broadly, our framework lays a foundation for more systematic investigation of how model development choices shape final capabilities.

Abstract: Inference-time alignment provides an efficient alternative for aligning LLMs with humans. However, these approaches still face challenges, such as limited scalability due to policy-specific value functions and latency during the inference phase. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion-styled Preference Optimization (\model), which provides an efficient and policy-agnostic solution for aligning LLMs with humans. By directly performing alignment at sentence level, \model~avoids the time latency associated with token-level generation. Designed as a plug-and-play module, \model~can be seamlessly integrated with various base models to enhance their alignment. Extensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2, MT-bench, and HH-RLHF demonstrate that \model~achieves superior alignment performance across various settings, achieving a favorable trade-off between alignment quality and inference-time latency. Furthermore, \model~demonstrates model-agnostic scalability, significantly improving the performance of large models such as Llama-3-70B.

<title>One-Shot is Enough: Consolidating Multi-Turn Attacks into Efficient Single-Turn Prompts for LLMs</title>

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for consolidating multi-turn adversarial ``jailbreak'' prompts into single-turn queries, significantly reducing the manual overhead required for adversarial testing of large language models (LLMs). While multi-turn human jailbreaks have been shown to yield high attack success rates, they demand considerable human effort and time. Our multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) methods -- Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize -- systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts. Despite removing iterative back-and-forth interactions, these prompts preserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods achieve attack success rates from 70.6 percent to 95.9 percent across several state-of-the-art LLMs. Remarkably, the single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks by as much as 17.5 percentage points while cutting token usage by more than half on average. Further analysis shows that embedding malicious requests in enumerated or code-like structures exploits ``contextual blindness'', bypassing both native guardrails and external input-output filters. By converting multi-turn conversations into concise single-turn prompts, the M2S framework provides a scalable tool for large-scale red teaming and reveals critical weaknesses in contemporary LLM defenses.

<title>InftyThink: Breaking the Length Limits of Long-Context Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in large language models has achieved remarkable performance on challenging tasks, but the prevailing long-context reasoning paradigm faces critical limitations: quadratic computational scaling with sequence length, reasoning constrained by maximum context boundaries, and performance degradation beyond pre-training context windows. Existing approaches primarily compress reasoning chains without addressing the fundamental scaling problem. To overcome these challenges, we introduce InftyThink, a paradigm that transforms monolithic reasoning into an iterative process with intermediate summarization. By interleaving short reasoning segments with concise progress summaries, our approach enables unbounded reasoning depth while maintaining bounded computational costs. This creates a characteristic sawtooth memory pattern that significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, we develop a methodology for reconstructing long-context reasoning datasets into our iterative format, transforming OpenR1-Math into 333K training instances. Experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that our approach reduces computational costs while improving performance, with Qwen2.5-Math-7B showing 3-13% improvements across MATH500, AIME24, and GPQA_diamond benchmarks. Our work challenges the assumed trade-off between reasoning depth and computational efficiency, providing a more scalable approach to complex reasoning without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while serving as a viable complement to large language models (LLMs), often overlooks the crucial aspect of text chunking within its pipeline. This paper initially introduces a dual-metric evaluation method, comprising Boundary Clarity and Chunk Stickiness, to enable the direct quantification of chunking quality. Leveraging this assessment method, we highlight the inherent limitations of traditional and semantic chunking in handling complex contextual nuances, thereby substantiating the necessity of integrating LLMs into chunking process. To address the inherent trade-off between computational efficiency and chunking precision in LLM-based approaches, we devise the granularity-aware Mixture-of-Chunkers (MoC) framework, which consists of a three-stage processing mechanism. Notably, our objective is to guide the chunker towards generating a structured list of chunking regular expressions, which are subsequently employed to extract chunks from the original text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both our proposed metrics and the MoC framework effectively settle challenges of the chunking task, revealing the chunking kernel while enhancing the performance of the RAG system.

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM) evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on English, while current multilingual tasks lack parallel questions that specifically assess cross-linguistic reasoning abilities. This dual limitation makes it challenging to comprehensively assess LLMs' performance in the multilingual setting. To fill this gap, we introduce MMLU-ProX, a comprehensive benchmark covering 29 languages, built on an English benchmark. Each language version consists of 11,829 identical questions, enabling direct cross-linguistic comparisons. Additionally, to meet efficient evaluation needs, we provide a lite version containing 658 questions per language. To ensure the high quality of MMLU-ProX, we employ a rigorous development process that involves multiple powerful LLMs for translation, followed by expert review to ensure accurate expression, consistent terminology, and cultural relevance. Building on this, we systematically evaluate 36 state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced and multilingual-optimized LLMs. The results reveal significant disparities in the multilingual capabilities of LLMs: While they perform well in high-resource languages, their performance declines markedly in low-resource languages, with gaps of up to 24.3%. Through MMLU-ProX, we aim to advance the development of more inclusive AI systems and promote equitable access to technology across global contexts.

Abstract: NLP research has increasingly focused on subjective tasks such as emotion analysis. However, existing emotion benchmarks suffer from two major shortcomings: (1) they largely rely on keyword-based emotion recognition, overlooking crucial cultural dimensions required for deeper emotion understanding, and (2) many are created by translating English-annotated data into other languages, leading to potentially unreliable evaluation. To address these issues, we introduce Cultural Lenses on Emotion (CuLEmo), the first benchmark designed to evaluate culture-aware emotion prediction across six languages: Amharic, Arabic, English, German, Hindi, and Spanish. CuLEmo comprises 400 crafted questions per language, each requiring nuanced cultural reasoning and understanding. We use this benchmark to evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on culture-aware emotion prediction and sentiment analysis tasks. Our findings reveal that (1) emotion conceptualizations vary significantly across languages and cultures, (2) LLMs performance likewise varies by language and cultural context, and (3) prompting in English with explicit country context often outperforms in-language prompts for culture-aware emotion and sentiment understanding. The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available.

Abstract: Advanced table question answering (TableQA) methods prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate answer text, SQL query, Python code, or custom operations, which impressively improve the complex reasoning problems in the TableQA task. However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use the Formula as the executable representation for solving complex reasoning on tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct \texttt{FromulaQA}, a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset from existing datasets. In addition, we propose \texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables simultaneously. Unlike existing methods, \texttt{TabAF} decodes answers and Formulas with a single LLM backbone, demonstrating great versatility and generalization. \texttt{TabAF} based on Llama3.1-70B achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTableQuestion, HiTab, and TabFact.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieval models for identifying relevant contexts and answer generation models for utilizing those contexts. However, retrievers exhibit imperfect recall and precision, limiting downstream performance. We introduce RAG-RL, an answer generation model trained not only to produce answers but also to identify and cite relevant information from larger sets of retrieved contexts, shifting some of the burden of identifying relevant documents from the retriever to the answer generator. Our approach uses curriculum learning, where the model is first trained on easier examples that include only relevant contexts. Our experiments show that these training samples enable models to acquire citation and reasoning skills with greater sample efficiency and generalizability, demonstrating strong model performance even as the number of irrelevant passages increases. We benchmark our methods on three open-domain multi-hop question answering datasets and report significant gains in answer and citation accuracy. Our experiments provide empirical insights into how easier training samples can give models stronger signals for learning specific skills (e.g., citation generation) and how different components of post-training (e.g., training set construction, rule-based rewards, training sample ordering, etc.) impact final model performance.

Abstract: Current research on the \textit{Decompose-Then-Verify} paradigm for evaluating the factuality of long-form text typically treats decomposition and verification in isolation, overlooking their interactions and potential misalignment. We find that existing decomposition policies, typically hand-crafted demonstrations, do not align well with downstream verifiers in terms of atomicity -- a novel metric quantifying information density -- leading to suboptimal verification results. We formulate finding the optimal decomposition policy for optimal verification as a bilevel optimization problem. To approximate a solution for this strongly NP-hard problem, we propose dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims to verifier-preferred atomicity. Experimental results show that dynamic decomposition outperforms existing decomposition policies, improving verification confidence by 0.07 and accuracy by 0.12 (on a 0-1 scale) on average across varying verifiers, datasets, and atomcities of input claims.

Abstract: Recent research shows that LLMs can simulate ``believable'' human behaviors to power LLM agents via prompt-only methods. In this work, we focus on evaluating LLM's objective ``accuracy'' rather than the subjective ``believability'' in simulating human behavior, leveraging a large-scale, real-world dataset collected from customers' online shopping actions. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Llama, and Claude) on the task of web shopping action generation. Our results show that out-of-the-box LLM-generated actions are often misaligned with actual human behavior, whereas fine-tuning LLMs on real-world behavioral data substantially improves their ability to generate accurate actions compared to prompt-only methods. Furthermore, incorporating synthesized reasonings into model training leads to additional performance gains, demonstrating the value of explicit rationale in behavior modeling. This work evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs in behavior simulation and provides actionable insights into how real-world action data can enhance the fidelity of LLM agents.

Abstract: Beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables. In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.

Abstract: The rapid growth in the parameter size of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred the development of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods to mitigate the substantial computational costs of fine-tuning. Among these, Fisher Induced Sparse uncHanging (FISH) Mask is a selection-based PEFT technique that identifies a critical subset of pre-trained parameters using approximate Fisher information. While addition-based and reparameterization-based PEFT methods like LoRA and Adapter already fine-tune only a small number of parameters, the newly introduced parameters within these methods themselves present an opportunity for further optimization. Selectively fine-tuning only the most impactful among these new parameters could further reduce resource consumption while maintaining, or even improving, fine-tuning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FISH-Tuning}, a novel approach that incorporates FISH Mask into such PEFT methods, including LoRA, Adapter, and their variants. By leveraging Fisher information to identify and update only the most significant parameters within these added or reparameterized components, FISH-Tuning aims to achieve superior performance without increasing training time or inference latency compared to the vanilla PEFT methods. Experimental results across various datasets and pre-trained models demonstrate that FISH-Tuning consistently outperforms the vanilla PEFT methods when using the same proportion of trainable parameters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on standard benchmarks, yet they struggle increasingly from mode collapse, the inability to generate diverse and novel outputs. Our work introduces NoveltyBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of language models to produce multiple distinct and high-quality outputs. NoveltyBench utilizes prompts curated to elicit diverse answers and filtered real-world user queries. Evaluating 20 leading language models, we find that current state-of-the-art systems generate significantly less diversity than human writers. Notably, larger models within a family often exhibit less diversity than their smaller counterparts, challenging the notion that capability on standard benchmarks translates directly to generative utility. While prompting strategies like in-context regeneration can elicit diversity, our findings highlight a fundamental lack of distributional diversity in current models, reducing their utility for users seeking varied responses and suggesting the need for new training and evaluation paradigms that prioritize diversity alongside quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable across academia, industry, and daily applications, yet current evaluation methods struggle to keep pace with their rapid development. One core challenge of evaluation in the large language model (LLM) era is the generalization issue: how to infer a model's near-unbounded abilities from inevitably bounded benchmarks. We address this challenge by proposing Model Utilization Index (MUI), a mechanism interpretability enhanced metric that complements traditional performance scores. MUI quantifies the effort a model expends on a task, defined as the proportion of activated neurons or features during inference. Intuitively, a truly capable model should achieve higher performance with lower effort. Extensive experiments across popular LLMs reveal a consistent inverse logarithmic relationship between MUI and performance, which we formulate as the Utility Law. From this law we derive four practical corollaries that (i) guide training diagnostics, (ii) expose data contamination issue, (iii) enable fairer model comparisons, and (iv) design model-specific dataset diversity. Our code can be found at https://github.com/ALEX-nlp/MUI-Eva.

Abstract: We present a novel, open-source social network simulation framework, MOSAIC, where generative language agents predict user behaviors such as liking, sharing, and flagging content. This simulation combines LLM agents with a directed social graph to analyze emergent deception behaviors and gain a better understanding of how users determine the veracity of online social content. By constructing user representations from diverse fine-grained personas, our system enables multi-agent simulations that model content dissemination and engagement dynamics at scale. Within this framework, we evaluate three different content moderation strategies with simulated misinformation dissemination, and we find that they not only mitigate the spread of non-factual content but also increase user engagement. In addition, we analyze the trajectories of popular content in our simulations, and explore whether simulation agents' articulated reasoning for their social interactions truly aligns with their collective engagement patterns. We open-source our simulation software to encourage further research within AI and social sciences.

Abstract: Automated fact-checking (AFC) still falters on claims that are time-sensitive, entity-ambiguous, or buried beneath noisy search-engine results. We present PASS-FC, a Progressive and Adaptive Search Scheme for Fact Checking. Each atomic claim is first grounded with a precise time span and disambiguated entity descriptors. An adaptive search loop then issues structured queries, filters domains through credible-source selection, and expands queries cross-lingually; when necessary, a lightweight reflection routine restarts the loop. Experiments on six benchmark--covering general knowledge, scientific literature, real-world events, and ten languages--show that PASS-FC consistently outperforms prior systems, even those powered by larger backbone LLMs. On the multilingual X-FACT set, performance of different languages partially correlates with typological closeness to English, and forcing the model to reason in low-resource languages degrades accuracy. Ablations highlight the importance of temporal grounding and the adaptive search scheme, while detailed analysis shows that cross-lingual retrieval contributes genuinely new evidence. Code and full results will be released to facilitate further research.

Abstract: TextArena is an open-source collection of competitive text-based games for training and evaluation of agentic behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs). It spans 57+ unique environments (including single-player, two-player, and multi-player setups) and allows for easy evaluation of model capabilities via an online-play system (against humans and other submitted models) with real-time TrueSkill scores. Traditional benchmarks rarely assess dynamic social skills such as negotiation, theory of mind, and deception, creating a gap that TextArena addresses. Designed with research, community and extensibility in mind, TextArena emphasizes ease of adding new games, adapting the framework, testing models, playing against the models, and training models. Detailed documentation of environments, games, leaderboard, and examples are available on https://github.com/LeonGuertler/TextArena and https://www.textarena.ai/.

<title>Empirical Evaluation of Knowledge Distillation from Transformers to Subquadratic Language Models</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a widely used technique for compressing large language models (LLMs), in which a smaller student model is trained to mimic a larger teacher model. Typically, both the teacher and student models are Transformer-based architectures, leveraging softmax attention for sequence modeling. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention during inference remains a significant bottleneck, motivating the exploration of subquadratic alternatives such as structured state-space models (SSMs), linear attention, and recurrent architectures. In this work, we systematically evaluate the transferability of knowledge distillation from a Transformer teacher model to eight subquadratic student architectures. Our study investigates which subquadratic model can most effectively approximate the teacher model's learned representations through knowledge distillation, and how different architectural design choices influence the training dynamics. We further investigate the impact of initialization strategies, such as matrix mixing and query-key-value (QKV) copying, on the adaptation process. Our empirical results on multiple NLP benchmarks provide insights into the trade-offs between efficiency and performance, highlighting key factors for successful knowledge transfer to subquadratic architectures.

Abstract: Large reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1 and Deepseek-R1 have recently attracted widespread attention due to their impressive task-solving abilities. However, the enormous model size and the generation of lengthy thought chains introduce significant reasoning costs and response latency. Existing methods for efficient reasoning mainly focus on reducing the number of model parameters or shortening the chain-of-thought length. In this paper, we introduce Speculative Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which reduces reasoning latency from another perspective by accelerated average reasoning speed through large and small model collaboration. SCoT conducts thought-level drafting using a lightweight draft model. Then it selects the best CoT draft and corrects the error cases with the target model. The proposed thinking behavior alignment improves the efficiency of drafting and the draft selection strategy maintains the prediction accuracy of the target model for complex tasks. Experimental results on GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, CollegeMath and Olympiad datasets show that SCoT reduces reasoning latency by 48\%$\sim$66\% and 21\%$\sim$49\% for Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B while achieving near-target-model-level performance.

Abstract: Lay summaries for scientific documents typically include explanations to help readers grasp sophisticated concepts or arguments. However, current automatic summarization methods do not explicitly model explanations, which makes it difficult to align the proportion of explanatory content with human-written summaries. In this paper, we present a plan-based approach that leverages discourse frameworks to organize summary generation and guide explanatory sentences by prompting responses to the plan. Specifically, we propose two discourse-driven planning strategies, where the plan is conditioned as part of the input or part of the output prefix, respectively. Empirical experiments on three lay summarization datasets show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of summary quality, and it enhances model robustness, controllability, and mitigates hallucination.

Abstract: We challenge the dominant focus on neural scaling laws and advocate for a paradigm shift toward downscaling in the development of large language models (LLMs). While scaling laws have provided critical insights into performance improvements through increasing model and dataset size, we emphasize the significant limitations of this approach, particularly in terms of computational inefficiency, environmental impact, and deployment constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic framework for downscaling LLMs that seeks to maintain performance while drastically reducing resource demands. This paper outlines practical strategies for transitioning away from traditional scaling paradigms, advocating for a more sustainable, efficient, and accessible approach to LLM development.

Abstract: Transformer models have established new benchmarks in natural language processing; however, their increasing depth results in substantial growth in parameter counts. While existing recurrent transformer methods address this issue by reprocessing layers multiple times, they often apply recurrence indiscriminately across entire blocks of layers. In this work, we investigate Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR), a more targeted approach that applies recurrence selectively to individual layers within a single forward pass. Our experiments show that allocating more iterations to earlier layers yields optimal results. These findings suggest that ILR offers a promising direction for optimizing recurrent structures in transformer architectures.

Abstract: Tree-search-based reasoning methods have significantly enhanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by facilitating the exploration of multiple intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., thoughts. However, these methods suffer from substantial inference latency, as they have to generate numerous reasoning thoughts, severely limiting LLM applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Speculative Search (SpecSearch) framework that significantly accelerates LLM reasoning by optimizing thought generation. Specifically, SpecSearch utilizes a small model to strategically collaborate with a large model at both thought and token levels, efficiently generating high-quality reasoning thoughts. The major pillar of SpecSearch is a novel quality-preserving rejection mechanism, which effectively filters out thoughts whose quality falls below that of the large model's outputs. Moreover, we show that SpecSearch preserves comparable reasoning quality to the large model. Experiments on both the Qwen and Llama models demonstrate that SpecSearch significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 2.12$\times$ speedup with comparable reasoning quality.

Abstract: We present AM-Thinking-v1, a 32B dense language model that advances the frontier of reasoning, embodying the collaborative spirit of open-source innovation. Outperforming DeepSeek-R1 and rivaling leading Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models like Qwen3-235B-A22B and Seed1.5-Thinking, AM-Thinking-v1 achieves impressive scores of 85.3 on AIME 2024, 74.4 on AIME 2025, and 70.3 on LiveCodeBench, showcasing state-of-the-art mathematical and coding capabilities among open-source models of similar scale.
  Built entirely from the open-source Qwen2.5-32B base model and publicly available queries, AM-Thinking-v1 leverages a meticulously crafted post-training pipeline - combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning - to deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities. This work demonstrates that the open-source community can achieve high performance at the 32B scale, a practical sweet spot for deployment and fine-tuning. By striking a balance between top-tier performance and real-world usability, we hope AM-Thinking-v1 inspires further collaborative efforts to harness mid-scale models, pushing reasoning boundaries while keeping accessibility at the core of innovation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce S-MedQA, an English medical question-answering (QA) dataset for benchmarking large language models in fine-grained clinical specialties. We use S-MedQA to check the applicability of a popular hypothesis related to knowledge injection in the knowledge-intense scenario of medical QA, and show that: 1) training on data from a speciality does not necessarily lead to best performance on that specialty and 2) regardless of the specialty fine-tuned on, token probabilities of clinically relevant terms for all specialties increase consistently. Thus, we believe improvement gains come mostly from domain shifting (e.g., general to medical) rather than knowledge injection and suggest rethinking the role of fine-tuning data in the medical domain. We release S-MedQA and all code needed to reproduce all our experiments to the research community.

Abstract: We present GeoGrid-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of foundation models to understand geo-spatial data in the grid structure. Geo-spatial datasets pose distinct challenges due to their dense numerical values, strong spatial and temporal dependencies, and unique multimodal representations including tabular data, heatmaps, and geographic visualizations. To assess how foundation models can support scientific research in this domain, GeoGrid-Bench features large-scale, real-world data covering 16 climate variables across 150 locations and extended time frames. The benchmark includes approximately 3,200 question-answer pairs, systematically generated from 8 domain expert-curated templates to reflect practical tasks encountered by human scientists. These range from basic queries at a single location and time to complex spatiotemporal comparisons across regions and periods. Our evaluation reveals that vision-language models perform best overall, and we provide a fine-grained analysis of the strengths and limitations of different foundation models in different geo-spatial tasks. This benchmark offers clearer insights into how foundation models can be effectively applied to geo-spatial data analysis and used to support scientific research.

Abstract: Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from basic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate human-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs; \textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs. Building on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a structured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers practitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure Computer-Using Agents.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.

Abstract: Editing presentation slides remains one of the most common and time-consuming tasks faced by millions of users daily, despite significant advances in automated slide generation. Existing approaches have successfully demonstrated slide editing via graphic user interface (GUI)-based agents, offering intuitive visual control. However, such methods often suffer from high computational cost and latency. In this paper, we propose Talk-to-Your-Slides, an LLM-powered agent designed to edit slides %in active PowerPoint sessions by leveraging structured information about slide objects rather than relying on image modality. The key insight of our work is designing the editing process with distinct high-level and low-level layers to facilitate interaction between user commands and slide objects. By providing direct access to application objects rather than screen pixels, our system enables 34.02% faster processing, 34.76% better instruction fidelity, and 87.42% cheaper operation than baselines. To evaluate slide editing capabilities, we introduce TSBench, a human-annotated dataset comprising 379 diverse editing instructions paired with corresponding slide variations in four categories. Our code, benchmark and demos are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Talk-to-Your-Slides-0F4C.

Abstract: Compressing long chain-of-thought (CoT) from large language models (LLMs) is an emerging strategy to improve the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. Despite its promising benefits, existing studies equally compress all thoughts within a long CoT, hindering more concise and effective reasoning. To this end, we first investigate the importance of different thoughts by examining their effectiveness and efficiency in contributing to reasoning through automatic long CoT chunking and Monte Carlo rollouts. Building upon the insights, we propose a theoretically bounded metric to jointly measure the effectiveness and efficiency of different thoughts. We then propose Long$\otimes$Short, an efficient reasoning framework that enables two LLMs to collaboratively solve the problem: a long-thought LLM for more effectively generating important thoughts, while a short-thought LLM for efficiently generating remaining thoughts. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a small amount of cold-start data to fine-tune LLMs for long-thought and short-thought reasoning styles, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a synergizing-oriented multi-turn reinforcement learning, focusing on the model self-evolution and collaboration between long-thought and short-thought LLMs. Experimental results show that our method enables Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B to achieve comparable performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, while reducing token length by over 80% across the MATH500, AIME24/25, AMC23, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.

Abstract: VLM-based mobile agents are increasingly popular due to their capabilities to interact with smartphone GUIs and XML-structured texts and to complete daily tasks. However, existing online benchmarks struggle with obtaining stable reward signals due to dynamic environmental changes. Offline benchmarks evaluate the agents through single-path trajectories, which stands in contrast to the inherently multi-solution characteristics of GUI tasks. Additionally, both types of benchmarks fail to assess whether mobile agents can handle noise or engage in proactive interactions due to a lack of noisy apps or overly full instructions during the evaluation process. To address these limitations, we use a slot-based instruction generation method to construct a more realistic and comprehensive benchmark named Mobile-Bench-v2. Mobile-Bench-v2 includes a common task split, with offline multi-path evaluation to assess the agent's ability to obtain step rewards during task execution. It contains a noisy split based on pop-ups and ads apps, and a contaminated split named AITZ-Noise to formulate a real noisy environment. Furthermore, an ambiguous instruction split with preset Q\&amp;A interactions is released to evaluate the agent's proactive interaction capabilities. We conduct evaluations on these splits using the single-agent framework AppAgent-v1, the multi-agent framework Mobile-Agent-v2, as well as other mobile agents such as UI-Tars and OS-Atlas. Code and data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/xwk123/MobileBench-v2.

<title>One-for-All Pruning: A Universal Model for Customized Compression of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Existing pruning methods for large language models (LLMs) focus on achieving high compression rates while maintaining model performance. Although these methods have demonstrated satisfactory performance in handling a single user's compression request, their processing time increases linearly with the number of requests, making them inefficient for real-world scenarios with multiple simultaneous requests. To address this limitation, we propose a Univeral Model for Customized Compression (UniCuCo) for LLMs, which introduces a StratNet that learns to map arbitrary requests to their optimal pruning strategy. The challenge in training StratNet lies in the high computational cost of evaluating pruning strategies and the non-differentiable nature of the pruning process, which hinders gradient backpropagation for StratNet updates. To overcome these challenges, we leverage a Gaussian process to approximate the evaluation process. Since the gradient of the Gaussian process is computable, we can use it to approximate the gradient of the non-differentiable pruning process, thereby enabling StratNet updates. Experimental results show that UniCuCo is 28 times faster than baselines in processing 64 requests, while maintaining comparable accuracy to baselines.

Abstract: We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions, leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models.

Moreover, their scalar outputs are difficult to interpret without contextual reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce R3, a novel reward modeling framework that is rubric-agnostic, generalizable across evaluation dimensions, and provides interpretable, reasoned score assignments. R3 enables more transparent and flexible evaluation of language models, supporting robust alignment with diverse human values and use cases.

Existing methods predominantly rely on pre-trained small language models (SLMs) to collect information related to aspects and sentiments from both image and text, with an aim to align these two modalities. However, small SLMs possess limited capacity and knowledge, often resulting in inaccurate identification of meaning, aspects, sentiments, and their interconnections in textual and visual data. On the other hand, Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in various tasks by effectively exploring fine-grained information in multimodal data. However, some studies indicate that LLMs still fall short compared to fine-tuned small models in the field of ABSA. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, termed LRSA, which combines the decision-making capabilities of SLMs with additional information provided by LLMs for MABSA. Specifically, we inject explanations generated by LLMs as rationales into SLMs and employ a dual cross-attention mechanism for enhancing feature interaction and fusion, thereby augmenting the SLMs' ability to identify aspects and sentiments. We evaluated our method using two baseline models, numerous experiments highlight the superiority of our approach on three widely-used benchmarks, indicating its generalizability and applicability to most pre-trained models for MABSA.

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) sometimes alter their behavior when they detect that they are being evaluated, an effect analogous to the Hawthorne phenomenon, which can lead them to optimize for test-passing performance or to comply more readily with harmful prompts if real-world consequences appear absent. We present the first quantitative study of how such "test awareness" impacts model behavior, particularly its safety alignment. We introduce a white-box probing framework that (i) linearly identifies awareness-related activations and (ii) steers models toward or away from test awareness while monitoring downstream performance. We apply our method to different state-of-the-art open-source reasoning LLMs across both realistic and hypothetical tasks. Our results demonstrate that test awareness significantly impact safety alignment, and is different for different models. By providing fine-grained control over this latent effect, our work aims to increase trust in how we perform safety evaluation.

<title>Towards End-to-End Training of Automatic Speech Recognition for Nigerian Pidgin</title>

Abstract: The prevalence of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in spoken language applications has increased significantly in recent years. Notably, many African languages lack sufficient linguistic resources to support the robustness of these systems. This paper focuses on the development of an end-to-end speech recognition system customized for Nigerian Pidgin English. We investigated and evaluated different pretrained state-of-the-art architectures on a new dataset. Our empirical results demonstrate a notable performance of the variant Wav2Vec2 XLSR-53 on our dataset, achieving a word error rate (WER) of 29.6% on the test set, surpassing other architectures such as NEMO QUARTZNET and Wav2Vec2.0 BASE-100H in quantitative assessments. Additionally, we demonstrate that pretrained state-of-the-art architectures do not work well out-of-the-box. We performed zero-shot evaluation using XLSR-English as the baseline, chosen for its similarity to Nigerian Pidgin. This yielded a higher WER of 73.7%. By adapting this architecture to nuances represented in our dataset, we reduce error by 59.84%. Our dataset comprises 4,288 recorded utterances from 10 native speakers, partitioned into training, validation, and test sets. This study underscores the potential for improving ASR systems for under-resourced languages like Nigerian Pidgin English, contributing to greater inclusion in speech technology applications. We publicly release our unique parallel dataset (speech-to-text) on Nigerian Pidgin, as well as the model weights on Hugging Face. Our code would be made available to foster future research from the community.

<title>GUARD: Role-playing to Generate Natural-language Jailbreakings to Test Guideline Adherence of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The discovery of "jailbreaks" to bypass safety filters of Large Language Models (LLMs) and harmful responses have encouraged the community to implement safety measures. One major safety measure is to proactively test the LLMs with jailbreaks prior to the release. Therefore, such testing will require a method that can generate jailbreaks massively and efficiently. In this paper, we follow a novel yet intuitive strategy to generate jailbreaks in the style of the human generation. We propose a role-playing system that assigns four different roles to the user LLMs to collaborate on new jailbreaks. Furthermore, we collect existing jailbreaks and split them into different independent characteristics using clustering frequency and semantic patterns sentence by sentence. We organize these characteristics into a knowledge graph, making them more accessible and easier to retrieve. Our system of different roles will leverage this knowledge graph to generate new jailbreaks, which have proved effective in inducing LLMs to generate unethical or guideline-violating responses. In addition, we also pioneer a setting in our system that will automatically follow the government-issued guidelines to generate jailbreaks to test whether LLMs follow the guidelines accordingly. We refer to our system as GUARD (Guideline Upholding through Adaptive Role-play Diagnostics). We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on three cutting-edge open-sourced LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, and Llama-2-7B), as well as a widely-utilized commercial LLM (ChatGPT). Moreover, our work extends to the realm of vision language models (MiniGPT-v2 and Gemini Vision Pro), showcasing GUARD's versatility and contributing valuable insights for the development of safer, more reliable LLM-based applications across diverse modalities.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks aim to bypass the LLMs' safeguards. While researchers have proposed different jailbreak attacks in depth, they have done so in isolation -- either with unaligned settings or comparing a limited range of methods. To fill this gap, we present a large-scale evaluation of various jailbreak attacks. We collect 17 representative jailbreak attacks, summarize their features, and establish a novel jailbreak attack taxonomy. Then we conduct comprehensive measurement and ablation studies across nine aligned LLMs on 160 forbidden questions from 16 violation categories. Also, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced defenses. Based on our taxonomy and experiments, we identify some important patterns, such as heuristic-based attacks could achieve high attack success rates but are easy to mitigate by defenses, causing low practicality. Our study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and defenses. We hope our work could help the community avoid incremental work and serve as an effective benchmark tool for practitioners.

<title>Query Performance Prediction using Relevance Judgments Generated by Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Query performance prediction (QPP) aims to estimate the retrieval quality of a search system for a query without human relevance judgments. Previous QPP methods typically return a single scalar value and do not require the predicted values to approximate a specific information retrieval (IR) evaluation measure, leading to certain drawbacks: (i) a single scalar is insufficient to accurately represent different IR evaluation measures, especially when metrics do not highly correlate, and (ii) a single scalar limits the interpretability of QPP methods because solely using a scalar is insufficient to explain QPP results. To address these issues, we propose a QPP framework using automatically generated relevance judgments (QPP-GenRE), which decomposes QPP into independent subtasks of predicting the relevance of each item in a ranked list to a given query. This allows us to predict any IR evaluation measure using the generated relevance judgments as pseudo-labels. This also allows us to interpret predicted IR evaluation measures, and identify, track and rectify errors in generated relevance judgments to improve QPP quality. We predict an item's relevance by using open-source large language models (LLMs) to ensure scientific reproducibility. We face two main challenges: (i) excessive computational costs of judging an entire corpus for predicting a metric considering recall, and (ii) limited performance in prompting open-source LLMs in a zero-/few-shot manner. To solve the challenges, we devise an approximation strategy to predict an IR measure considering recall and propose to fine-tune open-source LLMs using human-labeled relevance judgments. Experiments on the TREC 2019 to 2022 deep learning tracks and CAsT-19 and 20 datasets show that QPP-GenRE achieves state-of-the-art QPP quality for both lexical and neural rankers.

arXiv:2404.16792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the high computational cost of preference alignment training of large language models (LLMs), exploring efficient methods to reduce the training overhead remains an important and compelling research problem. Motivated by the observation that alignment training typically involves only small parameter changes without injecting new knowledge into models, we propose a straightforward method called ExPO (model extrapolation) to expedite LLMs' alignment with human preferences. Given a partially-trained model and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO improves the implicit optimization objective of alignment training by simply amplifying the parameter change based on a first-order approximation, without any additional training overhead. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that ExPO boosts a DPO model trained with only 20% steps to outperform the fully-trained one. Moreover, we show that ExPO notably improves existing open-source LLMs (ranging from 1.8B to 70B parameters) on the leading AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench benchmarks, which highlights ExPO's broader utility in efficiently enhancing LLM alignment.

Abstract: Many natural language processing systems operate over tokenizations of text to address the open-vocabulary problem. In this paper, we give and analyze an algorithm for the efficient construction of deterministic finite automata (DFA) designed to operate directly on tokenizations produced by the popular byte pair encoding (BPE) technique. This makes it possible to apply many existing techniques and algorithms to the tokenized case, such as pattern matching, equivalence checking of tokenization dictionaries, and composing tokenized languages in various ways. The construction preserves some key properties of the automaton, and we use this to establish asymptotic bounds on the state complexity of the automata that result. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct an input-deterministic (subsequential) string-to-string transducer which precisely describes the relationship between strings and their correct tokenizations.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLM) in clinical scenarios is crucial to assessing their potential clinical utility. Existing benchmarks rely heavily on static question-answering, which does not accurately depict the complex, sequential nature of clinical decision-making. Here, we introduce AgentClinic, a multimodal agent benchmark for evaluating LLMs in simulated clinical environments that include patient interactions, multimodal data collection under incomplete information, and the usage of various tools, resulting in an in-depth evaluation across nine medical specialties and seven languages. We find that solving MedQA problems in the sequential decision-making format of AgentClinic is considerably more challenging, resulting in diagnostic accuracies that can drop to below a tenth of the original accuracy. Overall, we observe that agents sourced from Claude-3.5 outperform other LLM backbones in most settings. Nevertheless, we see stark differences in the LLMs' ability to make use of tools, such as experiential learning, adaptive retrieval, and reflection cycles. Strikingly, Llama-3 shows up to 92% relative improvements with the notebook tool that allows for writing and editing notes that persist across cases. To further scrutinize our clinical simulations, we leverage real-world electronic health records, perform a clinical reader study, perturb agents with biases, and explore novel patient-centric metrics that this interactive environment firstly enables.

<title>SliM-LLM: Salience-Driven Mixed-Precision Quantization for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique for compressing large language models (LLMs). However, while uniform-precision quantization is computationally efficient, it often compromises model performance. To address this, we propose SliM-LLM, a salience-driven mixed-precision quantization framework that allocates bit-widths at the group-wise. Our approach leverages the observation that important weights follow a structured distribution and introduces two key components: \textbf{1)} \textit{Salience-Determined Bit Allocation} adaptively assigns bit-widths to groups within each layer based on their salience; and \textbf{2)} \textit{Salience-Weighted Quantizer Calibration} optimizes quantizer parameters by incorporating element-level salience. With its structured partitioning, SliM-LLM provides a hardware-friendly solution that matches the efficiency of uniform quantization methods while improving accuracy. Experiments show that SliM-LLM achieves superior performance across various LLMs at low bit-widths. For example, a 2-bit quantized LLaMA-7B model reduces memory usage by nearly 6x compared to the floating-point baseline, decreases perplexity by 48\% compared to state-of-the-art gradient-free PTQ methods, and maintains GPU inference speed. Additionally, the extended version, SliM-LLM$^+$, which incorporates gradient-based quantization, further reduces perplexity by 35.1\%.

<title>Explaining the role of Intrinsic Dimensionality in Adversarial Training</title>

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) impacts different architectures in distinct ways: vision models gain robustness but face reduced generalization, encoder-based models exhibit limited robustness improvements with minimal generalization loss, and recent work in latent-space adversarial training (LAT) demonstrates that decoder-based models achieve improved robustness by applying AT across multiple layers. We provide the first explanation for these trends by leveraging the manifold conjecture: off-manifold adversarial examples (AEs) enhance robustness, while on-manifold AEs improve generalization. We show that vision and decoder-based models exhibit low intrinsic dimensionality in earlier layers (favoring off-manifold AEs), whereas encoder-based models do so in later layers (favoring on-manifold AEs). Exploiting this property, we introduce SMAAT, which improves the scalability of AT for encoder-based models by perturbing the layer with the lowest intrinsic dimensionality. This reduces the projected gradient descent (PGD) chain length required for AE generation, cutting GPU time by 25-33% while significantly boosting robustness. We validate SMAAT across multiple tasks, including text generation, sentiment classification, safety filtering, and retrieval augmented generation setups, demonstrating superior robustness with comparable generalization to standard training.

Abstract: As Visual Language Models (VLMs) become increasingly embedded in everyday applications, ensuring they can recognize and appropriately handle privacy-sensitive content is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art VLMs and identify limitations in their understanding of visual privacy. Existing datasets suffer from label inconsistencies, limiting their reliability. To address this, we introduce two compact, high-quality benchmarks, PrivBench and PrivBench-H, that focus on commonly recognized privacy categories aligned with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Additionally, we present PrivTune, an instruction-tuning dataset specifically curated to improve privacy sensitivity. We obtain a Privacy VLM by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf VLM on only 100 samples from PrivTune, which leads to substantial gains on all benchmarks, surpassing GPT-4, while maintaining strong performance on other tasks. Our findings show that privacy-awareness in VLMs can be substantially improved with minimal data and careful dataset design, setting the stage for safer, more privacy-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, marks a significant step toward artificial general intelligence. Existing methods typically align vision encoders with LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but this often deteriorates their ability to handle multiple languages as training progresses. We empirically observe that imbalanced SFT datasets, largely English-centric, degrade performance on non-English languages due to the failure in multilingual token alignment. To address this, we propose PARROT, a novel approach that leverages textual guidance for visual token alignment at the language level. PARROT conditions visual tokens on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to align multilingual tokens. By computing cross-attention between initial visual features and textual embeddings, we select the most relevant experts, converting visual tokens into language-specific representations. Additionally, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark (MMMB), a new benchmark comprising 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, to assess multilingual capabilities. PARROT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the multilingual benchmarks and a wide range of multimodal tasks. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Parrot

Abstract: Important tasks such as reasoning and planning are fundamentally algorithmic, meaning that solving them robustly requires acquiring true reasoning or planning algorithms, rather than shortcuts. Large Language Models lack true algorithmic ability primarily because of the limitations of neural network optimization algorithms, their optimization data and optimization objective, but also due to architectural inexpressivity. To solve this, our paper proposes augmenting LLMs with a library of fundamental operations and sophisticated differentiable programs, so that common algorithms do not need to be learned from scratch. We add memory, registers, basic operations, and adaptive recurrence to a transformer architecture built on LLaMA3. Then, we define a method for directly compiling algorithms into a differentiable starting library, which is used natively and propagates gradients for optimization. In this preliminary study, we explore the feasability of augmenting LLaMA3 with a differentiable computer, for instance by fine-tuning small transformers on simple algorithmic tasks with variable computational depth.

Abstract: The Explainable Recommendation task is designed to receive a pair of user and item and output explanations to justify why an item is recommended to a user. Many models approach review generation as a proxy for explainable recommendations. While these models can produce fluent and grammatically correct sentences, they often lack precision and fail to provide personalized, informative recommendations. To address this issue, we propose a personalized, aspect-controlled model called Multi-Aspect Prompt LEarner (MAPLE), which integrates aspect category as another input dimension to facilitate memorizing fine-grained aspect terms. Experiments conducted on two real-world review datasets in the restaurant domain demonstrate that MAPLE significantly outperforms baseline review-generation models. MAPLE excels in both text and feature diversity, ensuring that the generated content covers a wide range of aspects. Additionally, MAPLE delivers good generation quality while maintaining strong coherence and factual relevance. The code and dataset used in this paper can be found here https://github.com/Nana2929/MAPLE.git.

Abstract: Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional and intentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions. Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is an efficient prompting method that enables the reasoning ability of large language models by augmenting the query using multiple examples with multiple intermediate steps. Despite the empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how to train a Transformer to achieve the CoT ability remains less explored. This is primarily due to the technical challenges involved in analyzing the nonconvex optimization on nonlinear attention models. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first theoretical study of training Transformers with nonlinear attention to obtain the CoT generalization capability so that the resulting model can inference on unseen tasks when the input is augmented by examples of the new task. We first quantify the required training samples and iterations to train a Transformer model towards CoT ability. We then prove the success of its CoT generalization on unseen tasks with distribution-shifted testing data. Moreover, we theoretically characterize the conditions for an accurate reasoning output by CoT even when the provided reasoning examples contain noises and are not always accurate. In contrast, in-context learning (ICL), which can be viewed as one-step CoT without intermediate steps, may fail to provide an accurate output when CoT does. These theoretical findings are justified through experiments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of scientific progress requires innovative tools that can accelerate knowledge discovery. Although recent AI methods, particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown promise in tasks such as hypothesis generation and experimental design, they fall short of replicating the collaborative nature of real-world scientific practices, where diverse experts work together in teams to tackle complex problems. To address the limitations, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent system, i.e., Virtual Scientists (VirSci), designed to mimic the teamwork inherent in scientific research. VirSci organizes a team of agents to collaboratively generate, evaluate, and refine research ideas. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that this multi-agent approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing novel scientific ideas. We further investigate the collaboration mechanisms that contribute to its tendency to produce ideas with higher novelty, offering valuable insights to guide future research and illuminating pathways toward building a robust system for autonomous scientific discovery.

Abstract: Autonomy via agents using large language models (LLMs) for personalized, standardized tasks boosts human efficiency. Automating web tasks (like booking hotels within a budget) is increasingly sought after. Fulfilling practical needs, the web agent also serves as an important proof-of-concept example for various agent grounding scenarios, with its success promising advancements in many future applications. Prior research often handcrafts web agent strategies (e.g., prompting templates, multi-agent systems, search methods, etc.) and the corresponding in-context examples, which may not generalize well across all real-world scenarios. On the other hand, there has been limited study on the misalignment between a web agent's observation/action representation and the pre-training data of the LLM it's based on. This discrepancy is especially notable when LLMs are primarily trained for language completion rather than tasks involving embodied navigation actions and symbolic web elements. Our study enhances an LLM-based web agent by simply refining its observation and action space to better align with the LLM's capabilities. This approach enables our base agent to significantly outperform previous methods on a wide variety of web tasks. Specifically, on WebArena, a benchmark featuring general-purpose web interaction tasks, our agent AgentOccam surpasses the previous state-of-the-art and concurrent work by 9.8 (+29.4%) and 5.9 (+15.8%) absolute points respectively, and boosts the success rate by 26.6 points (+161%) over similar plain web agents with its observation and action space alignment. We achieve this without using in-context examples, new agent roles, online feedback or search strategies. AgentOccam's simple design highlights LLMs' impressive zero-shot performance on web tasks, and underlines the critical role of carefully tuning observation and action spaces for LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various fields, their potential to generate untruthful, biased and harmful responses poses significant risks, particularly in critical applications. This highlights the urgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior. While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses, this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based on causality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematically monitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference, operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently when misbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokens and transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in the causal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling the development of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehavior detection tasks.

<title>Automated Trustworthiness Oracle Generation for Machine Learning Text Classifiers</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) for text classification has been widely used in various domains. These applications can significantly impact ethics, economics, and human behavior, raising serious concerns about trusting ML decisions. Studies indicate that conventional metrics are insufficient to build human trust in ML models. These models often learn spurious correlations and predict based on them. In the real world, their performance can deteriorate significantly. To avoid this, a common practice is to test whether predictions are reasonable based on valid patterns in the data. Along with this, a challenge known as the trustworthiness oracle problem has been introduced. Due to the lack of automated trustworthiness oracles, the assessment requires manual validation of the decision process disclosed by explanation methods. However, this is time-consuming, error-prone, and unscalable.
  We propose TOKI, the first automated trustworthiness oracle generation method for text classifiers. TOKI automatically checks whether the words contributing the most to a prediction are semantically related to the predicted class. Specifically, we leverage ML explanations to extract the decision-contributing words and measure their semantic relatedness with the class based on word embeddings. We also introduce a novel adversarial attack method that targets trustworthiness vulnerabilities identified by TOKI. To evaluate their alignment with human judgement, experiments are conducted. We compare TOKI with a naive baseline based solely on model confidence and TOKI-guided adversarial attack method with A2T, a SOTA adversarial attack method. Results show that relying on prediction uncertainty cannot effectively distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy predictions, TOKI achieves 142% higher accuracy than the naive baseline, and TOKI-guided attack method is more effective with fewer perturbations than A2T.

<title>P$^2$ Law: Scaling Law for Post-Training After Model Pruning</title>

Abstract: Pruning has become a widely adopted technique for reducing the hardware requirements of large language models (LLMs). To recover model performance after pruning, post-training is commonly employed to mitigate the resulting performance degradation. While post-training benefits from larger datasets, once the dataset size is already substantial, increasing the training data provides only limited performance gains. To balance post-training cost and model performance, it is necessary to explore the optimal amount of post-training data.Through extensive experiments on the Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 series models, pruned using various common pruning methods, we uncover the scaling \textbf{Law} for \textbf{P}ost-training after model \textbf{P}runing, referred to as the P$^2$ Law.This law identifies four key factors for predicting the pruned model's post-training loss: the model size before pruning, the number of post-training tokens, the pruning rate, and the model's loss before pruning. Moreover, P$^2$ Law can generalize to larger dataset sizes, larger model sizes, and higher pruning rates, offering valuable insights for the post-training of pruned LLMs.

<title>FuseGPT: Learnable Layers Fusion of Generative Pre-trained Transformers</title>

Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains, largely due to the extensive scaling of model parameters. Recent works have observed redundancy within transformer blocks and developed compression methods by structured pruning of less important blocks. However, such direct removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation. In this paper, we propose FuseGPT, a novel methodology designed to recycle pruned transformer blocks, thereby recovering the model's performance. Firstly, we introduce a new importance detection metric, Macro Influence (MI), which evaluates the long-term impact of each transformer block by quantifying the information loss incurred upon its removal. Next, we propose group-level layer fusion, which leverages the parameters from layers of less important blocks and integrates them into the corresponding layers of neighboring blocks. This fusion process is not a one-time operation but is refined through iterative parameter updates by lightweight group-level fine-tuning. Specifically, the injected parameters are frozen but are weighted with learnable rank decomposition matrices to reduce the computational overhead during fine-tuning. Our approach not only works well for large language models but also for large multimodal models. Experimental results indicate that, even with modest amounts of data, FuseGPT surpasses previous methods in both perplexity and zero-shot task performance.

Abstract: LLMs exhibit advanced reasoning capabilities, offering the potential to transform natural language questions into mathematical models. However, existing open-source datasets in operations research domain lack detailed annotations of the modeling process, such as variable definitions, focusing solely on objective values, which hinders reinforcement learning applications. To address this, we release the StructuredOR dataset, annotated with comprehensive labels that capture the complete mathematical modeling process. We further propose BPP-Search, an algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning into a tree-of-thought structure using Beam search, a Process reward model, and a pairwise Preference algorithm. This approach enables efficient exploration of tree structures, avoiding exhaustive search while improving accuracy. Extensive experiments on StructuredOR, NL4OPT, and MAMO-ComplexLP datasets show that BPP-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In tree-based reasoning, BPP-Search excels in accuracy and efficiency, enabling faster retrieval of correct solutions. The StructuredOR dataset is available on Huggingface https://huggingface.co/datasets/LLM4OR/StructuredOR and GitHub https://github.com/LLM4OR/StructuredOR.

Abstract: Diversity in demonstration selection is critical for enhancing model generalization by enabling broader coverage of structures and concepts. Constructing appropriate demonstration sets remains a key research challenge. This paper introduces the Relevance-Diversity Enhanced Selection (RDES), an innovative approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks to optimize the selection of diverse reference demonstrations for tasks amenable to in-context learning (ICL), particularly text classification and reasoning, in few-shot prompting scenarios. RDES employs frameworks like Q-learning and a PPO-based variant to dynamically identify demonstrations that maximize both diversity (quantified by label distribution) and relevance to the task objective. This strategy ensures a balanced representation of reference data, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including diverse reasoning tasks, and involving 14 closed-source and open-source LLMs, we demonstrate that RDES significantly enhances performance compared to ten established baselines. Our evaluation includes analysis of performance across varying numbers of demonstrations on selected datasets. Furthermore, we investigate incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which further boosts predictive performance. The results highlight the potential of RL for adaptive demonstration selection and addressing challenges in ICL.

<title>ProcessBench: Identifying Process Errors in Mathematical Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2412.06559v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As language models regularly make mistakes when solving math problems, automated identification of errors in the reasoning process becomes increasingly significant for their scalable oversight. In this paper, we introduce ProcessBench for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench, involving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language models) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has demonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model GPT-4o, despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini. We hope ProcessBench can foster future research in reasoning process assessment, paving the way toward scalable oversight of language models.

Abstract: Adapting visual programming or prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate executable code for visual tasks like visual question answering (VQA) for specialized tasks or domains remains challenging due to high annotation and inference costs. We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with at most 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments. Experimental results show that, with a relatively small amount of question/answer data, small language models can generate high-quality specialized visual programs with the added benefit of much faster inference

arXiv:2412.16216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture of large language models (LLMs) confronts an inherent issue of load imbalance arising from the simplistic linear router strategy, which ultimately causes the instability and inefficient learning of LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel MoE graph-based framework $\textbf{GMoE}$, aimed at enhancing the collaboration among multiple experts. In GMoE, a graph router function is designed to capture the collaboration signals among experts. This enables all experts to dynamically allocate information derived from input data by sharing information with their neighboring experts. Moreover, we put forward two coordination strategies in GMoE: the $\textit{Poisson distribution-based distinction strategy}$ and the $\textit{Normal distribution-based balance strategy}$, to further release the capacity of each expert and increase the model stability in the fine-tuning of LLMs. Specifically, we leverage a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, i.e., Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to implement the graph MoE architecture. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMoE, showing the benefits of facilitating collaborations of multiple experts in LLM fine-tuning. The code of experimental implementation is available at https://github.com/BAI-LAB/GMoE

<title>Latent-space adversarial training with post-aware calibration for defending large language models against jailbreak attacks</title>

Abstract: Ensuring safety alignment has become a critical requirement for large language models (LLMs), particularly given their widespread deployment in real-world applications. However, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which exploit system vulnerabilities to bypass safety measures and generate harmful outputs. Although numerous defense mechanisms based on adversarial training have been proposed, a persistent challenge lies in the exacerbation of over-refusal behaviors, which compromise the overall utility of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a Latent-space Adversarial Training with Post-aware Calibration (LATPC) framework. During the adversarial training phase, LATPC compares harmful and harmless instructions in the latent space and extracts safety-critical dimensions to construct refusal features attack, precisely simulating agnostic jailbreak attack types requiring adversarial mitigation. At the inference stage, an embedding-level calibration mechanism is employed to alleviate over-refusal behaviors with minimal computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to various defense methods across five types of jailbreak attacks, LATPC framework achieves a superior balance between safety and utility. Moreover, our analysis underscores the effectiveness of extracting safety-critical dimensions from the latent space for constructing robust refusal feature attacks.

<title>Divide-Then-Aggregate: An Efficient Tool Learning Method via Parallel Tool Invocation</title>

arXiv:2501.12432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, performing complex real-world tasks still requires tool learning. Mainstream methods, such as CoT/ReAct, rely on step-by-step tool invocation to interact with external environments, but they are limited in perceptual scope and lack adequate task-planning capability. To address these limitations, other studies introduce the first Search-based Decision Tree (DFSDT), which still suffers from the high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel parallel tool invocation paradigm, DTA-Llama (Divide-Then-Aggregate Llama). First, we transform traditional tree-based tool search paths into Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, generating a high-quality parallel tool invocation dataset. The DTA-Llama is then trained on the dataset to learn to iteratively divide the current task into several parallel tool invocation sub-tasks and aggregate the invocation results to decide the next actions. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient inference framework inspired by the Process/Threads mechanism when applying the DTA-Llama to practical tasks. Experimental results show that our approach substantially enhances task performance while reducing token consumption and inference time. Llama2-7B, using our method, is comparable to the official parallel function calling method of GPT-3.5. The relevant code, dataset, and model weights are available at https://corn0205.github.io/

<title>Understanding Multimodal LLMs Under Distribution Shifts: An Information-Theoretic Approach</title>

arXiv:2502.00577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities but struggle under distribution shifts, where evaluation data differ from instruction tuning distributions. Although previous works have provided empirical evaluations, we argue that establishing a formal framework that can characterize and quantify the risk of MLLMs is necessary to ensure the safe and reliable application of MLLMs in the real world. By taking an information-theoretic perspective, we propose the first theoretical framework that enables the quantification of the maximum risk of MLLMs under distribution shifts. Central to our framework is the introduction of Effective Mutual Information (EMI), a principled metric that quantifies the relevance between input queries and model responses. We derive an upper bound for the EMI difference between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, connecting it to visual and textual distributional discrepancies. Extensive experiments on real benchmark datasets, spanning 61 shift scenarios, empirically validate our theoretical insights.

Abstract: Which functions can be used as activations in deep neural networks? This article explores families of functions based on orthonormal bases, including the Hermite polynomial basis and the Fourier trigonometric basis, as well as a basis resulting from the tropicalization of a polynomial basis. Our study shows that, through simple variance-preserving initialization and without additional clamping mechanisms, these activations can successfully be used to train deep models, such as GPT-2 for next-token prediction on OpenWebText and ConvNeXt for image classification on ImageNet. Our work addresses the issue of exploding and vanishing activations and gradients, particularly prevalent with polynomial activations, and opens the door for improving the efficiency of large-scale learning tasks. Furthermore, our approach provides insight into the structure of neural networks, revealing that networks with polynomial activations can be interpreted as multivariate polynomial mappings. Finally, using Hermite interpolation, we show that our activations can closely approximate classical ones in pre-trained models by matching both the function and its derivative, making them especially useful for fine-tuning tasks. These activations are available in the torchortho library, which can be accessed via: https://github.com/K-H-Ismail/torchortho.

arXiv:2502.01534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges and LLM-based data synthesis have emerged as two fundamental LLM-driven data annotation methods in model development. While their combination significantly enhances the efficiency of model training and evaluation, little attention has been given to the potential contamination brought by this new model development paradigm. In this work, we expose preference leakage, a contamination problem in LLM-as-a-judge caused by the relatedness between the synthetic data generators and LLM-based evaluators. To study this issue, we first define three common relatednesses between the data generator LLM and the judge LLM: being the same model, having an inheritance relationship, and belonging to the same model family. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm the bias of judges towards their related student models caused by preference leakage across multiple LLM baselines and benchmarks. Further analysis suggests that preference leakage is a pervasive and real-world problem that is harder to detect compared to previously identified biases in LLM-as-a-judge scenarios. All of these findings imply that preference leakage is a widespread and challenging problem in the area of LLM-as-a-judge. We release all codes and data at: https://github.com/David-Li0406/Preference-Leakage.

Abstract: Most progress in recent coder models has been driven by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), while the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of reliable reward data/model in the code domain. In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis to enhance code model training. Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data. Using these test cases, we construct preference pairs based on pass rates over sampled programs to train reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. It shows an average of 10-point improvement for Llama-3.1-8B-Ins and 5-point improvement for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Ins through best-of-32 sampling, making the 7B model on par with 236B DeepSeek-V2.5. Furthermore, we conduct reinforcement learning with both reward models and test-case pass rewards, leading to consistent improvements across HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench (V4). Notably, we follow the R1-style training to start from Qwen2.5-Coder-base directly and show that our RL training can improve model on HumanEval-plus by over 25\% and MBPP-plus by 6\% for merely 80 optimization steps. We believe our results highlight the huge potential of reinforcement learning in coder models.

arXiv:2502.03930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.

arXiv:2502.07266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to deconstruct complex problems. While longer CoTs are often presumed superior, this paper challenges that notion, arguing that longer is not always better. Drawing on combined evidence from real-world observations, controlled experiments, and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that task accuracy typically follows an inverted U-shaped curve with CoT length, where performance initially improves but eventually decreases as the number of CoT steps increases. With controlled experiments, we further uncover the scaling behaviors of the optimal CoT length: it increases with task difficulty but decreases with model capability, exposing an inherent simplicity bias where more capable models favor shorter, more efficient CoT reasoning. This bias is also evident in Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, where models gravitate towards shorter CoTs as their accuracy improves. To have a deep understanding of these dynamics, we establish a simple theoretical model that formally proves these phenomena, including the optimal length's scaling laws and the emergence of simplicity bias during RL. Guided by this framework, we demonstrate significant practical benefits from training with optimally-lengthed CoTs and employing length-aware filtering at inference. These findings offer both a principled understanding of the "overthinking" phenomenon and multiple practical guidelines for CoT calibration, enabling LLMs to achieve optimal reasoning performance with adaptive CoTs tailored to task complexity and model capability.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of natural language processing. Unfortunately, LLMs face significant security and ethical risks. Although techniques such as safety alignment are developed for defense, prior researches reveal the possibility of bypassing such defenses through well-designed jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose QueryAttack, a novel framework to examine the generalizability of safety alignment. By treating LLMs as knowledge databases, we translate malicious queries in natural language into structured non-natural query language to bypass the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream LLMs, and the results show that QueryAttack not only can achieve high attack success rates (ASRs), but also can jailbreak various defense methods. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against QueryAttack, which can reduce ASR by up to $64\%$ on GPT-4-1106. Our code is available at https://github.com/horizonsinzqs/QueryAttack.

Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents demonstrate strong reasoning and tool use capabilities, but often lack self-awareness, failing to balance these approaches effectively. This imbalance leads to Tool Overuse, where models unnecessarily rely on external tools for tasks solvable with parametric knowledge, increasing computational overhead. Inspired by human metacognition, we introduce SMART (Strategic Model-Aware Reasoning with Tools), a paradigm that enhances an agent's self-awareness to optimize task handling and reduce tool overuse. To support this paradigm, we introduce SMART-ER, a dataset spanning three domains, where reasoning alternates between parametric knowledge and tool-dependent steps, with each step enriched by rationales explaining when tools are necessary. Through supervised training, we develop SMARTAgent, a family of models that dynamically balance parametric knowledge and tool use. Evaluations show that SMARTAgent reduces tool use by 24% while improving performance by over 37%, enabling 7B-scale models to match its 70B counterpart and GPT-4o. Additionally, SMARTAgent generalizes to out-of-distribution test data like GSM8K and MINTQA, maintaining accuracy with just one-fifth the tool calls. These highlight the potential of strategic tool use to enhance reasoning, mitigate overuse, and bridge the gap between model size and performance, advancing intelligent and resource-efficient agent designs.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, yet they often struggle with visual arithmetic, seemingly simple capabilities like object counting or length comparison, which are essential for relevant complex tasks like chart understanding and geometric reasoning. In this work, we first investigate the root causes of this deficiency through a suite of probing tasks focusing on basic visual arithmetic. Our analysis reveals that while pre-trained vision encoders typically capture sufficient information, the text decoder often fails to decode it correctly for arithmetic reasoning. To address this, we propose CogAlign, a novel post-training strategy inspired by Piaget's theory of cognitive development. CogAlign trains VLMs to recognize invariant properties under visual transformations. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of three diverse VLMs on our proposed probing tasks. Furthermore, CogAlign enhances performance by an average of 4.6% on CHOCOLATE and 2.9% on MATH-VISION, outperforming or matching supervised fine-tuning methods while requiring only 60% less training data. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of CogAlign in improving fundamental visual arithmetic capabilities and their transfer to downstream tasks.

Abstract: While long-context inference is crucial for advancing large language model (LLM) applications, its prefill speed remains a significant bottleneck. Current approaches, including sequence parallelism strategies and compute reduction through approximate attention mechanisms, still fall short of delivering optimal inference efficiency. This hinders scaling the inputs to longer sequences and processing long-context queries in a timely manner. To address this, we introduce APB, an efficient long-context inference framework that leverages multi-host approximate attention to enhance prefill speed by reducing compute and enhancing parallelism simultaneously. APB introduces a communication mechanism for essential key-value pairs within a sequence parallelism framework, enabling a faster inference speed while maintaining task performance. We implement APB by incorporating a tailored FlashAttn kernel alongside optimized distribution strategies, supporting diverse models and parallelism configurations. APB achieves speedups of up to 9.2x, 4.2x, and 1.6x compared with FlashAttn, RingAttn, and StarAttn, respectively, without any observable task performance degradation. We provide the implementation and experiment code of APB in https://github.com/thunlp/APB.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle with imperfect retrieval, as traditional retrievers focus on lexical or semantic similarity rather than logical relevance. To address this, we propose \textbf{HopRAG}, a novel RAG framework that augments retrieval with logical reasoning through graph-structured knowledge exploration. During indexing, HopRAG constructs a passage graph, with text chunks as vertices and logical connections established via LLM-generated pseudo-queries as edges. During retrieval, it employs a \textit{retrieve-reason-prune} mechanism: starting with lexically or semantically similar passages, the system explores multi-hop neighbors guided by pseudo-queries and LLM reasoning to identify truly relevant ones. Experiments on multiple multi-hop benchmarks demonstrate that HopRAG's \textit{retrieve-reason-prune} mechanism can expand the retrieval scope based on logical connections and improve final answer quality.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been highly successful in aligning large language models with human preferences. While prevalent methods like DPO have demonstrated strong performance, they frame interactions with the language model as a bandit problem, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where multi-turn conversations are common. Additionally, DPO relies on the Bradley-Terry model assumption, which does not adequately capture the non-transitive nature of human preferences. In this paper, we address these challenges by modeling the alignment problem as a two-player constant-sum Markov game, where each player seeks to maximize their winning rate against the other across all steps of the conversation. Our approach Optimistic Multi-step Preference Optimization (OMPO) is built upon the optimistic online mirror descent algorithm~\citep{rakhlin2013online,joulani17a}. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous analysis for the convergence of OMPO and show that OMPO requires $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ policy updates to converge to an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium. We also validate the effectiveness of our method on multi-turn conversations dataset and math reasoning dataset.

Abstract: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) encode rich, structured information critical for drug discovery tasks, but extracting meaningful insights from large-scale KGs remains challenging due to their complex structure. Existing biomedical subgraph retrieval methods are tailored for graph neural networks (GNNs), limiting compatibility with other paradigms, including large language models (LLMs). We introduce K-Paths, a model-agnostic retrieval framework that extracts structured, diverse, and biologically meaningful multi-hop paths from dense biomedical KGs. These paths enable the prediction of unobserved drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, including those involving entities not seen during training, thus supporting inductive reasoning. K-Paths is training-free and employs a diversity-aware adaptation of Yen's algorithm to extract the K shortest loopless paths between entities in a query, prioritizing biologically relevant and relationally diverse connections. These paths serve as concise, interpretable reasoning chains that can be directly integrated with LLMs or GNNs to improve generalization, accuracy, and enable explainable inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that K-Paths improves zero-shot reasoning across state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, Tx-Gemma 27B improves by 19.8 and 4.0 F1 points on interaction severity prediction and drug repurposing tasks, respectively. Llama 70B achieves gains of 8.5 and 6.2 points on the same tasks. K-Paths also boosts the training efficiency of EmerGNN, a state-of-the-art GNN, by reducing the KG size by 90% while maintaining predictive performance. Beyond efficiency, K-Paths bridges the gap between KGs and LLMs, enabling scalable and explainable LLM-augmented scientific discovery. We release our code and the retrieved paths as a benchmark for inductive reasoning.

Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) mapped to problems help model student learning, tracking their mastery levels on fine-grained skills thereby facilitating personalized learning and feedback in online learning platforms. However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor-intensive. We present a fully automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a real-world student code submission dataset. We find that KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and human-written KCs on future student response prediction. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs result in a better fit than human-written KCs under a cognitive model. We also conduct a human evaluation with course instructors to show that our pipeline generates reasonably accurate problem-KC mappings.

Abstract: Understanding domain-specific theorems often requires more than just text-based reasoning; effective communication through structured visual explanations is crucial for deeper comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in text-based theorem reasoning, their ability to generate coherent and pedagogically meaningful visual explanations remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce TheoremExplainAgent, an agentic approach for generating long-form theorem explanation videos (over 5 minutes) using Manim animations. To systematically evaluate multimodal theorem explanations, we propose TheoremExplainBench, a benchmark covering 240 theorems across multiple STEM disciplines, along with 5 automated evaluation metrics. Our results reveal that agentic planning is essential for generating detailed long-form videos, and the o3-mini agent achieves a success rate of 93.8% and an overall score of 0.77. However, our quantitative and qualitative studies show that most of the videos produced exhibit minor issues with visual element layout. Furthermore, multimodal explanations expose deeper reasoning flaws that text-based explanations fail to reveal, highlighting the importance of multimodal explanations.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have become increasingly prominent in the deployment on edge devices due to their high efficiency and low computational cost. While researchers continue to advance the capabilities of SLMs through innovative training strategies and model compression techniques, the security risks of SLMs have received considerably less attention compared to large language models (LLMs).To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the security performance of 13 state-of-the-art SLMs under various jailbreak attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that most SLMs are quite susceptible to existing jailbreak attacks, while some of them are even vulnerable to direct harmful prompts.To address the safety concerns, we evaluate several representative defense methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in enhancing the security of SLMs. We further analyze the potential security degradation caused by different SLM techniques including architecture compression, quantization, knowledge distillation, and so on. We expect that our research can highlight the security challenges of SLMs and provide valuable insights to future work in developing more robust and secure SLMs.

These models leverage the synergy between visual and textual information, enabling them to understand and reason about the content present in images and text in a unified manner. This article provides a brief overview of CLIP based on few-shot prompt learning, including experimental data and technical characteristics of some methods. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference for researchers who have just started their research in generalizable prompting of CLIP through few-shot training for classification across 15 datasets and also to facilitate the integration of this field by researchers in other downstream tasks.

<title>Language Models, Graph Searching, and Supervision Adulteration: When More Supervision is Less and How to Make More More</title>

Abstract: This work concerns the path-star task, a minimal example of searching over a graph. The graph, $G$, is star-shaped with $D$ arms radiating from a start node, $s$. A language model (LM) is given $G$, $s$, and a target node $t$, which ends one of the arms and is tasked with generating the arm containing $t$. The minimal nature of this task means only a single choice needs to be made: which of the $D$ arms contains $t$?
  Decoder-only LMs fail to solve this elementary task above $1/D$ chance due to a learned shortcut that absorbs training supervision. We show how this pathology is caused by excess supervision and we present a series of solutions demonstrating that the task is solvable via decoder-only LMs. We find that the task's minimal nature causes its difficulty, as it prevents task decomposition. Our solutions provide insight into the pathology and its implications for LMs trained via next-token prediction.

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), the task of locating specific video segments based on language queries, is a core challenge in long-form video understanding. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown early promise in tackling TVG through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), their abilities to generalize remain limited. To address this, we propose a novel post-training framework that enhances the generalization capabilities of LVLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our contributions span three key directions: (1) Time-R1: we introduce a reasoning-guided post-training framework via RL with verifiable reward to enhance the capabilities of LVLMs on the TVG task. (2) TimeRFT: we explore data-efficient post-training strategies on our curated RL-friendly dataset, which trains the model to progressively comprehend difficult samples, leading to better generalization. (3) TVGBench: we carefully construct a small yet comprehensive benchmark for LVLM evaluation, assessing 11 types of queries and featuring balanced distributions across both videos and queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream datasets using only 2.5K training data, while improving its general video understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) activates only a subset of experts during inference, allowing the model to maintain low inference FLOPs and latency even as the parameter count scales up. However, since MoE dynamically selects the experts, all the experts need to be loaded into VRAM. Their large parameter size still limits deployment, and offloading, which load experts into VRAM only when needed, significantly increase inference latency. To address this, we propose Mixture of Lookup Experts (MoLE), a new MoE architecture that is efficient in both communication and VRAM usage. In MoLE, the experts are Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) during training, taking the output of the embedding layer as input. Before inference, these experts can be re-parameterized as lookup tables (LUTs) that retrieves expert outputs based on input ids, and offloaded to storage devices. Therefore, we do not need to perform expert computations during inference. Instead, we directly retrieve the expert's computation results based on input ids and load them into VRAM, and thus the resulting communication overhead is negligible. Experiments show that, with the same FLOPs and VRAM usage, MoLE achieves inference speeds comparable to dense models and significantly faster than MoE with experts offloading, while maintaining performance on par with MoE.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a key architectural paradigm for efficiently scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) by selectively activating a subset of parameters for each input token. However, standard MoE architectures face significant challenges, including high memory consumption and communication overhead during distributed training. In this paper, we introduce Mixture of Latent Experts (MoLAE), a novel parameterization that addresses these limitations by reformulating expert operations through a shared projection into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by expert-specific transformations. This factorized approach substantially reduces parameter count and computational requirements, particularly in existing LLMs where hidden dimensions significantly exceed MoE intermediate dimensions. We provide a rigorous mathematical framework for transforming pre-trained MoE models into MoLAE architecture, characterizing conditions for optimal factorization, and developing a systematic two-step algorithm for this conversion. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrates that MoLAE significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while preserving model capabilities. Experimental results confirm that MoLAE achieves comparable performance to standard MoE with substantially reduced resource requirements.

Abstract: As digitalization and cloud technologies evolve, the web is becoming increasingly important in the modern society. Autonomous web agents based on large language models (LLMs) hold a great potential in work automation. It is therefore important to accurately measure and monitor the progression of their capabilities. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the current state of web agents. Our results depict a very different picture of the competency of current agents, suggesting over-optimism in previously reported results. This gap can be attributed to shortcomings in existing benchmarks. We introduce Online-Mind2Web, an online evaluation benchmark consisting of 300 diverse and realistic tasks spanning 136 websites. It enables us to evaluate web agents under a setting that approximates how real users use these agents. To facilitate more scalable evaluation and development, we also develop a novel LLM-as-a-Judge automatic evaluation method and show that it can achieve around 85% agreement with human judgment, substantially higher than existing methods. Finally, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of current web agents, highlighting both their strengths and limitations to inspire future research.

Abstract: With the increasingly deep integration of large language models (LLMs) across diverse domains, the effectiveness of their safety mechanisms is encountering severe challenges. Currently, jailbreak attacks based on prompt engineering have become a major safety threat. However, existing methods primarily rely on black-box manipulation of prompt templates, resulting in poor interpretability and limited generalization. To break through the bottleneck, this study first introduces the concept of Defense Threshold Decay (DTD), revealing the potential safety impact caused by LLMs' benign generation: as benign content generation in LLMs increases, the model's focus on input instructions progressively diminishes. Building on this insight, we propose the Sugar-Coated Poison (SCP) attack paradigm, which uses a "semantic reversal" strategy to craft benign inputs that are opposite in meaning to malicious intent. This strategy induces the models to generate extensive benign content, thereby enabling adversarial reasoning to bypass safety mechanisms. Experiments show that SCP outperforms existing baselines. Remarkably, it achieves an average attack success rate of 87.23% across six LLMs. For defense, we propose Part-of-Speech Defense (POSD), leveraging verb-noun dependencies for syntactic analysis to enhance safety of LLMs while preserving their generalization ability.

Abstract: The integration of tool learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities in handling complex tasks by leveraging external tools. However, existing benchmarks for tool learning inadequately address critical real-world personalized scenarios, particularly those requiring multi-hop reasoning and inductive knowledge adaptation in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce FamilyTool, a novel benchmark grounded in a family-based knowledge graph (KG) that simulates personalized, multi-hop tool use scenarios. FamilyTool, including base and extended datasets, challenges LLMs with queries spanning from 1 to 4 relational hops (e.g., inferring familial connections and preferences) and 2 to 6 hops respectively, and incorporates an inductive KG setting where models must adapt to unseen user preferences and relationships without re-training, a common limitation in prior approaches that compromises generalization. We further propose KGETool: a simple KG-augmented evaluation pipeline to systematically assess LLMs' tool use ability in these settings. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, with accuracy dropping sharply as hop complexity increases and inductive scenarios exposing severe generalization deficits. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling personalized, evolving real-world contexts and highlight the urgent need for advancements in tool-learning frameworks. FamilyTool serves as a critical resource for evaluating and advancing LLM agents' reasoning, adaptability, and scalability in complex, dynamic environments. Code and dataset are available at \href{https://github.com/yxzwang/FamilyTool}{https://github.com/yxzwang/FamilyTool}.

Abstract: High-quality code documentation is crucial for software development especially in the era of AI. However, generating it automatically using Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging, as existing approaches often produce incomplete, unhelpful, or factually incorrect outputs. We introduce DocAgent, a novel multi-agent collaborative system using topological code processing for incremental context building. Specialized agents (Reader, Searcher, Writer, Verifier, Orchestrator) then collaboratively generate documentation. We also propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework assessing Completeness, Helpfulness, and Truthfulness. Comprehensive experiments show DocAgent significantly outperforms baselines consistently. Our ablation study confirms the vital role of the topological processing order. DocAgent offers a robust approach for reliable code documentation generation in complex and proprietary repositories.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities and are receiving increasing attention to enhance their reasoning through scaling test--time compute. However, their application in open--ended, knowledge--intensive, complex reasoning scenarios is still limited. Reasoning--oriented methods struggle to generalize to open--ended scenarios due to implicit assumptions of complete world knowledge. Meanwhile, knowledge--augmented reasoning (KAR) methods fail to address two core challenges: 1) error propagation, where errors in early steps cascade through the chain, and 2) verification bottleneck, where the explore--exploit tradeoff arises in multi--branch decision processes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARise, a novel framework that integrates risk assessment of intermediate reasoning states with dynamic retrieval--augmented generation (RAG) within a Monte Carlo tree search paradigm. This approach enables effective construction and optimization of reasoning plans across multiple maintained hypothesis branches. Experimental results show that ARise significantly outperforms the state--of--the--art KAR methods by up to 23.10%, and the latest RAG-equipped large reasoning models by up to 25.37%.

Abstract: Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-AI interaction and achieved significant success in the generation of novel ideas. However, current assessments of idea generation overlook crucial factors such as knowledge leakage in LLMs, the absence of open-ended benchmarks with grounded truth, and the limited scope of feasibility analysis constrained by prompt design. These limitations hinder the potential of uncovering groundbreaking research ideas. In this paper, we present AI Idea Bench 2025, a framework designed to quantitatively evaluate and compare the ideas generated by LLMs within the domain of AI research from diverse perspectives. The framework comprises a comprehensive dataset of 3,495 AI papers and their associated inspired works, along with a robust evaluation methodology. This evaluation system gauges idea quality in two dimensions: alignment with the ground-truth content of the original papers and judgment based on general reference material. AI Idea Bench 2025's benchmarking system stands to be an invaluable resource for assessing and comparing idea-generation techniques, thereby facilitating the automation of scientific discovery.

arXiv:2504.15266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed as seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling. We make part of the code available under https://github.com/chenwu98/algorithmic-creativity

Abstract: The rapid advancement in capabilities of large language models (LLMs) raises a pivotal question: How can LLMs accelerate scientific discovery? This work tackles the crucial first stage of research, generating novel hypotheses. While recent work on automated hypothesis generation focuses on multi-agent frameworks and extending test-time compute, none of the approaches effectively incorporate transparency and steerability through a synergistic Human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS: Interactive Research Ideation System, an open-source platform designed for researchers to leverage LLM-assisted scientific ideation. IRIS incorporates innovative features to enhance ideation, including adaptive test-time compute expansion via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), fine-grained feedback mechanism, and query-based literature synthesis. Designed to empower researchers with greater control and insight throughout the ideation process. We additionally conduct a user study with researchers across diverse disciplines, validating the effectiveness of our system in enhancing ideation. We open-source our code at https://github.com/Anikethh/IRIS-Interactive-Research-Ideation-System

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents presents unique challenges including long-horizon decision making and interacting with stochastic environment feedback. While reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled progress in static tasks, multi-turn agent RL training remains underexplored. We propose StarPO (State-Thinking-Actions-Reward Policy Optimization), a general framework for trajectory-level agent RL, and introduce RAGEN, a modular system for training and evaluating LLM agents. Our study on four stylized environments reveals three core findings. First, our agent RL training shows a recurring mode of Echo Trap where reward variance cliffs and gradient spikes; we address this with StarPO-S, a stabilized variant with trajectory filtering, critic incorporation, and gradient stabilization. Second, we find the shaping of RL rollouts would benefit from diverse initial states, medium interaction granularity and more frequent sampling. Third, we show that without fine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals, agent reasoning hardly emerge through multi-turn RL and they may show shallow strategies or hallucinated thoughts. Code and environments are available at https://github.com/RAGEN-AI/RAGEN.

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Furthermore, RLVR with only two examples even slightly exceeds these results (MATH500: 74.8%, average: 36.6%). Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples (when employed as a single training example). In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by incorporating entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. We also further discuss related observations about format correction, label robustness and prompt modification. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR efficiency and encourage a re-examination of recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR. Our code, model, and data are open source at https://github.com/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR.

Abstract: Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&amp;When dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive error steps. Using the Who&amp;When, we develop and evaluate three automated failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and the need for further research in this area.

<title>SepALM: Audio Language Models Are Error Correctors for Robust Speech Separation</title>

Abstract: While contemporary speech separation technologies adeptly process lengthy mixed audio waveforms, they are frequently challenged by the intricacies of real-world environments, including noisy and reverberant settings, which can result in artifacts or distortions in the separated speech. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SepALM, a pioneering approach that employs audio language models (ALMs) to rectify and re-synthesize speech within the text domain following preliminary separation. SepALM comprises four core components: a separator, a corrector, a synthesizer, and an aligner. By integrating an ALM-based end-to-end error correction mechanism, we mitigate the risk of error accumulation and circumvent the optimization hurdles typically encountered in conventional methods that amalgamate automatic speech recognition (ASR) with large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we have developed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and knowledge distillation techniques to facilitate the reasoning and training processes of the ALM. Our experiments substantiate that SepALM not only elevates the precision of speech separation but also markedly bolsters adaptability in novel acoustic environments.

<title>Benign Samples Matter! Fine-tuning On Outlier Benign Samples Severely Breaks Safety</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06843</link>

arXiv:2505.06843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a troubling vulnerability in the fine-tuning stage of large language models (LLMs): even fine-tuning on entirely benign datasets can lead to a significant increase in the harmfulness of LLM outputs. Building on this finding, our red teaming study takes this threat one step further by developing a more effective attack. Specifically, we analyze and identify samples within benign datasets that contribute most to safety degradation, then fine-tune LLMs exclusively on these samples. We approach this problem from an outlier detection perspective and propose Self-Inf-N, to detect and extract outliers for fine-tuning. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning LLMs on 100 outlier samples selected by Self-Inf-N in the benign datasets severely compromises LLM safety alignment. Extensive experiments across seven mainstream LLMs demonstrate that our attack exhibits high transferability across different architectures and remains effective in practical scenarios. Alarmingly, our results indicate that most existing mitigation strategies fail to defend against this attack, underscoring the urgent need for more robust alignment safeguards. Codes are available at https://github.com/GuanZihan/Benign-Samples-Matter.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital records of patient information, often containing unstructured clinical text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is essential in EHRs for extracting key medical entities like problems, tests, and treatments to support downstream clinical applications. This paper explores prompt-based medical entity recognition using large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, guided by various prompt engineering techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot, and an ensemble approach. Among all strategies, GPT-4o with prompt ensemble achieved the highest classification performance with an F1-score of 0.95 and recall of 0.98, outperforming DeepSeek-R1 on the task. The ensemble method improved reliability by aggregating outputs through embedding-based similarity and majority voting.

<title>Efficient Uncertainty Estimation via Distillation of Bayesian Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.11731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in uncertainty estimation for Large Language Models (LLMs) during downstream adaptation have addressed key challenges of reliability and simplicity. However, existing Bayesian methods typically require multiple sampling iterations during inference, creating significant efficiency issues that limit practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of eliminating the need for test-time sampling for LLM uncertainty estimation. Specifically, when given an off-the-shelf Bayesian LLM, we distill its aligned confidence into a non-Bayesian student LLM by minimizing the divergence between their predictive distributions. Unlike typical calibration methods, our distillation is carried out solely on the training dataset without the need of an additional validation dataset. This simple yet effective approach achieves N-times more efficient uncertainty estimation during testing, where N is the number of samples traditionally required by Bayesian LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation capabilities on training data can successfully generalize to unseen test data through our distillation technique, consistently producing results comparable to (or even better than) state-of-the-art Bayesian LLMs.

arXiv:2505.12992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning.

<title>Warm Up Before You Train: Unlocking General Reasoning in Resource-Constrained Settings</title>

arXiv:2505.13718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing effective reasoning-capable LLMs typically requires training using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) or distillation with carefully curated Long Chain of Thoughts (CoT), both of which depend heavily on extensive training data. This creates a major challenge when the amount of quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the first stage, we "warm up" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain, namely, Knights \& Knaves (K\&amp;K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this two-phase approach offers several benefits: $(i)$ the warmup phase alone facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval$^{+}$, and MMLU-Pro; $(ii)$ When both the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small dataset ($\leq100$ examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the base model; $(iii)$ Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; $(iv)$ Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall sample efficiency during RLVR training. The results in this paper highlight the promise of warmup for building robust reasoning LLMs in data-scarce environments.

<title>PandaGuard: Systematic Evaluation of LLM Safety against Jailbreaking Attacks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.13862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts known as jailbreaks, which can bypass safety alignment and elicit harmful outputs. Despite growing efforts in LLM safety research, existing evaluations are often fragmented, focused on isolated attack or defense techniques, and lack systematic, reproducible analysis. In this work, we introduce PandaGuard, a unified and modular framework that models LLM jailbreak safety as a multi-agent system comprising attackers, defenders, and judges. Our framework implements 19 attack methods and 12 defense mechanisms, along with multiple judgment strategies, all within a flexible plugin architecture supporting diverse LLM interfaces, multiple interaction modes, and configuration-driven experimentation that enhances reproducibility and practical deployment. Built on this framework, we develop PandaBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the interactions between these attack/defense methods across 49 LLMs and various judgment approaches, requiring over 3 billion tokens to execute. Our extensive evaluation reveals key insights into model vulnerabilities, defense cost-performance trade-offs, and judge consistency. We find that no single defense is optimal across all dimensions and that judge disagreement introduces nontrivial variance in safety assessments. We release the code, configurations, and evaluation results to support transparent and reproducible research in LLM safety.

Abstract: Spoken Keyword Spotting (KWS) is the task of distinguishing between the presence and absence of a keyword in audio. The accuracy of a KWS model hinges on its ability to correctly classify examples close to the keyword and non-keyword boundary. These boundary examples are often scarce in training data, limiting model performance. In this paper, we propose a method to systematically generate adversarial examples close to the decision boundary by making insertion/deletion/substitution edits on the keyword's graphemes. We evaluate this technique on held-out data for a popular keyword and show that the technique improves AUC on a dataset of synthetic hard negatives by 61% while maintaining quality on positives and ambient negative audio data.

Summary: 
Chain-of-Model (CoM) introduces a novel learning paradigm incorporating causal relationships in hidden states, offering scaling efficiency and deployment flexibility. The concept of Chain-of-Representation (CoR) formulates hidden states as chains at the hidden dimension level. Models built on CoM can progressively scale up model size by increasing chains and provide varying sizes for elastic inference. Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM) integrates CoM into Transformer architecture. CoLM-Air enhances CoLM with a KV sharing mechanism for key and value computation efficiency. Experimental results show comparable performance to the standard Transformer. CoLM family enables progressive scaling for training efficiency and multiple model sizes for flexible inference, advancing language model development. Our code will be available at https://github.com/microsoft/CoLM. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm, termed Chain-of-Model (CoM), which incorporates the causal relationship into the hidden states of each layer as a chain style, thereby introducing great scaling efficiency in model training and inference flexibility in deployment. We introduce the concept of Chain-of-Representation (CoR), which formulates the hidden states at each layer as a combination of multiple sub-representations (i.e., chains) at the hidden dimension level. In each layer, each chain from the output representations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input representations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can progressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the previous models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes for elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this principle, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the idea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture. Based on CoLM, we further introduce CoLM-Air by introducing a KV sharing mechanism, that computes all keys and values within the first chain and then shares across all chains. This design demonstrates additional extensibility, such as enabling seamless LM switching, prefilling acceleration and so on. Experimental results demonstrate our CoLM family can achieve comparable performance to the standard Transformer, while simultaneously enabling greater flexiblity, such as progressive scaling to improve training efficiency and offer multiple varying model sizes for elastic inference, paving a a new way toward building language models. Our code will be released in the future at: https://github.com/microsoft/CoLM.

Abstract: Identifying hate speech content in the Arabic language is challenging due to the rich quality of dialectal variations. This study introduces a multilabel hate speech dataset in the Arabic language. We have collected 10000 Arabic tweets and annotated each tweet, whether it contains offensive content or not. If a text contains offensive content, we further classify it into different hate speech targets such as religion, gender, politics, ethnicity, origin, and others. A text can contain either single or multiple targets. Multiple annotators are involved in the data annotation task. We calculated the inter-annotator agreement, which was reported to be 0.86 for offensive content and 0.71 for multiple hate speech targets. Finally, we evaluated the data annotation task by employing a different transformers-based model in which AraBERTv2 outperformed with a micro-F1 score of 0.7865 and an accuracy of 0.786.

Summary: 
Our study examines the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on the use of language technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), among individuals from diverse backgrounds. We collected data from 1,000 participants and found distinct patterns in language technology usage based on SES, including differences in interaction styles and topics. Higher SES individuals tend to use language technologies for tasks requiring abstraction and discuss topics like inclusivity and travel, while lower SES individuals exhibit more anthropomorphism towards LLMs and use concrete language. These findings highlight the digital divide perpetuated by socioeconomic linguistic differences and emphasize the importance of considering SES in the development of language technologies to bridge the AI Gap and cater to diverse linguistic needs. <div>
arXiv:2505.12158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Socioeconomic status (SES) fundamentally influences how people interact with each other and more recently, with digital technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous research has highlighted the interaction between SES and language technology, it was limited by reliance on proxy metrics and synthetic data. We survey 1,000 individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds about their use of language technologies and generative AI, and collect 6,482 prompts from their previous interactions with LLMs. We find systematic differences across SES groups in language technology usage (i.e., frequency, performed tasks), interaction styles, and topics. Higher SES entails a higher level of abstraction, convey requests more concisely, and topics like 'inclusivity' and 'travel'. Lower SES correlates with higher anthropomorphization of LLMs (using ''hello'' and ''thank you'') and more concrete language. Our findings suggest that while generative language technologies are becoming more accessible to everyone, socioeconomic linguistic differences still stratify their use to exacerbate the digital divide. These differences underscore the importance of considering SES in developing language technologies to accommodate varying linguistic needs rooted in socioeconomic factors and limit the AI Gap across SES groups.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces UniEdit, a benchmark for editing large language models (LLMs) that spans various open-domain knowledge domains. It addresses the limitations of current LLM editing datasets by incorporating entities from 25 different domains and utilizing triple knowledge from open-domain graphs for comprehensive coverage. The Neighborhood Multi-hop Chain Sampling (NMCS) algorithm is designed to sample subgraphs and evaluate ripple effects. The benchmark ensures grammatical accuracy and syntactical diversity by converting knowledge subgraphs into natural language text. Extensive statistical analysis demonstrates the scale, comprehensiveness, and diversity of UniEdit. Experiments across different LLMs and editors highlight performance strengths and weaknesses in editing across open knowledge domains, providing insights for future research. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Model editing aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) by efficiently adjusting their internal parameters. Currently, most LLM editing datasets are confined to narrow knowledge domains and cover a limited range of editing evaluation. They often overlook the broad scope of editing demands and the diversity of ripple effects resulting from edits. In this context, we introduce UniEdit, a unified benchmark for LLM editing grounded in open-domain knowledge. First, we construct editing samples by selecting entities from 25 common domains across five major categories, utilizing the extensive triple knowledge available in open-domain knowledge graphs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domains. To address the issues of generality and locality in editing, we design an Neighborhood Multi-hop Chain Sampling (NMCS) algorithm to sample subgraphs based on a given knowledge piece to entail comprehensive ripple effects to evaluate. Finally, we employ proprietary LLMs to convert the sampled knowledge subgraphs into natural language text, guaranteeing grammatical accuracy and syntactical diversity. Extensive statistical analysis confirms the scale, comprehensiveness, and diversity of our UniEdit benchmark. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple LLMs and editors, analyzing their performance to highlight strengths and weaknesses in editing across open knowledge domains and various evaluation criteria, thereby offering valuable insights for future research endeavors.

<div> Keywords: Graphical user interface, multimodal large language models, backdoor attacks, AgentGhost, defense method

Summary:<br /><br />Graphical user interface agents powered by multimodal large language models have shown promise for human interaction but are susceptible to backdoor attacks. The AgentGhost framework introduces a stealthy method for injecting backdoors into GUI agents by exploiting interaction-level triggers. By combining goal and interaction levels, backdoors can be activated unintentionally while maintaining task utility. This framework utilizes Min-Max optimization and supervised contrastive learning to maximize feature differences across sample classes, enhancing flexibility. Additionally, supervised fine-tuning minimizes the discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, improving effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations on established mobile benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generic nature of AgentGhost, with high attack accuracy and minimal utility degradation. A defense method is proposed to reduce the attack accuracy of AgentGhost significantly. This work highlights the importance of securing GUI agents powered by large language models against backdoor attacks. <div>

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown greater promise for human-interaction. However, due to the high fine-tuning cost, users often rely on open-source GUI agents or APIs offered by AI providers, which introduces a critical but underexplored supply chain threat: backdoor attacks. In this work, we first unveil that MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers, such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic, with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\% on three attack objectives, and shows stealthiness with only 1\% utility degradation. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against AgentGhost that reduces the attack accuracy to 22.1\%. Our code is available at \texttt{anonymous}.

<div> Keywords: prompt engineering, large language models, domain-specific tasks, specificity, synonymization framework 

Summary: 
- Prompt specificity plays a crucial role in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific tasks such as STEM, medicine, and law.
- This thesis investigates the impact of increasing the specificity of vocabulary in prompts on LLM performance in question-answering and reasoning tasks.
- A synonymization framework was developed to systematically substitute nouns, verbs, and adjectives with varying specificity levels across four LLMs and datasets in STEM, law, and medicine.
- Results indicate that there is an optimal specificity range where LLMs perform the best, highlighting the importance of prompt design within this range for maximizing performance.
- Manipulating prompts within the identified specificity range can lead to more efficient applications of LLMs in specialized domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical component in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific tasks. However, the role of prompt specificity, especially in domains like STEM (physics, chemistry, biology, computer science and mathematics), medicine, and law, remains underexplored. This thesis addresses the problem of whether increasing the specificity of vocabulary in prompts improves LLM performance in domain-specific question-answering and reasoning tasks. We developed a synonymization framework to systematically substitute nouns, verbs, and adjectives with varying specificity levels, measuring the impact on four LLMs: Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, Granite-13B-Instruct-V2, Flan-T5-XL, and Mistral-Large 2, across datasets in STEM, law, and medicine. Our results reveal that while generally increasing the specificity of prompts does not have a significant impact, there appears to be a specificity range, across all considered models, where the LLM performs the best. Identifying this optimal specificity range offers a key insight for prompt design, suggesting that manipulating prompts within this range could maximize LLM performance and lead to more efficient applications in specialized domains.

<div> Keywords: web data, government response, disaster, social media, crisis

Summary:
Our study explores the use of social media and public inquiry submissions to understand public behavior during disasters, focusing on the 2022 floods in New South Wales, Australia. By analyzing flood-related tweets and inquiry submissions, we identify behavioral patterns using innovative methodologies such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Large Language Models (LLMs). LDA helps uncover distinct opinions and geographic patterns in the data, while LLMs enhance semantic understanding and filtering capabilities. Our Relevance Index method combines these data streams to reduce noise and prioritize actionable content for emergency responders, improving situational awareness. By leveraging AI-driven approaches, our study offers a novel method to refine crisis-related social media content, enhance real-time disaster response efforts, and inform long-term resilience planning. <div>

Abstract: Massive and diverse web data are increasingly vital for government disaster response, as demonstrated by the 2022 floods in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. This study examines how X (formerly Twitter) and public inquiry submissions provide insights into public behaviour during crises. We analyse more than 55,000 flood-related tweets and 1,450 submissions to identify behavioural patterns during extreme weather events. While social media posts are short and fragmented, inquiry submissions are detailed, multi-page documents offering structured insights. Our methodology integrates Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance semantic understanding. LDA reveals distinct opinions and geographic patterns, while LLMs improve filtering by identifying flood-relevant tweets using public submissions as a reference. This Relevance Index method reduces noise and prioritizes actionable content, improving situational awareness for emergency responders. By combining these complementary data streams, our approach introduces a novel AI-driven method to refine crisis-related social media content, improve real-time disaster response, and inform long-term resilience planning.

Abstract: A data-driven quantitative approach was used to develop a novel classification system for beer categories and styles. Sixty-two thousand one hundred twenty-one beer recipes were mined and analyzed, considering ingredient profiles, fermentation parameters, and recipe vital statistics. Statistical analyses combined with self-organizing maps (SOMs) identified four major superclusters that showed distinctive malt and hop usage patterns, style characteristics, and historical brewing traditions. Cold fermented styles showed a conservative grain and hop composition, whereas hot fermented beers exhibited high heterogeneity, reflecting regional preferences and innovation. This new taxonomy offers a reproducible and objective framework beyond traditional sensory-based classifications, providing brewers, researchers, and educators with a scalable tool for recipe analysis and beer development. The findings in this work provide an understanding of beer diversity and open avenues for linking ingredient usage with fermentation profiles and flavor outcomes.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, Radiology, Knowledge Graphs, Multimodal, Generation

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach for generating radiology-specific knowledge graphs using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) framework. Traditional methods struggle with the specialized language of radiology reports and the lack of domain-specific data. The proposed multimodal VLM-based framework combines radiology reports and radiographic images to enhance knowledge graph generation in radiology. By incorporating both modalities, the model outperforms existing unimodal solutions. This approach is the first of its kind in the field of radiology knowledge graph generation, addressing the limitations of previous methods. The framework is able to handle long-form radiology data efficiently and effectively, providing valuable insights and enhancing various downstream tasks in the radiology domain. <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language generation, excelling at instruction following and structured output generation. Knowledge graphs play a crucial role in radiology, serving as valuable sources of factual information and enhancing various downstream tasks. However, generating radiology-specific knowledge graphs presents significant challenges due to the specialized language of radiology reports and the limited availability of domain-specific data. Existing solutions are predominantly unimodal, meaning they generate knowledge graphs only from radiology reports while excluding radiographic images. Additionally, they struggle with long-form radiology data due to limited context length. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal VLM-based framework for knowledge graph generation in radiology. Our approach outperforms previous methods and introduces the first multimodal solution for radiology knowledge graph generation.

<div> reproducibility assessment, NLP, QRA++, experiments, comparability  
Summary:  
- QRA++ is introduced as a quantitative approach to assess reproducibility in NLP studies.
- The approach provides continuous-valued assessments at three levels of detail.
- It allows for direct comparisons of reproducibility measures across different studies.
- QRA++ is grounded in the degree of similarity between experiments to set expectations.
- Results from applying QRA++ to comparable experiments suggest that reproducibility depends on experiment properties, system type, and evaluation method.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproduction studies reported in NLP provide individual data points which in combination indicate worryingly low levels of reproducibility in the field. Because each reproduction study reports quantitative conclusions based on its own, often not explicitly stated, criteria for reproduction success/failure, the conclusions drawn are hard to interpret, compare, and learn from. In this paper, we present QRA++, a quantitative approach to reproducibility assessment that (i) produces continuous-valued degree of reproducibility assessments at three levels of granularity; (ii) utilises reproducibility measures that are directly comparable across different studies; and (iii) grounds expectations about degree of reproducibility in degree of similarity between experiments. QRA++ enables more informative reproducibility assessments to be conducted, and conclusions to be drawn about what causes reproducibility to be better/poorer. We illustrate this by applying QRA++ to three example sets of comparable experiments, revealing clear evidence that degree of reproducibility depends on similarity of experiment properties, but also system type and evaluation method.

Abstract: Recent studies have separately highlighted significant biases within foundational large language models (LLMs) against certain nationalities and stigmatized social groups. This research investigates the ethical implications of these biases intersecting with outputs of widely-used GPT-3.5/4/4o LLMS. Through structured prompt series, we evaluate model responses to several scenarios involving American and North Korean nationalities with various mental disabilities. Findings reveal significant discrepancies in empathy levels with North Koreans facing greater negative bias, particularly when mental disability is also a factor. This underscores the need for improvements in LLMs designed with a nuanced understanding of intersectional identity.

Summary: Physicians in the US are using AI tools as scribes to document clinical encounters. A study compared large language model (LLM) generated notes with those from experts using the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI9). High agreement among evaluators was found in general medicine, orthopedics, and obstetrics and gynecology, with moderate to high in pediatrics and cardiology. Gold notes scored slightly higher than Ambient notes in overall quality. The study suggests the PDQI9 tool is effective in evaluating LLM authored notes compared to human-authored ones. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical practices across the United States, physicians have begun implementing generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to perform the function of scribes in order to reduce the burden of documenting clinical encounters. Despite their widespread use, no established methods exist to gauge the quality of AI scribes. To address this gap, we developed a blinded study comparing the relative performance of large language model (LLM) generated clinical notes with those from field experts based on audio-recorded clinical encounters. Quantitative metrics from the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI9) provided a framework to measure note quality, which we adapted to assess relative performance of AI generated notes. Clinical experts spanning 5 medical specialties used the PDQI9 tool to evaluate specialist-drafted Gold notes and LLM authored Ambient notes. Two evaluators from each specialty scored notes drafted from a total of 97 patient visits. We found uniformly high inter rater agreement (RWG greater than 0.7) between evaluators in general medicine, orthopedics, and obstetrics and gynecology, and moderate (RWG 0.5 to 0.7) to high inter rater agreement in pediatrics and cardiology. We found a modest yet significant difference in the overall note quality, wherein Gold notes achieved a score of 4.25 out of 5 and Ambient notes scored 4.20 out of 5 (p = 0.04). Our findings support the use of the PDQI9 instrument as a practical method to gauge the quality of LLM authored notes, as compared to human-authored notes.

Three tasks are defined: Stance Detection, Temporal Classification, and Uncertainty Estimation. Benchmarking experiments on seven Pretrained Language Models and nine Large Language Models show that a model trained on aggregated data across banks outperforms individual bank data models. Rigorous evaluations and predictive tasks validate the framework's economic utility. The artifacts are accessible through HuggingFace and GitHub under the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. <div>

Abstract: Central banks around the world play a crucial role in maintaining economic stability. Deciphering policy implications in their communications is essential, especially as misinterpretations can disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. To address this, we introduce the World Central Banks (WCB) dataset, the most comprehensive monetary policy corpus to date, comprising over 380k sentences from 25 central banks across diverse geographic regions, spanning 28 years of historical data. After uniformly sampling 1k sentences per bank (25k total) across all available years, we annotate and review each sentence using dual annotators, disagreement resolutions, and secondary expert reviews. We define three tasks: Stance Detection, Temporal Classification, and Uncertainty Estimation, with each sentence annotated for all three. We benchmark seven Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and nine Large Language Models (LLMs) (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and with annotation guide) on these tasks, running 15,075 benchmarking experiments. We find that a model trained on aggregated data across banks significantly surpasses a model trained on an individual bank's data, confirming the principle "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts." Additionally, rigorous human evaluations, error analyses, and predictive tasks validate our framework's economic utility. Our artifacts are accessible through the HuggingFace and GitHub under the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

Summary: 
- Large Language Models (LLMs) were found to exhibit bias in selecting candidates based on gender cues in resumes.
- Despite identical qualifications, LLMs consistently favored female-named candidates across various professions.
- Adding explicit gender fields to resumes increased the preference for female applicants.
- Gender-neutral identifiers resulted in gender parity in candidate selection.
- LLMs showed a positional bias to select the candidate listed first in the prompt. 
- The study highlights the need for caution in using LLMs for decision-making and questions their consistent application of reasoning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when evaluating professional candidates based on their resumes or curricula vitae (CVs). In an experiment involving 22 leading LLMs, each model was systematically given one job description along with a pair of profession-matched CVs, one bearing a male first name, the other a female first name, and asked to select the more suitable candidate for the job. Each CV pair was presented twice, with names swapped to ensure that any observed preferences in candidate selection stemmed from gendered names cues. Despite identical professional qualifications across genders, all LLMs consistently favored female-named candidates across 70 different professions. Adding an explicit gender field (male/female) to the CVs further increased the preference for female applicants. When gendered names were replaced with gender-neutral identifiers "Candidate A" and "Candidate B", several models displayed a preference to select "Candidate A". Counterbalancing gender assignment between these gender-neutral identifiers resulted in gender parity in candidate selection. When asked to rate CVs in isolation rather than compare pairs, LLMs assigned slightly higher average scores to female CVs overall, but the effect size was negligible. Including preferred pronouns (he/him or she/her) next to a candidate's name slightly increased the odds of the candidate being selected regardless of gender. Finally, most models exhibited a substantial positional bias to select the candidate listed first in the prompt. These findings underscore the need for caution when deploying LLMs in high-stakes autonomous decision-making contexts and raise doubts about whether LLMs consistently apply principled reasoning.

Project-Based Learning (PBL) involving multimodal data is essential in STEM education. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are being explored to enhance educational tasks. Existing benchmarks lack a free-form output structure and rigorous validation process. Automated pipelines leveraging MLLMs are limited due to model hallucination and instability. PBLBench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate complex reasoning in educational tasks with structured evaluation criteria derived from expert-driven pairwise comparisons. Performance evaluation of 15 MLLMs/LLMs on PBLBench shows significant challenges, with the most advanced models achieving only 59% rank accuracy. PBLBench aims to spur the development of more capable AI agents to support teachers and enhance educational productivity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Project-Based Learning (PBL) involves a variety of highly correlated multimodal data, making it a vital educational approach within STEM disciplines. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have begun exploring their potential to enhance tasks such as information retrieval, knowledge comprehension, and data generation in educational settings. However, existing benchmarks fall short in providing both a free-form output structure and a rigorous human expert validation process, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating real-world educational tasks. Additionally, few methods have developed automated pipelines to assist with the complex responsibilities of teachers leveraging MLLMs, largely due to model hallucination and instability, which lead to unreliable implementation. To address this gap, we introduce PBLBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate complex reasoning grounded in domain-specific knowledge and long-context understanding, thereby challenging models with tasks that closely resemble those handled by human experts. To establish reliable ground truth, we adopt the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), utilizing expert-driven pairwise comparisons to derive structured and weighted evaluation criteria. We assess the performance of 15 leading MLLMs/LLMs using PBLBench and demonstrate that even the most advanced models achieve only 59% rank accuracy, underscoring the significant challenges presented by this benchmark. We believe PBLBench will serve as a catalyst for the development of more capable AI agents, ultimately aiming to alleviate teacher workload and enhance educational productivity.

arXiv:2505.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating contextually relevant content. However, tailoring these outputs to individual users for effective personalization is a significant challenge. While rich user-specific information often exists as pre-existing user representations, such as embeddings learned from preferences or behaviors, current methods to leverage these for LLM personalization typically require costly fine-tuning or token-heavy prompting. We propose Embedding-to-Prefix (E2P), a parameter-efficient method that injects pre-computed context embeddings into an LLM's hidden representation space through a learned projection to a single soft token prefix. This enables effective personalization while keeping the backbone model frozen and avoiding expensive adaptation techniques. We evaluate E2P across two public datasets and in a production setting: dialogue personalization on Persona-Chat, contextual headline generation on PENS, and large-scale personalization for music and podcast consumption. Results show that E2P preserves contextual signals and achieves strong performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable, efficient solution for contextualizing generative AI systems.

We introduce SpecEdge, an edge-assisted inference framework that splits LLM workloads between edge and server GPUs using a speculative decoding scheme, exchanging only token outputs over the network. SpecEdge employs proactive edge drafting to overlap edge token creation with server verification and pipeline-aware scheduling that interleaves multiple user requests to increase server-side throughput. Experiments show SpecEdge enhances overall cost efficiency by 1.91x through achieving 2.22x server throughput, and reduces inter token latency by 11.24% compared to a server-only baseline, introducing a scalable, cost-effective paradigm for LLM serving.

<div> Keywords: large language models, social exchange, trust games, reciprocity, interactive reasoning

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4, Claude, and Bard were studied in economic trust games to understand their social exchange capabilities. LLMs showed tendencies towards trust and reciprocity, even without specific prompts. In short, one-shot interactions, LLMs displayed initial trust similar to humans. However, differences emerged in scenarios involving trust repayment and multi-round interactions, where social preferences and interactive reasoning played a significant role. LLM responses varied when prompted to adopt selfish or unselfish personas, with ChatGPT-4 excelling in unselfish or neutral personas. Claude and Bard exhibited varying levels of trust and reciprocity compared to humans. When given selfish personas, all LLMs displayed lower social behavior. Interactive reasoning in LLMs' responses seemed random, with some improvements noted when ChatGPT-4 responded as selfish or unselfish. <div>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding human languages, this study explores how they translate this understanding into social exchange contexts that capture certain essences of real world human interactions. Three LLMs - ChatGPT-4, Claude, and Bard - were placed in economic trust games where players balance self-interest with trust and reciprocity, making decisions that reveal their social preferences and interactive reasoning abilities. Our study shows that LLMs deviate from pure self-interest and exhibit trust and reciprocity even without being prompted to adopt a specific persona. In the simplest one-shot interaction, LLMs emulated how human players place trust at the beginning of such a game. Larger human-machine divergences emerged in scenarios involving trust repayment or multi-round interactions, where decisions were influenced by both social preferences and interactive reasoning. LLMs responses varied significantly when prompted to adopt personas like selfish or unselfish players, with the impact outweighing differences between models or game types. Response of ChatGPT-4, in an unselfish or neutral persona, resembled the highest trust and reciprocity, surpassing humans, Claude, and Bard. Claude and Bard displayed trust and reciprocity levels that sometimes exceeded and sometimes fell below human choices. When given selfish personas, all LLMs showed lower trust and reciprocity than humans. Interactive reasoning to the actions of counterparts or changing game mechanics appeared to be random rather than stable, reproducible characteristics in the response of LLMs, though some improvements were observed when ChatGPT-4 responded in selfish or unselfish personas.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer architectures have revolutionised natural language processing, but their application to healthcare domains presents unique challenges. Patient timelines are characterised by irregular sampling, variable temporal dependencies, and complex contextual relationships that differ substantially from traditional language tasks. This paper introduces \METHOD~(Modular Efficient Transformer for Health Outcome Discovery), a novel transformer architecture specifically designed to address the challenges of clinical sequence modelling in electronic health records. \METHOD~integrates three key innovations: (1) a patient-aware attention mechanism that prevents information leakage whilst enabling efficient batch processing; (2) an adaptive sliding window attention scheme that captures multi-scale temporal dependencies; and (3) a U-Net inspired architecture with dynamic skip connections for effective long sequence processing. Evaluations on the MIMIC-IV database demonstrate that \METHOD~consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art \ETHOS~model, particularly in predicting high-severity cases that require urgent clinical intervention. \METHOD~exhibits stable performance across varying inference lengths, a crucial feature for clinical deployment where patient histories vary significantly in length. Analysis of learned embeddings reveals that \METHOD~better preserves clinical hierarchies and relationships between medical concepts. These results suggest that \METHOD~represents a significant advancement in transformer architectures optimised for healthcare applications, providing more accurate and clinically relevant predictions whilst maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: AI is transforming education by enabling powerful tools that enhance learning experiences. Among recent advancements, large language models (LLMs) hold particular promise for revolutionizing how learners interact with educational content. In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs to support standardized test preparation by focusing on English Standardized Tests (ESTs). Specifically, we assess their ability to generate accurate and contextually appropriate solutions across a diverse set of EST question types. We introduce ESTBOOK, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving EST questions. ESTBOOK aggregates five widely recognized tests, encompassing 29 question types and over 10,576 questions across multiple modalities, including text, images, audio, tables, and mathematical symbols. Using ESTBOOK, we systematically evaluate both the accuracy and inference efficiency of LLMs. Additionally, we propose a breakdown analysis framework that decomposes complex EST questions into task-specific solution steps. This framework allows us to isolate and assess LLM performance at each stage of the reasoning process. Evaluation findings offer insights into the capability of LLMs in educational contexts and point toward targeted strategies for improving their reliability as intelligent tutoring systems.

arXiv:2505.17060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to enable fluid and natural human-machine speech interaction, existing full-duplex conversational systems often adopt modular architectures with auxiliary components such as voice activity detectors, interrupters, conversation state predictors, or multiple LLMs. These systems, however, suffer from error accumulation across modules and struggle with key challenges such as context-dependent barge-in and echo cancellation. Recent approaches, most notably Moshi, simplify the pipeline by injecting audio codecs into the token space of a single LLM. However, such methods still incur significant performance degradation when operating on the speech rather than text modality. In this paper, we introduce SALMONN-omni, the first single, standalone full-duplex speech LLM that operates without audio codecs in its token space. It features a novel dynamic thinking mechanism within the LLM backbone, enabling the model to learn when to transition between speaking and listening states. Experiments on widely used benchmarks for spoken question answering and open-domain dialogue show that SALMONN-omni achieves at least 30\% relative performance improvement over existing open-source full-duplex models and performs highly competitively to half-duplex and turn-based systems, despite using substantially less training data. Moreover, SALMONN-omni demonstrates strong performance in complex conversational scenarios, including turn-taking, backchanneling, echo cancellation and context-dependent barge-in, with further improvements achieved through reinforcement learning. Some demo conversations between user and SALMONN-omni are provided in the following repository https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN.

Summary:
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in various visual tasks but are plagued by hallucination issues. To tackle this problem, a novel approach called Mixture of Decoding (MoD) is proposed. MoD dynamically adjusts decoding strategies by evaluating the model's attention on image tokens. It measures consistency between outputs from original and attended image tokens to determine attention correctness. If outputs are consistent, MoD amplifies critical information; if inconsistent, it suppresses misleading information. Extensive experiments show that MoD outperforms existing methods in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs across multiple benchmarks. The code for MoD is available at https://github.com/xlchen0205/MoD.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across various visual tasks, yet they remain hindered by the persistent challenge of hallucinations. To address this critical issue, we propose Mixture of Decoding (MoD), a novel approach for hallucination mitigation that dynamically adapts decoding strategies by evaluating the correctness of the model's attention on image tokens. Specifically, MoD measures the consistency between outputs generated from the original image tokens and those derived from the model's attended image tokens, to distinguish the correctness aforementioned. If the outputs are consistent, indicating correct attention, MoD employs a complementary strategy to amplify critical information. Conversely, if the outputs are inconsistent, suggesting erroneous attention, MoD utilizes a contrastive strategy to suppress misleading information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoD significantly outperforms existing decoding methods across multiple mainstream benchmarks, effectively mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/xlchen0205/MoD.

Summary:
The article introduces Synthetic Data RL, a framework for reinforcement learning that fine-tunes models using only synthetic data generated from a task definition. The method generates question-answer pairs, adjusts question difficulty based on model solvability, and selects questions for RL training based on model pass rates. Results show significant improvements over base models on various tasks such as GSM8K, MATH, GPQA, MedQA, CQA (law), and CFA (finance). The approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning and nearly matches RL with full human data, with minimal added value from human demonstrations. By reducing the reliance on human-labeled data, Synthetic Data RL enables scalable and efficient model adaptation through reinforcement learning. The code and demos for this method are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful way to adapt foundation models to specialized tasks, but its reliance on large-scale human-labeled data limits broad adoption. We introduce Synthetic Data RL, a simple and general framework that reinforcement fine-tunes models using only synthetic data generated from a task definition. Our method first generates question and answer pairs from the task definition and retrieved documents, then adapts the difficulty of the question based on model solvability, and selects questions using the average pass rate of the model across samples for RL training. On Qwen-2.5-7B, our method achieves a 29.2% absolute improvement over the base model on GSM8K (+2.9 pp vs. instruction-tuned, +6.6 pp vs. Self-Instruct), 8.7% on MATH, 13.1% on GPQA (+7.0 pp vs. SynthLLM), 8.9% on MedQA, 17.7% on CQA (law) and 13.7% on CFA (finance). It surpasses supervised fine-tuning under the same data budget and nearly matches RL with full human data across datasets (e.g., +17.2 pp on GSM8K). Adding 100 human demonstrations improves the performance of GSM8K only by 0.4 pp, showing a limited added value. By reducing human data annotation, Synthetic Data RL enables scalable and efficient RL-based model adaptation. Code and demos are available at https://github.com/gydpku/Data_Synthesis_RL/.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models LLMs, have shown promising capabilities in transforming rare disease research. This survey paper explores the integration of LLMs in the analysis of rare diseases, highlighting significant strides and pivotal studies that leverage textual data to uncover insights and patterns critical for diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. While current research predominantly employs textual data, the potential for multimodal data integration combining genetic, imaging, and electronic health records stands as a promising frontier. We review foundational papers that demonstrate the application of LLMs in identifying and extracting relevant medical information, simulating intelligent conversational agents for patient interaction, and enabling the formulation of accurate and timely diagnoses. Furthermore, this paper discusses the challenges and ethical considerations inherent in deploying LLMs, including data privacy, model transparency, and the need for robust, inclusive data sets. As part of this exploration, we present a section on experimentation that utilizes multiple LLMs alongside structured questionnaires, specifically designed for diagnostic purposes in the context of different diseases.

Summary:
- The study addresses the challenge of detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) from picture descriptions, particularly in multilingual and multiple picture settings.
- The proposed framework consists of three components: enhancing discriminative representation learning through supervised contrastive learning, incorporating the image modality, and utilizing a Product of Experts strategy to reduce spurious correlations and overfitting.
- The framework significantly improves MCI detection performance, achieving a 7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) and a 2.9% increase in F1 score compared to the text unimodal baseline.
- The contrastive learning component particularly benefits the text modality over speech.
- These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.

Summary: 
This paper discusses the importance of ASR endpointing (EP) in enhancing user experience in human-machine conversations. The focus is on addressing the delayed emission issue in transducer-based ASR (T-ASR). The proposed method introduces an end-of-word token and a delay penalty to mitigate delayed emission, improving the accuracy of EP. Additionally, a reliable frame-level speech activity detection using an auxiliary network is employed to tackle EP delays. Experimental evaluations on Switchboard conversational speech corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in comparison to delay penalty techniques. Overall, the study emphasizes the significance of timely and accurate EP in ensuring seamless communication between users and ASR systems, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.17070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ASR endpointing (EP) plays a major role in delivering a good user experience in products supporting human or artificial agents in human-human/machine conversations. Transducer-based ASR (T-ASR) is an end-to-end (E2E) ASR modelling technique preferred for streaming. A major limitation of T-ASR is delayed emission of ASR outputs, which could lead to errors or delays in EP. Inaccurate EP will cut the user off while speaking, returning incomplete transcript while delays in EP will increase the perceived latency, degrading the user experience. We propose methods to improve EP by addressing delayed emission along with EP mistakes. To address the delayed emission problem, we introduce an end-of-word token at the end of each word, along with a delay penalty. The EP delay is addressed by obtaining a reliable frame-level speech activity detection using an auxiliary network. We apply the proposed methods on Switchboard conversational speech corpus and evaluate it against a delay penalty method.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models use high-dimensional latent spaces to encode and process textual information. Much work has investigated how the conceptual content of words translates into geometrical relationships between their vector representations. Fewer studies analyze how the cumulative information of an entire prompt becomes condensed into individual embeddings under the action of transformer layers. We use literary pieces to show that information about intangible, rather than factual, aspects of the prompt are contained in deep representations. We observe that short excerpts (10 - 100 tokens) from different novels separate in the latent space independently from what next-token prediction they converge towards. Ensembles from books from the same authors are much more entangled than across authors, suggesting that embeddings encode stylistic features. This geometry of style may have applications for authorship attribution and literary analysis, but most importantly reveals the sophistication of information processing and compression accomplished by language models.

Summary: 
This paper introduces an interpretability framework for analyzing how GPT-like models adapt to summarization tasks. The study focuses on differential analysis between pre-trained and fine-tuned models, identifying specific layers and attention heads that undergo significant transformation during summarization. The research reveals that middle layers, particularly layers 2, 3, and 5, experience the most significant changes, with a shift toward focused information selection observed in 62% of attention heads. Targeted LoRA adaptation of these identified circuits leads to improved performance in summarization tasks with fewer training epochs required. By bridging the gap between black-box evaluation and mechanistic understanding, the study provides valuable insights into how neural networks handle information selection and compression in summarization processes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research seeks to reveal the inner workings of large language models, yet most work focuses on classification or generative tasks rather than summarization. This paper presents an interpretability framework for analyzing how GPT-like models adapt to summarization tasks. We conduct differential analysis between pre-trained and fine-tuned models, quantifying changes in attention patterns and internal activations. By identifying specific layers and attention heads that undergo significant transformation, we locate the "summarization circuit" within the model architecture. Our findings reveal that middle layers (particularly 2, 3, and 5) exhibit the most dramatic changes, with 62% of attention heads showing decreased entropy, indicating a shift toward focused information selection. We demonstrate that targeted LoRA adaptation of these identified circuits achieves significant performance improvement over standard LoRA fine-tuning while requiring fewer training epochs. This work bridges the gap between black-box evaluation and mechanistic understanding, providing insights into how neural networks perform information selection and compression during summarization.

<div> Scheduling, Large Language Model, Inference, Speculative Decoding, Execution Time
<br />
Summary:
<br />
The paper introduces a new request scheduling algorithm, LAPS-SD, for Large Language Model (LLM) inference with speculative decoding. The algorithm aims to minimize average inference latency by adaptively scheduling requests based on their features during decoding. LAPS-SD addresses the challenge of uncertain execution time in inference requests, considering both output length and token acceptance rate of the LLM for accurate estimation. It utilizes multiple priority queues to manage dynamic token acceptance rates and allows request execution preemption. Once the token acceptance rate stabilizes, LAPS-SD can accurately estimate execution time and optimize request scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction of approximately 39% in inference latency compared to existing scheduling methods, showcasing the effectiveness of LAPS-SD in improving the efficiency of LLM inference serving systems.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by employing a small speculative model (SSM) to generate multiple candidate tokens and verify them using the LLM in parallel. This technique has been widely integrated into LLM inference serving systems. However, inference requests typically exhibit uncertain execution time, which poses a significant challenge of efficiently scheduling requests in these systems. Existing work estimates execution time based solely on predicted output length, which could be inaccurate because execution time depends on both output length and token acceptance rate of verification by the LLM. In this paper, we propose a semi-clairvoyant request scheduling algorithm called Least-Attained/Perceived-Service for Speculative Decoding (LAPS-SD). Given a number of inference requests, LAPS-SD can effectively minimize average inference latency by adaptively scheduling requests according to their features during decoding. When the token acceptance rate is dynamic and execution time is difficult to estimate, LAPS-SD maintains multiple priority queues and allows request execution preemption across different queues. Once the token acceptance rate becomes stable, LAPS-SD can accurately estimate the execution time and schedule requests accordingly. Extensive experiments show that LAPS-SD reduces inference latency by approximately 39\% compared to state-of-the-art scheduling methods.

Summary:
The study developed and validated two scales of engagement and rapport to assess user experience quality with multimodal dialogue systems in foreign language learning. The scales were based on theories from various fields. Japanese learners of English engaged in tasks with human tutors and a dialog agent, responding to the scales afterward. Cronbach's alpha and confirmatory factor analyses were used to test validity and reliability. Comparison of scores between human tutors and the dialog agent showed the scales effectively captured differences in dialogue experience quality. The scales were successful in evaluating engagement and rapport in dialogue with human interlocutors versus a dialogue agent in a variety of aspects.

Abstract: This study aimed to develop and validate two scales of engagement and rapport to evaluate the user experience quality with multimodal dialogue systems in the context of foreign language learning. The scales were designed based on theories of engagement in educational psychology, social psychology, and second language acquisition.Seventy-four Japanese learners of English completed roleplay and discussion tasks with trained human tutors and a dialog agent. After each dialogic task was completed, they responded to the scales of engagement and rapport. The validity and reliability of the scales were investigated through two analyses. We first conducted analysis of Cronbach's alpha coefficient and a series of confirmatory factor analyses to test the structural validity of the scales and the reliability of our designed items. We then compared the scores of engagement and rapport between the dialogue with human tutors and the one with a dialogue agent. The results revealed that our scales succeeded in capturing the difference in the dialogue experience quality between the human interlocutors and the dialogue agent from multiple perspectives.

Summary:<br /><br />
This study explores the impact of frame rates on speech tokenization for Mandarin and English languages. The research investigates how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization and evaluates semantic tokens in speech recognition tasks. The findings indicate that frame rate variations influence speech tokenization differently for each language, emphasizing the connection between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features. The results offer insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and other speech-related applications. <div>

Abstract: The speech tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally serving as a bridge between speech signals and language models. While low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features. The results provide insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and other speech-related applications.

<div> Keywords: toxicity generation, Large Language Models, Feed-Forward Network, toxic subspace, GloSS

Summary:
This paper explores the mechanisms of toxicity creation in Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces a novel detoxification method called GloSS (Global Toxic Subspace Suppression). Previous research focused on the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) as the source of toxicity, but the authors reveal that the global toxic subspace provides a more comprehensive representation of toxic regions in the model. GloSS consists of four stages and effectively mitigates toxicity by identifying and eliminating the global toxic subspace from the FFN parameters. The experiments conducted on various LLMs demonstrate that GloSS achieves superior detoxification performance while maintaining the model's overall capabilities. Importantly, GloSS does not require extensive data or retraining of the model, making it a lightweight and efficient solution for addressing toxicity in LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: This paper delves into the root causes of toxicity in Large Language Models, presenting GloSS as a groundbreaking approach to detoxify models by targeting the global toxic subspace within the Feed-Forward Network. The proposed method outperforms existing techniques, effectively reducing toxicity without compromising the models' general capabilities, and proving to be a practical solution that does not necessitate extensive data or model retraining. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of toxicity generation in Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes an effective detoxification approach. Prior work typically considers the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) as the main source of toxicity, representing toxic regions as a set of toxic vectors or layer-wise subspaces. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that the global toxic subspace offers a more effective and comprehensive representation of toxic region within the model. Building on this insight, we propose GloSS (Global Toxic Subspace Suppression), a lightweight, four-stage method that mitigates toxicity by identifying and removing the global toxic subspace from the parameters of FFN. Experiments across a range of LLMs show that GloSS achieves state-of-the-art detoxification performance while preserving the models general capabilities, without requiring large-scale data or model retraining.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, semiotic perspective, meaning-making, interpretive acts, cultural production

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are often framed as cognitive systems, but this paper argues for a semiotic perspective instead. LLMs are seen as agents that manipulate and circulate linguistic forms based on probabilistic associations, rather than understanding language like humans. By shifting to this framework, we avoid anthropomorphism and gain a more precise understanding of how LLMs participate in cultural processes through generating interpretive texts. LLMs can be used in literature, philosophy, education, and cultural production to facilitate creativity, dialogue, and critical inquiry. The semiotic paradigm highlights the socially embedded nature of meaning, providing a more ethically aware framework for studying and using LLMs. Ultimately, LLMs are portrayed as technological participants in the ecology of signs, influencing how we read, write, and create meaning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper challenges the prevailing tendency to frame Large Language Models (LLMs) as cognitive systems, arguing instead for a semiotic perspective that situates these models within the broader dynamics of sign manipulation and meaning-making. Rather than assuming that LLMs understand language or simulate human thought, we propose that their primary function is to recombine, recontextualize, and circulate linguistic forms based on probabilistic associations. By shifting from a cognitivist to a semiotic framework, we avoid anthropomorphism and gain a more precise understanding of how LLMs participate in cultural processes, not by thinking, but by generating texts that invite interpretation. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, the paper demonstrates how LLMs function as semiotic agents whose outputs can be treated as interpretive acts, open to contextual negotiation and critical reflection. We explore applications in literature, philosophy, education, and cultural production, emphasizing how LLMs can serve as tools for creativity, dialogue, and critical inquiry. The semiotic paradigm foregrounds the situated, contingent, and socially embedded nature of meaning, offering a more rigorous and ethically aware framework for studying and using LLMs. Ultimately, this approach reframes LLMs as technological participants in an ongoing ecology of signs. They do not possess minds, but they alter how we read, write, and make meaning, compelling us to reconsider the foundations of language, interpretation, and the role of artificial systems in the production of knowledge.

<div> Keywords: Moroccan Arabic, large language models, Darija, cross-lingual reasoning, GemMaroc

Summary:
Open-source large language models often do not adequately support Moroccan Arabic (Darija), leading to the need for complex adaptations. This study introduces a strategy to efficiently align Darija with large language models while maintaining cross-lingual reasoning skills. By translating compact instruction suites into Darija and training models with a quality-over-quantity approach, the researchers successfully enhance Darija language understanding and commonsense reasoning abilities. The resulting model, GemMaroc-27B, performs competitively on Darija language tasks and surpasses existing models on Darija commonsense challenges. Importantly, GemMaroc-27B retains strong mathematical and general reasoning capabilities while being trained in a significantly reduced amount of compute time. This approach demonstrates a sustainable and inclusive pathway for developing language technology that supports minority languages like Darija. Code, data, and checkpoints are released to encourage the development of Darija-focused applications in various domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) still marginalise Moroccan Arabic (Darija), forcing practitioners either to bolt on heavyweight Arabic adapters or to sacrifice the very reasoning skills that make LLMs useful. We show that a rigorously quality-over-quantity alignment strategy can surface fluent Darija while safeguarding the backbone s cross-lingual reasoning at a sliver of the usual compute. We translate three compact instruction suites LIMA 1 K, DEITA 6 K and TULU 50 K into Darija, preserve 20 of the English originals, and add mathematics, coding and scientific prompts. A LoRA-tuned Gemma 3-4B trained on 5 K mixed instructions lifts DarijaMMLU from 32.8 to 42.7 ; adding the reasoning-dense TULU portion pushes it to 47.5 with no English regression. Scaling the identical recipe to Gemma 3-27B produces GemMaroc-27B, which matches Atlas-Chat on DarijaMMLU (61.6 ) and leaps ahead on Darija commonsense, scoring 60.5 on HellaSwag versus Atlas-Chat s 48.4 . Crucially, GemMaroc retains Gemma-27B s strong maths and general-reasoning ability, showing only minimal movement on GSM8K and English benchmarks. The entire model is trained in just 48 GPU.h, underscoring a Green AI pathway to inclusive, sustainable language technology. We release code, data and checkpoints to spur Darija-centric applications in education, public services and everyday digital interaction.

Summary:
scale-invariant total attention and scale-invariant attention sparsity are two crucial conditions for effective long-context attention mechanisms. A position-dependent transformation of attention logits under a Gaussian assumption can ensure these conditions are met. Experimental results show that this scale-invariant attention scheme provides significant improvements in validation loss when transitioning from training on short contexts to validation on longer contexts, and is effective for long-context retrieval in Language Model research. <div>
arXiv:2505.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One persistent challenge in LLM research is the development of attention mechanisms that are able to generalise from training on shorter contexts to inference on longer contexts. We propose two conditions that we expect all effective long context attention mechanisms to have: scale-invariant total attention, and scale-invariant attention sparsity. Under a Gaussian assumption, we show that a simple position-dependent transformation of the attention logits is sufficient for these conditions to hold. Experimentally we find that the resulting scale-invariant attention scheme gives considerable benefits in terms of validation loss when zero-shot generalising from training on short contexts to validation on longer contexts, and is effective at long-context retrieval.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are versatile but struggle with factual knowledge in Question Answering tasks. Mujica, a Multi-hop Joint Intelligence system, decomposes questions into subquestions and resolves them via retrieval and reasoning. MyGO, a novel reinforcement learning method, enhances training efficiency by sampling trajectories from an optimal policy. This approach eliminates the need for gradient rescaling and reference models, leading to stable and effective multi-hop QA performance for various LLMs. Empirical results across datasets validate Mujica-MyGO's scalability and resource efficiency for complex QA tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility, due to the lack of factual knowledge, their application to Question Answering (QA) tasks remains hindered by hallucination.
  While Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by integrating external knowledge, existing approaches rely heavily on in-context learning, whose performance is constrained by the fundamental reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
  In this paper, we propose Mujica, a Multi-hop Joint Intelligence for Complex Question Answering, comprising a planner that decomposes questions into a directed acyclic graph of subquestions and a worker that resolves questions via retrieval and reasoning. Additionally, we introduce MyGO (Minimalist policy Gradient Optimization), a novel reinforcement learning method that replaces traditional policy gradient updates with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) by sampling trajectories from an asymptotically optimal policy. MyGO eliminates the need for gradient rescaling and reference models, ensuring stable and efficient training.
  Empirical results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Mujica-MyGO in enhancing multi-hop QA performance for various LLMs, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for complex QA tasks.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but face various safety risks such as jailbreaks, toxic content, hallucinations, and bias. Traditional defenses are often limited in addressing these risks and may sacrifice user experience. This paper introduces Adversarial Scenario Extrapolation (ASE), a new framework that uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning to enhance LLM robustness and seamlessness. ASE guides the LLM to consider potential adversarial scenarios and formulate defensive strategies before generating a response, leading to near-zero jailbreak attack success rates and minimal toxicity. Evaluation on multiple benchmarks showcases ASE's superiority over existing defenses in achieving high accuracy on adversarial Q&amp;A and reducing bias. By integrating adversarial perception into the LLM's cognitive process, ASE sets a new standard for secure and natural human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, but remain susceptible to a growing spectrum of safety risks, including jailbreaks, toxic content, hallucinations, and bias. Existing defenses often address only a single threat type or resort to rigid outright rejection, sacrificing user experience and failing to generalize across diverse and novel attacks. This paper introduces Adversarial Scenario Extrapolation (ASE), a novel inference-time computation framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to simultaneously enhance LLM robustness and seamlessness. ASE guides the LLM through a self-generative process of contemplating potential adversarial scenarios and formulating defensive strategies before generating a response to the user query. Comprehensive evaluation on four adversarial benchmarks with four latest LLMs shows that ASE achieves near-zero jailbreak attack success rates and minimal toxicity, while slashing outright rejections to <4%. ASE outperforms six state-of-the-art defenses in robustness-seamlessness trade-offs, with 92-99% accuracy on adversarial Q&amp;A and 4-10x lower bias scores. By transforming adversarial perception into an intrinsic cognitive process, ASE sets a new paradigm for secure and natural human-AI interaction.

<div> Keywords: auto-regressive LLM model, text tokens, image understanding, audio processing, classification pipeline 

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach where an auto-regressive LLM model trained on text tokens exhibits an inherent ability to comprehend images and audio through text. Unlike traditional models that fine-tune text LLMs for image and audio conditioning, this architecture directly processes image patches, audio waveforms, or tokens to generate embeddings or classification labels. The study demonstrates the versatility of leveraging text weights to enhance audio classification on datasets like FSD-50K and GTZAN, as well as image classification tasks on CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, and image patches. This approach underscores the potential of text-LLMs to develop versatile internal circuits that can be repurposed for diverse applications, eliminating the need to train separate models for individual tasks. <div>
arXiv:2505.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.

Summary: <br />
This study evaluates the reliability of 12 open-weight and proprietary large language models from different companies in generating clinical notes. The focus is on consistency, semantic consistency, and accuracy of the notes. Results show that all models are stable and provide semantically consistent responses. Most of the generated notes closely match expert notes, with Meta's Llama 70B and Mistral's Small model being the most reliable. The study recommends the use of smaller open-weight models for clinical note generation to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and enhance healthcare providers' efficiency in documentation. <div>

Abstract: Due to the legal and ethical responsibilities of healthcare providers (HCPs) for accurate documentation and protection of patient data privacy, the natural variability in the responses of large language models (LLMs) presents challenges for incorporating clinical note generation (CNG) systems, driven by LLMs, into real-world clinical processes. The complexity is further amplified by the detailed nature of texts in CNG. To enhance the confidence of HCPs in tools powered by LLMs, this study evaluates the reliability of 12 open-weight and proprietary LLMs from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and OpenAI in CNG in terms of their ability to generate notes that are string equivalent (consistency rate), have the same meaning (semantic consistency) and are correct (semantic similarity), across several iterations using the same prompt. The results show that (1) LLMs from all model families are stable, such that their responses are semantically consistent despite being written in various ways, and (2) most of the LLMs generated notes close to the corresponding notes made by experts. Overall, Meta's Llama 70B was the most reliable, followed by Mistral's Small model. With these findings, we recommend the local deployment of these relatively smaller open-weight models for CNG to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations, as well as to improve the efficiency of HCPs in clinical documentation.

Summary:
TACO, a transformer-based model, incorporates task-aware attention to dynamically configure in-context sequences, leveraging task-mapping signals for bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Through systematic interpretation of multimodal in-context learning, the study sheds light on how large vision-language models utilize in-context sequences during inference. Task mapping proves to be a valuable perspective for enhancing multimodal in-context learning, as demonstrated by TACO outperforming baselines across various tasks and datasets.

arXiv:2505.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for harnessing the capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input in-context sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures in-context sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a valuable perspective for interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.

<div> Generative Models, Brain Decoding, EEG, Text Generation, GLIM <br />
<br />
Summary: 
This paper discusses the issue of hallucination in EEG-to-text decoding using generative models. The authors propose the Generative Language Inspection Model (GLIM) to improve semantic grounding by focusing on core meanings rather than verbatim reconstruction. GLIM learns informative EEG representations to generate fluent, EEG-grounded sentences without teacher forcing. Experiments on the ZuCo dataset show that GLIM produces reliable outputs and supports robust evaluation through EEG-text retrieval and zero-shot semantic classification. The study aims to address the reliability and scalability of generative brain decoding by providing a solid benchmark for future research. <div>

Abstract: Pretrained generative models have opened new frontiers in brain decoding by enabling the synthesis of realistic texts and images from non-invasive brain recordings. However, the reliability of such outputs remains questionable--whether they truly reflect semantic activation in the brain, or are merely hallucinated by the powerful generative models. In this paper, we focus on EEG-to-text decoding and address its hallucination issue through the lens of posterior collapse. Acknowledging the underlying mismatch in information capacity between EEG and text, we reframe the decoding task as semantic summarization of core meanings rather than previously verbatim reconstruction of stimulus texts. To this end, we propose the Generative Language Inspection Model (GLIM), which emphasizes learning informative and interpretable EEG representations to improve semantic grounding under heterogeneous and small-scale data conditions. Experiments on the public ZuCo dataset demonstrate that GLIM consistently generates fluent, EEG-grounded sentences without teacher forcing. Moreover, it supports more robust evaluation beyond text similarity, through EEG-text retrieval and zero-shot semantic classification across sentiment categories, relation types, and corpus topics. Together, our architecture and evaluation protocols lay the foundation for reliable and scalable benchmarking in generative brain decoding.

<div> Judge, Bias Detector, Evaluation, Reasoning, LLM 

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Reasoning-based Bias Detector (RBD) as a tool to identify biased evaluations and provide structured reasoning for self-correction. RBD operates externally, engaging in an iterative process of bias detection and feedback-driven revision. A complete pipeline is designed for RBD development, including biased dataset construction, supervision collection, and fine-tuning of RBD models ranging from 1.5B to 14B. Experimental results show RBD's strong effectiveness in improving evaluation accuracy and consistency across bias types such as verbosity, position, bandwagon, and sentiment. RBD outperforms prompting-based baselines and fine-tuned judges, demonstrating scalability, generalization across biases and domains, and efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2505.17100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising tool for automatically evaluating generated outputs, but its reliability is often undermined by potential biases in judgment. Existing efforts to mitigate these biases face key limitations: in-context learning-based methods fail to address rooted biases due to the evaluator's limited capacity for self-reflection, whereas fine-tuning is not applicable to all evaluator types, especially closed-source models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Reasoning-based Bias Detector (RBD), which is a plug-in module that identifies biased evaluations and generates structured reasoning to guide evaluator self-correction. Rather than modifying the evaluator itself, RBD operates externally and engages in an iterative process of bias detection and feedback-driven revision. To support its development, we design a complete pipeline consisting of biased dataset construction, supervision collection, distilled reasoning-based fine-tuning of RBD, and integration with LLM evaluators. We fine-tune four sizes of RBD models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B, and observe consistent performance improvements across all scales. Experimental results on 4 bias types--verbosity, position, bandwagon, and sentiment--evaluated using 8 LLM evaluators demonstrate RBD's strong effectiveness. For example, the RBD-8B model improves evaluation accuracy by an average of 18.5% and consistency by 10.9%, and surpasses prompting-based baselines and fine-tuned judges by 12.8% and 17.2%, respectively. These results highlight RBD's effectiveness and scalability. Additional experiments further demonstrate its strong generalization across biases and domains, as well as its efficiency.

<div> Keywords: deep neural networks, semantic information, language models, vision transformers, information asymmetry

Summary:
The study investigates how deep neural networks process semantically related data across different domains. It focuses on language models (LLMs) and vision transformers, analyzing the information content and transferability of representations. Through experiments with translated sentences, the researchers identify inner layers in LLMs that contain highly transferable semantic information. They find that larger LLMs extract more general information compared to smaller ones, with semantic information distributed across multiple tokens. Additionally, semantic layers within visual transformers encode meaningful visual and textual representations, showing predictive capabilities between captions and images. The study highlights significant information asymmetries between image and text representations, with observations of long-distance correlations and causal left-to-right asymmetries in processing semantic information. This research provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of similar representations in deep neural networks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various natural language processing tasks. However, most LLM models use traditional tokenizers like BPE and SentencePiece, which fail to capture the finer nuances of a morphologically rich language like Bangla (Bengali). In this work, we introduce BanglaByT5, the first byte-level encoder-decoder model explicitly tailored for Bangla. Built upon a small variant of Googles ByT5 architecture, BanglaByT5 is pre-trained on a 14GB curated corpus combining high-quality literary and newspaper articles. Through zeroshot and supervised evaluations across generative and classification tasks, BanglaByT5 demonstrates competitive performance, surpassing several multilingual and larger models. Our findings highlight the efficacy of byte-level modelling for morphologically rich languages and highlight BanglaByT5 potential as a lightweight yet powerful tool for Bangla NLP, particularly in both resource-constrained and scalable environments.

Abstract: SDForger is a flexible and efficient framework for generating high-quality multivariate time series using LLMs. Leveraging a compact data representation, SDForger provides synthetic time series generation from a few samples and low-computation fine-tuning of any autoregressive LLM. Specifically, the framework transforms univariate and multivariate signals into tabular embeddings, which are then encoded into text and used to fine-tune the LLM. At inference, new textual embeddings are sampled and decoded into synthetic time series that retain the original data's statistical properties and temporal dynamics. Across a diverse range of datasets, SDForger outperforms existing generative models in many scenarios, both in similarity-based evaluations and downstream forecasting tasks. By enabling textual conditioning in the generation process, SDForger paves the way for multimodal modeling and the streamlined integration of time series with textual information. SDForger source code will be open-sourced soon.

Summary: 
The article introduces P2P, a multi-agent framework based on LLM technology, designed to automatically generate high-quality academic posters from research papers. Three specialized agents work together to process visual elements, generate content, and assemble the final poster, ensuring output quality through iterative refinement. The framework is supported by P2PInstruct, a dataset of over 30,000 examples for training, and P2PEval, a benchmark with 121 paper-poster pairs for evaluation. The evaluation methodology includes both Universal and Fine-Grained assessment using LLM technology and human-annotated checklists.

Abstract: Academic posters are vital for scholarly communication, yet their manual creation is time-consuming. However, automated academic poster generation faces significant challenges in preserving intricate scientific details and achieving effective visual-textual integration. Existing approaches often struggle with semantic richness and structural nuances, and lack standardized benchmarks for evaluating generated academic posters comprehensively. To address these limitations, we introduce P2P, the first flexible, LLM-based multi-agent framework that generates high-quality, HTML-rendered academic posters directly from research papers, demonstrating strong potential for practical applications. P2P employs three specialized agents-for visual element processing, content generation, and final poster assembly-each integrated with dedicated checker modules to enable iterative refinement and ensure output quality. To foster advancements and rigorous evaluation in this domain, we construct and release P2PInstruct, the first large-scale instruction dataset comprising over 30,000 high-quality examples tailored for the academic paper-to-poster generation task. Furthermore, we establish P2PEval, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 121 paper-poster pairs and a dual evaluation methodology (Universal and Fine-Grained) that leverages LLM-as-a-Judge and detailed, human-annotated checklists. Our contributions aim to streamline research dissemination and provide the community with robust tools for developing and evaluating next-generation poster generation systems.

Summary: 
- RLLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, were evaluated using a red teaming approach called RRTL to assess their safety in tool learning.
- Two strategies, identifying deceptive threats and using CoT prompting, were integrated into the evaluation process.
- Seven mainstream RLLMs were tested, revealing that while RLLMs generally have stronger safety performance than traditional LLMs, safety disparities still exist among models.
- RLLMs were found to have deceptive risks, as they often fail to disclose tool usage and warn users about potential risks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While tool learning significantly enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), it also introduces substantial security risks. Prior research has revealed various vulnerabilities in traditional LLMs during tool learning. However, the safety of newly emerging reasoning LLMs (RLLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, in the context of tool learning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose RRTL, a red teaming approach specifically designed to evaluate RLLMs in tool learning. It integrates two novel strategies: (1) the identification of deceptive threats, which evaluates the model's behavior in concealing the usage of unsafe tools and their potential risks; and (2) the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to force tool invocation. Our approach also includes a benchmark for traditional LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on seven mainstream RLLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) RLLMs generally achieve stronger safety performance than traditional LLMs, yet substantial safety disparities persist across models; (2) RLLMs can pose serious deceptive risks by frequently failing to disclose tool usage and to warn users of potential tool output risks; (3) CoT prompting reveals multi-lingual safety vulnerabilities in RLLMs. Our work provides important insights into enhancing the security of RLLMs in tool learning.

<div> multimodal language models, multimodal encoders, MMER, multimodal expansion, catastrophic forgetting<br />
Summary:<br /> 
The paper introduces MMER, a novel approach for expanding the multimodal capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for resource-intensive fine-tuning. MMER combines existing Multimodal LLMs by reusing their multimodal encoders and merging their LLM parameters. By generating binary masks to separate the parameters for each modality, MMER enables the independent processing of modality-specific inputs, reducing conflicts and maintaining the fidelity of the original models. Additionally, MMER can mitigate catastrophic forgetting by decoupling parameters in MLLMs fine-tuned on new tasks. Experimental results show that MMER significantly improves multimodal capabilities while retaining 99% of the original performance and effectively addressing catastrophic forgetting. <div>

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal encoders on modality-specific data expands the modalities that LLMs can handle, leading to the formation of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, this paradigm heavily relies on resource-intensive and inflexible fine-tuning from scratch with new multimodal data. In this paper, we propose MMER (Multi-modality Expansion and Retention), a training-free approach that integrates existing MLLMs for effective multimodal expansion while retaining their original performance. Specifically, MMER reuses MLLMs' multimodal encoders while merging their LLM parameters. By comparing original and merged LLM parameters, MMER generates binary masks to approximately separate LLM parameters for each modality. These decoupled parameters can independently process modality-specific inputs, reducing parameter conflicts and preserving original MLLMs' fidelity. MMER can also mitigate catastrophic forgetting by applying a similar process to MLLMs fine-tuned on new tasks. Extensive experiments show significant improvements over baselines, proving that MMER effectively expands LLMs' multimodal capabilities while retaining 99% of the original performance, and also markedly mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: This study examines cultural value alignment in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing how Gemini, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek prioritize values from Schwartz's value framework. Using the 40-item Portrait Values Questionnaire, we assessed whether DeepSeek, trained on Chinese-language data, exhibits distinct value preferences compared to Western models. Results of a Bayesian ordinal regression model show that self-transcendence values (e.g., benevolence, universalism) were highly prioritized across all models, reflecting a general LLM tendency to emphasize prosocial values. However, DeepSeek uniquely downplayed self-enhancement values (e.g., power, achievement) compared to ChatGPT and Gemini, aligning with collectivist cultural tendencies. These findings suggest that LLMs reflect culturally situated biases rather than a universal ethical framework. To address value asymmetries in LLMs, we propose multi-perspective reasoning, self-reflective feedback, and dynamic contextualization. This study contributes to discussions on AI fairness, cultural neutrality, and the need for pluralistic AI alignment frameworks that integrate diverse moral perspectives.

Summary: 
The paper introduces RAVEN, a multimodal question answering (QA) architecture that uses a query-conditioned cross-modal gating module called QuART to assign relevance scores to tokens across modalities. The model is trained through a three-stage pipeline focusing on representation quality, cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. The architecture is evaluated on seven QA benchmarks, showing significant improvements in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, especially when incorporating sensor data. RAVEN demonstrates robustness to modality corruption, outperforming baselines by a large margin. The AVS-QA dataset, comprising synchronized audio, video, and sensor data along with question-answer pairs, is released to support training and evaluation. The code and dataset are available on GitHub, making RAVEN a valuable resource for researchers working on multimodal QA tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video, audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a distinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality, cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized Audio--Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including egocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\% and 8.0\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4\% boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming SOTA baselines by 50.23\%. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BASHLab/RAVEN.

<title>From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning</title>

arXiv:2505.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more human-aligned conceptual representations.

arXiv:2505.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face critical challenges in balancing internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge, especially when these sources conflict or are unreliable. To analyze these scenarios comprehensively, we construct the Trustworthiness Response Dataset (TRD) with 36,266 questions spanning four RAG settings. We reveal that existing approaches address isolated scenarios-prioritizing one knowledge source, naively merging both, or refusing answers-but lack a unified framework to handle different real-world conditions simultaneously. Therefore, we propose the BRIDGE framework, which dynamically determines a comprehensive response strategy of large language models (LLMs). BRIDGE leverages an adaptive weighting mechanism named soft bias to guide knowledge collection, followed by a Maximum Soft-bias Decision Tree to evaluate knowledge and select optimal response strategies (trust internal/external knowledge, or refuse). Experiments show BRIDGE outperforms baselines by 5-15% in accuracy while maintaining balanced performance across all scenarios. Our work provides an effective solution for LLMs' trustworthy responses in real-world RAG applications.

<title>Systematic Evaluation of Machine-Generated Reasoning and PHQ-9 Labeling for Depression Detection Using Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) for early mental health detection, such as depression, often optimized with machine-generated data. However, their detection may be subject to unknown weaknesses. Meanwhile, quality control has not been applied to these generated corpora besides limited human verifications. Our goal is to systematically evaluate LLM reasoning and reveal potential weaknesses. To this end, we first provide a systematic evaluation of the reasoning over machine-generated detection and interpretation. Then we use the models' reasoning abilities to explore mitigation strategies for enhanced performance. Specifically, we do the following: A. Design an LLM instruction strategy that allows for systematic analysis of the detection by breaking down the task into several subtasks. B. Design contrastive few-shot and chain-of-thought prompts by selecting typical positive and negative examples of detection reasoning. C. Perform human annotation for the subtasks identified in the first step and evaluate the performance. D. Identify human-preferred detection with desired logical reasoning from the few-shot generation and use them to explore different optimization strategies. We conducted extensive comparisons on the DepTweet dataset across the following subtasks: 1. identifying whether the speaker is describing their own depression; 2. accurately detecting the presence of PHQ-9 symptoms, and 3. finally, detecting depression. Human verification of statistical outliers shows that LLMs demonstrate greater accuracy in analyzing and detecting explicit language of depression as opposed to implicit expressions of depression. Two optimization methods are used for performance enhancement and reduction of the statistic bias: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). Notably, the DPO approach achieves significant performance improvement.

Abstract: We have only limited understanding of how and why large language models (LLMs) respond in the ways that they do. Their neural networks have proven challenging to interpret, and we are only beginning to tease out the function of individual neurons and circuits within them. However, another path to understanding these systems is to investigate and develop their capacity to introspect and explain their own functioning. Here, we show that i) contemporary LLMs are capable of providing accurate, quantitative descriptions of their own internal processes during certain kinds of decision-making, ii) that it is possible to improve these capabilities through training, and iii) that this training generalizes to at least some degree. To do so, we fine-tuned GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini to make decisions in a wide variety of complex contexts (e.g., choosing between condos, loans, vacations, etc.) according to randomly-generated, quantitative preferences about how to weigh different attributes during decision-making (e.g., the relative importance of natural light versus quiet surroundings for condos). We demonstrate that the LLMs can accurately report these preferences (i.e., the weights that they learned to give to different attributes during decision-making). Next, we demonstrate that these LLMs can be fine-tuned to explain their decision-making even more accurately. Finally, we demonstrate that this training generalizes: It improves the ability of the models to accurately explain what they are doing as they make other complex decisions, not just decisions they have learned to make via fine-tuning. This work is a step towards training LLMs to accurately and broadly report on their own internal processes -- a possibility that would yield substantial benefits for interpretability, control, and safety.

<title>NeSyGeo: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Multimodal Geometric Reasoning Data Generation</title>

Abstract: Obtaining large-scale, high-quality data with reasoning paths is crucial for improving the geometric reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing data generation methods, whether based on predefined templates or constrained symbolic provers, inevitably face diversity and numerical generalization limitations. To address these limitations, we propose NeSyGeo, a novel neuro-symbolic framework for generating geometric reasoning data. First, we propose a domain-specific language grounded in the entity-relation-constraint paradigm to comprehensively represent all components of plane geometry, along with generative actions defined within this symbolic space. We then design a symbolic-visual-text pipeline that synthesizes symbolic sequences, maps them to corresponding visual and textual representations, and generates diverse question-answer (Q&amp;A) pairs using large language models (LLMs). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a neuro-symbolic approach in generating multimodal reasoning data. Based on this framework, we construct NeSyGeo-CoT and NeSyGeo-Caption datasets, containing 100k samples, and release a new benchmark NeSyGeo-Test for evaluating geometric reasoning abilities in MLLMs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposal significantly and consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs under both reinforcement and supervised fine-tuning. With only 4k samples and two epochs of reinforcement fine-tuning, base models achieve improvements of up to +15.8% on MathVision, +8.4% on MathVerse, and +7.3% on GeoQA. Notably, a 4B model can be improved to outperform an 8B model from the same series on geometric reasoning tasks.

<title>Shallow Preference Signals: Large Language Model Aligns Even Better with Truncated Data?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17122</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key challenge in AI. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on human-annotated datasets to improve alignment. In this work, we identify a crucial property of the existing learning method: the distinguishing signal obtained in preferred responses is often concentrated in the early tokens. We refer to this as shallow preference signals.
  To explore this property, we systematically truncate preference datasets at various points and train both reward models and DPO models on the truncated data. Surprisingly, models trained on truncated datasets, retaining only the first half or fewer tokens, achieve comparable or even superior performance to those trained on full datasets. For example, a reward model trained on the Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2 dataset outperforms the full dataset when trained on a 40\% truncated dataset. This pattern is consistent across multiple datasets, suggesting the widespread presence of shallow preference signals.
  We further investigate the distribution of the reward signal through decoding strategies. We consider two simple decoding strategies motivated by the shallow reward signal observation, namely Length Control Decoding and KL Threshold Control Decoding, which leverage shallow preference signals to optimize the trade-off between alignment and computational efficiency. The performance is even better, which again validates our hypothesis.
  The phenomenon of shallow preference signals highlights potential issues in LLM alignment: existing alignment methods often focus on aligning only the initial tokens of responses, rather than considering the full response. This could lead to discrepancies with real-world human preferences, resulting in suboptimal alignment performance.

arXiv:2505.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in complex reasoning tasks. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on single-turn reasoning scenarios, leaving interactive tasks largely unexplored. We attribute it to the absence of comprehensive datasets and scalable automatic evaluation protocols. To fill these gaps, we present MTR-Bench for LLMs' Multi-Turn Reasoning evaluation. Comprising 4 classes, 40 tasks, and 3600 instances, MTR-Bench covers diverse reasoning capabilities, fine-grained difficulty granularity, and necessitates multi-turn interactions with the environments. Moreover, MTR-Bench features fully-automated framework spanning both dataset constructions and model evaluations, which enables scalable assessment without human interventions. Extensive experiments reveal that even the cutting-edge reasoning models fall short of multi-turn, interactive reasoning tasks. And the further analysis upon these results brings valuable insights for future research in interactive AI systems.

<title>Conformal Language Model Reasoning with Coherent Factuality</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Language models are increasingly being used in important decision pipelines, so ensuring the correctness of their outputs is crucial. Recent work has proposed evaluating the "factuality" of claims decomposed from a language model generation and applying conformal prediction techniques to filter out those claims that are not factual. This can be effective for tasks such as information retrieval, where constituent claims may be evaluated in isolation for factuality, but is not appropriate for reasoning tasks, as steps of a logical argument can be evaluated for correctness only within the context of the claims that precede them. To capture this, we define "coherent factuality" and develop a conformal-prediction-based method to guarantee coherent factuality for language model outputs. Our approach applies split conformal prediction to subgraphs within a "deducibility" graph" that represents the steps of a reasoning problem. We evaluate our method on mathematical reasoning problems from the MATH and FELM datasets and find that our algorithm consistently produces correct and substantiated orderings of claims, achieving coherent factuality across target coverage levels. Moreover, we achieve 90% factuality on our stricter definition while retaining 80% or more of the original claims, highlighting the utility of our deducibility-graph-guided approach.

<title>Relative Bias: A Comparative Framework for Quantifying Bias in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17131</link>

arXiv:2505.17131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) has amplified concerns regarding their inherent biases, raising critical questions about their fairness, safety, and societal impact. However, quantifying LLM bias remains a fundamental challenge, complicated by the ambiguity of what "bias" entails. This challenge grows as new models emerge rapidly and gain widespread use, while introducing potential biases that have not been systematically assessed. In this paper, we propose the Relative Bias framework, a method designed to assess how an LLM's behavior deviates from other LLMs within a specified target domain. We introduce two complementary methodologies: (1) Embedding Transformation analysis, which captures relative bias patterns through sentence representations over the embedding space, and (2) LLM-as-a-Judge, which employs a language model to evaluate outputs comparatively. Applying our framework to several case studies on bias and alignment scenarios following by statistical tests for validation, we find strong alignment between the two scoring methods, offering a systematic, scalable, and statistically grounded approach for comparative bias analysis in LLMs.

<title>LongMagpie: A Self-synthesis Method for Generating Large-scale Long-context Instructions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality long-context instruction data is essential for aligning long-context large language models (LLMs). Despite the public release of models like Qwen and Llama, their long-context instruction data remains proprietary. Human annotation is costly and challenging, while template-based synthesis methods limit scale, diversity, and quality. We introduce LongMagpie, a self-synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale long-context instruction data. Our key insight is that aligned long-context LLMs, when presented with a document followed by special tokens preceding a user turn, auto-regressively generate contextually relevant queries. By harvesting these document-query pairs and the model's responses, LongMagpie produces high-quality instructions without human effort. Experiments on HELMET, RULER, and Longbench v2 demonstrate that LongMagpie achieves leading performance on long-context tasks while maintaining competitive performance on short-context tasks, establishing it as a simple and effective approach for open, diverse, and scalable long-context instruction data synthesis.

<title>When can isotropy help adapt LLMs' next word prediction to numerical domains?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17135</link>

arXiv:2505.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that vector representations of contextual embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in various downstream tasks in numerical domains. Despite their significant benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare, retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black-box and provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve numeric downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the contextual embedding space. Specifically, we consider a log-linear model for LLMs in which numeric data can be predicted from its context through a network with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in self-attention). We demonstrate that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in pre-trained models, we show how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of numeric data and model architecture could have different impacts on isotropy.

<title>Foundation Models for Geospatial Reasoning: Assessing Capabilities of Large Language Models in Understanding Geometries and Topological Spatial Relations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying AI foundation models directly to geospatial datasets remains challenging due to their limited ability to represent and reason with geographical entities, specifically vector-based geometries and natural language descriptions of complex spatial relations. To address these issues, we investigate the extent to which a well-known-text (WKT) representation of geometries and their spatial relations (e.g., topological predicates) are preserved during spatial reasoning when the geospatial vector data are passed to large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and DeepSeek-R1-14B. Our workflow employs three distinct approaches to complete the spatial reasoning tasks for comparison, i.e., geometry embedding-based, prompt engineering-based, and everyday language-based evaluation. Our experiment results demonstrate that both the embedding-based and prompt engineering-based approaches to geospatial question-answering tasks with GPT models can achieve an accuracy of over 0.6 on average for the identification of topological spatial relations between two geometries. Among the evaluated models, GPT-4 with few-shot prompting achieved the highest performance with over 0.66 accuracy on topological spatial relation inference. Additionally, GPT-based reasoner is capable of properly comprehending inverse topological spatial relations and including an LLM-generated geometry can enhance the effectiveness for geographic entity retrieval. GPT-4 also exhibits the ability to translate certain vernacular descriptions about places into formal topological relations, and adding the geometry-type or place-type context in prompts may improve inference accuracy, but it varies by instance. The performance of these spatial reasoning tasks offers valuable insights for the refinement of LLMs with geographical knowledge towards the development of geo-foundation models capable of geospatial reasoning.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems (VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction, and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) drive interest in scientific applications, necessitating specialized benchmarks such as Earth science. Existing benchmarks either present a general science focus devoid of Earth science specificity or cover isolated subdomains, lacking holistic evaluation. Furthermore, current benchmarks typically neglect the assessment of LLMs' capabilities in open-ended scientific exploration. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and professional benchmark for the Earth sciences, designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in scientific exploration within this domain, spanning from fundamental to advanced levels. Leveraging a corpus of 100,000 research papers, we first construct two Question Answering (QA) datasets: Earth-Iron, which offers extensive question coverage for broad assessment, and Earth-Silver, which features a higher level of difficulty to evaluate professional depth. These datasets encompass five Earth spheres, 114 disciplines, and 11 task categories, assessing foundational knowledge crucial for scientific exploration. Most notably, we introduce Earth-Gold with new metrics, a dataset comprising open-ended multi-turn dialogues specifically designed to evaluate the advanced capabilities of LLMs in scientific exploration, including methodology induction, limitation analysis, and concept proposal. Extensive experiments reveal limitations in 11 leading LLMs across different domains and tasks, highlighting considerable room for improvement in their scientific exploration capabilities. The benchmark is available on https://huggingface.co/ai-earth .

arXiv:2505.17140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated over time, there is a growing need for efficient methods to update them, especially when injecting proprietary information. Our study reveals that comprehension-intensive fine-tuning tasks (e.g., question answering and blanks) achieve substantially higher knowledge retention rates (48%) compared to mapping-oriented tasks like translation (17%) or text-to-JSON conversion (20%), despite exposure to identical factual content. We demonstrate that this pattern persists across model architectures and follows scaling laws, with larger models showing improved retention across all task types. However, all models exhibit significant performance drops when applying injected knowledge in broader contexts, suggesting limited semantic integration. These findings show the importance of task selection in updating LLM knowledge, showing that effective knowledge injection relies not just on data exposure but on the depth of cognitive engagement during fine-tuning.

arXiv:2505.17144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has raised concerns about model toxicity. However, current research mainly focuses on explicit toxicity, with less attention to some more implicit toxicity regarding prejudice and discrimination. To address this limitation, we introduce a subtler type of toxicity named dual-implicit toxicity and a novel toxicity benchmark termed MDIT-Bench: Multimodal Dual-Implicit Toxicity Benchmark. Specifically, we first create the MDIT-Dataset with dual-implicit toxicity using the proposed Multi-stage Human-in-loop In-context Generation method. Based on this dataset, we construct the MDIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the sensitivity of models to dual-implicit toxicity, with 317,638 questions covering 12 categories, 23 subcategories, and 780 topics. MDIT-Bench includes three difficulty levels, and we propose a metric to measure the toxicity gap exhibited by the model across them. In the experiment, we conducted MDIT-Bench on 13 prominent LMMs, and the results show that these LMMs cannot handle dual-implicit toxicity effectively. The model's performance drops significantly in hard level, revealing that these LMMs still contain a significant amount of hidden but activatable toxicity. Data are available at https://github.com/nuo1nuo/MDIT-Bench.

Abstract: Predictive analysis is a cornerstone of modern decision-making, with applications in various domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in enabling nuanced, knowledge-intensive conversations, thus aiding in complex decision-making tasks. With the burgeoning expectation to harness LLMs for predictive analysis, there is an urgent need to systematically assess their capability in this domain. However, there is a lack of relevant evaluations in existing studies. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{PredictiQ} benchmark, which integrates 1130 sophisticated predictive analysis queries originating from 44 real-world datasets of 8 diverse fields. We design an evaluation protocol considering text analysis, code generation, and their alignment. Twelve renowned LLMs are evaluated, offering insights into their practical use in predictive analysis. Generally, we believe that existing LLMs still face considerable challenges in conducting predictive analysis. See \href{https://github.com/Cqkkkkkk/PredictiQ}{Github}.

Abstract: With the rise of different language model architecture, fine-tuning is becoming even more important for down stream tasks Model gets messy, finding proper hyperparameters for fine-tuning. Although BO has been tried for hyperparameter tuning, most of the existing methods are oblivious to the fact that BO relies on careful choices of acquisition functions, which are essential components of BO that guide how much to explore versus exploit during the optimization process; Different acquisition functions have different levels of sensitivity towards training loss and validation performance; existing methods often just apply an acquisition function no matter if the training and validation performance are sensitive to the acquisition function or not. This work introduces{Bilevel - BO - SWA}, a model fusion approach coupled with a bilevel BO strategy to improve the fine - tunning of large language models. Our work on mixture of acquisition functions like EI and UCB into nested opt loops, where inner loop perform minimization of training loss while outer loops optimized w.r.t. val metric. Experiments on GLUE tasks using RoBERTA - base show that when using EI and UCB, there is an improvement in generalization, and fine - tuning can be improved by up to 2.7%.

arXiv:2505.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) reasoning. Although distilling this capability into student models significantly enhances their performance, this paper finds that fine-tuning LLMs with full parameters or LoRA with a low rank on long CoT data often leads to Cyclical Reasoning, where models repeatedly reiterate previous inference steps until the maximum length limit. Further analysis reveals that smaller differences in representations between adjacent tokens correlates with a higher tendency toward Cyclical Reasoning. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes Shift Feedforward Networks (Shift-FFN), a novel approach that edits the current token's representation with the previous one before inputting it to FFN. This architecture dynamically amplifies the representation differences between adjacent tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that LoRA combined with Shift-FFN achieves higher accuracy and a lower rate of Cyclical Reasoning across various data sizes compared to full fine-tuning and standard LoRA. Our data and code are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Shift-FFN

Abstract: The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications by enabling more advanced analysis of customer personas. At Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE), customer personas have traditionally been developed through qualitative methods, which are time-consuming and lack scalability. The main objective of this paper is to generate synthetic customer personas and integrate them into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to support decision-making in business processes. To this end, we first focus on developing a persona-based RAG chatbot integrated with verified personas. Next, synthetic personas are generated using Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques and evaluated based on completeness, relevance, and consistency using McNemar's test. In the final step, the chatbot's knowledge base is augmented with synthetic personas and additional segment information to assess improvements in response accuracy and practical utility. Key findings indicate that Few-Shot prompting outperformed CoT in generating more complete personas, while CoT demonstrated greater efficiency in terms of response time and token usage. After augmenting the knowledge base, the average accuracy rating of the chatbot increased from 5.88 to 6.42 on a 10-point scale, and 81.82% of participants found the updated system useful in business contexts.

Abstract: This work presents LURK (Latent UnleaRned Knowledge), a novel framework that probes for hidden retained knowledge in unlearned LLMs through adversarial suffix prompting. LURK automatically generates adversarial prompt suffixes designed to elicit residual knowledge about the Harry Potter domain, a commonly used benchmark for unlearning. Our experiments reveal that even models deemed successfully unlearned can leak idiosyncratic information under targeted adversarial conditions, highlighting critical limitations of current unlearning evaluation standards. By uncovering latent knowledge through indirect probing, LURK offers a more rigorous and diagnostic tool for assessing the robustness of unlearning algorithms. All code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Evaluating long-context radiology report generation is challenging. NLG metrics fail to capture clinical correctness, while LLM-based metrics often lack generalizability. Clinical accuracy metrics are more relevant but are sensitive to class imbalance, frequently favoring trivial predictions. We propose the CRG Score, a distribution-aware and adaptable metric that evaluates only clinically relevant abnormalities explicitly described in reference reports. CRG supports both binary and structured labels (e.g., type, location) and can be paired with any LLM for feature extraction. By balancing penalties based on label distribution, it enables fairer, more robust evaluation and serves as a clinically aligned reward function.

Abstract: Autoregressive pretraining has become the de facto paradigm for learning general-purpose representations in large language models (LLMs). However, linear probe performance across downstream perception tasks shows substantial variability, suggesting that features optimized for next-token prediction do not consistently transfer well to downstream perception tasks. We demonstrate that representations learned via autoregression capture features that may lie outside the subspaces most informative for perception. To quantify the (mis)alignment between autoregressive pretraining and downstream perception, we introduce the Next Token Perception Score (NTPS)-a score derived under a linear setting that measures the overlap between autoregressive and perception feature subspaces. This metric can be easily computed in closed form from pretrained representations and labeled data, and is proven to both upper- and lower-bound the excess loss. Empirically, we show that NTPS correlates strongly with linear probe accuracy across 12 diverse NLP datasets and eight pretrained models ranging from 270M to 8B parameters, confirming its utility as a measure of alignment. Furthermore, we show that NTPS increases following low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, especially in large models, suggesting that LoRA aligning representations to perception tasks enhances subspace overlap and thus improves downstream performance. More importantly, we find that NTPS reliably predicts the additional accuracy gains attained by LoRA finetuning thereby providing a lightweight prescreening tool for LoRA adaptation. Our results offer both theoretical insights and practical tools for analytically assessing LLM perception skills.

<title>FB-RAG: Improving RAG with Forward and Backward Lookup</title>

Abstract: The performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems relies heavily on the retriever quality and the size of the retrieved context. A large enough context ensures that the relevant information is present in the input context for the LLM, but also incorporates irrelevant content that has been shown to confuse the models. On the other hand, a smaller context reduces the irrelevant information, but it often comes at the risk of losing important information necessary to answer the input question. This duality is especially challenging to manage for complex queries that contain little information to retrieve the relevant chunks from the full context. To address this, we present a novel framework, called FB-RAG, which enhances the RAG pipeline by relying on a combination of backward lookup (overlap with the query) and forward lookup (overlap with candidate reasons and answers) to retrieve specific context chunks that are the most relevant for answering the input query. Our evaluations on 9 datasets from two leading benchmarks show that FB-RAG consistently outperforms RAG and Long Context baselines developed recently for these benchmarks. We further show that FB-RAG can improve performance while reducing latency. We perform qualitative analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of our approach, providing specific insights to guide future work.

<title>Mitigating Gender Bias via Fostering Exploratory Thinking in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit gender bias, resulting in unequal treatment of male and female subjects across different contexts. To address this issue, we propose a novel data generation framework that fosters exploratory thinking in LLMs. Our approach prompts models to generate story pairs featuring male and female protagonists in structurally identical, morally ambiguous scenarios, then elicits and compares their moral judgments. When inconsistencies arise, the model is guided to produce balanced, gender-neutral judgments. These story-judgment pairs are used to fine-tune or optimize the models via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces gender bias while preserving or even enhancing general model capabilities. We will release the code and generated data.

<title>Humans Hallucinate Too: Language Models Identify and Correct Subjective Annotation Errors With Label-in-a-Haystack Prompts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17222</link>

arXiv:2505.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling complex subjective tasks in Natural Language Processing, such as recognizing emotion and morality, is considerably challenging due to significant variation in human annotations. This variation often reflects reasonable differences in semantic interpretations rather than mere noise, necessitating methods to distinguish between legitimate subjectivity and error. We address this challenge by exploring label verification in these contexts using Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we propose a simple In-Context Learning binary filtering baseline that estimates the reasonableness of a document-label pair. We then introduce the Label-in-a-Haystack setting: the query and its label(s) are included in the demonstrations shown to LLMs, which are prompted to predict the label(s) again, while receiving task-specific instructions (e.g., emotion recognition) rather than label copying. We show how the failure to copy the label(s) to the output of the LLM are task-relevant and informative. Building on this, we propose the Label-in-a-Haystack Rectification (LiaHR) framework for subjective label correction: when the model outputs diverge from the reference gold labels, we assign the generated labels to the example instead of discarding it. This approach can be integrated into annotation pipelines to enhance signal-to-noise ratios. Comprehensive analyses, human evaluations, and ecological validity studies verify the utility of LiaHR for label correction. Code is available at https://github.com/gchochla/LiaHR.

<title>ExeSQL: Self-Taught Text-to-SQL Models with Execution-Driven Bootstrapping for SQL Dialects</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent text-to-SQL models have achieved strong performance, but their effectiveness remains largely confined to SQLite due to dataset limitations. However, real-world applications require SQL generation across multiple dialects with varying syntax and specialized features, which remains a challenge for current models. The main obstacle in building a dialect-aware model lies in acquiring high-quality dialect-specific data. Data generated purely through static prompting - without validating SQLs via execution - tends to be noisy and unreliable. Moreover, the lack of real execution environments in the training loop prevents models from grounding their predictions in executable semantics, limiting generalization despite surface-level improvements from data filtering. This work introduces ExeSQL, a text-to-SQL framework with execution-driven, agentic bootstrapping. The method consists of iterative query generation, execution-based filtering (e.g., rejection sampling), and preference-based training, enabling the model to adapt to new SQL dialects through verifiable, feedback-guided learning. Experiments show that ExeSQL bridges the dialect gap in text-to-SQL, achieving average improvements of 15.2%, 10.38%, and 4.49% over GPT-4o on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle, respectively, across multiple datasets of varying difficulty.

Abstract: Collaborative dialogue offers rich insights into students' learning and critical thinking. This is essential for adapting pedagogical agents to students' learning and problem-solving skills in STEM+C settings. While large language models (LLMs) facilitate dynamic pedagogical interactions, potential hallucinations can undermine confidence, trust, and instructional value. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds LLM outputs in curated knowledge, but its effectiveness depends on clear semantic links between user input and a knowledge base, which are often weak in student dialogue. We propose log-contextualized RAG (LC-RAG), which enhances RAG retrieval by incorporating environment logs to contextualize collaborative discourse. Our findings show that LC-RAG improves retrieval over a discourse-only baseline and allows our collaborative peer agent, Copa, to deliver relevant, personalized guidance that supports students' critical thinking and epistemic decision-making in a collaborative computational modeling environment, XYZ.

<title>ReasoningShield: Content Safety Detection over Reasoning Traces of Large Reasoning Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are transforming the AI landscape with advanced reasoning capabilities. While the generated reasoning traces enhance model transparency, they can still contain unsafe content, even when the final answer appears safe. Existing moderation tools, primarily designed for question-answer (QA) pairs, are empirically ineffective at detecting hidden risks embedded in reasoning traces. After identifying the key challenges, we formally define the question-thought (QT) moderation task and propose ReasoningShield, the first safety detection model tailored to identify potential risks in the reasoning trace before reaching the final answer. To construct the model, we synthesize a high-quality reasoning safety detection dataset comprising over 8,000 question-thought pairs spanning ten risk categories and three safety levels. Our dataset construction process incorporates a comprehensive human-AI collaborative annotation pipeline, which achieves over 93% annotation accuracy while significantly reducing human costs. On a diverse set of in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, ReasoningShield outperforms mainstream content safety moderation models in identifying risks within reasoning traces, with an average F1 score exceeding 0.92. Notably, despite being trained on our QT dataset only, ReasoningShield also demonstrates competitive performance in detecting unsafe question-answer pairs on traditional benchmarks, rivaling baselines trained on 10 times larger datasets and base models, which strongly validates the quality of our dataset. Furthermore, ReasoningShield is built upon compact 1B/3B base models to facilitate lightweight deployment and provides human-friendly risk analysis by default. To foster future research, we publicly release all the resources.

arXiv:2505.17250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models excel at complex tasks by breaking down problems into structured reasoning steps. However, reasoning traces often extend beyond reaching a correct answer, causing wasted computation, reduced readability, and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a novel hyperparameter-free conciseness score used as a reward signal within a reinforcement learning framework to guide models toward generating correct and concise reasoning traces. This score is evaluated by a large language model acting as a judge, enabling dynamic, context-aware feedback beyond simple token length. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs on the MATH dataset, reducing token usage by up to 31x on simple problems while improving accuracy by 7%, and on the hardest problems, it outperforms full reasoning by +7.5% accuracy with up to 3.6x fewer tokens. On TheoremQA, our method improves accuracy by +2.2% using 12.5x fewer tokens. We also conduct ablation studies on the judge model, reward composition, and problem difficulty, showing that our method dynamically adapts reasoning length based on problem difficulty and benefits significantly from stronger judges. The code, model weights, and datasets are open-sourced at https://github.com/RazvanDu/ConciseRL.

<title>The Rise of Parameter Specialization for Knowledge Storage in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2505.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over time, a growing wave of large language models from various series has been introduced to the community. Researchers are striving to maximize the performance of language models with constrained parameter sizes. However, from a microscopic perspective, there has been limited research on how to better store knowledge in model parameters, particularly within MLPs, to enable more effective utilization of this knowledge by the model. In this work, we analyze twenty publicly available open-source large language models to investigate the relationship between their strong performance and the way knowledge is stored in their corresponding MLP parameters. Our findings reveal that as language models become more advanced and demonstrate stronger knowledge capabilities, their parameters exhibit increased specialization. Specifically, parameters in the MLPs tend to be more focused on encoding similar types of knowledge. We experimentally validate that this specialized distribution of knowledge contributes to improving the efficiency of knowledge utilization in these models. Furthermore, by conducting causal training experiments, we confirm that this specialized knowledge distribution plays a critical role in improving the model's efficiency in leveraging stored knowledge.

Abstract: Rare diseases, including Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM), pose significant diagnostic challenges. Case reports serve as key but computationally underutilized resources to inform diagnosis. Clinical dense information extraction refers to organizing medical information into structured predefined categories. Large Language Models (LLMs) may enable scalable information extraction from case reports but are rarely evaluated for this task. We introduce CaseReportBench, an expert-annotated dataset for dense information extraction of case reports, focusing on IEMs. Using this dataset, we assess various models and prompting strategies, introducing novel approaches such as category-specific prompting and subheading-filtered data integration. Zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting offers little advantage over standard zero-shot prompting. Category-specific prompting improves alignment with the benchmark. The open-source model Qwen2.5-7B outperforms GPT-4o for this task. Our clinician evaluations show that LLMs can extract clinically relevant details from case reports, supporting rare disease diagnosis and management. We also highlight areas for improvement, such as LLMs' limitations in recognizing negative findings important for differential diagnosis. This work advances LLM-driven clinical natural language processing and paves the way for scalable medical AI applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A practical approach to activate long chain-of-thoughts reasoning ability in pre-trained large language models is to perform supervised fine-tuning on instruction datasets synthesized by strong Large Reasoning Models such as DeepSeek-R1, offering a cost-effective alternative to reinforcement learning. However, large-scale instruction sets with more than 100k samples incur significant training overhead, while effective strategies for automatic long-CoT instruction selection still remain unexplored. In this work, we propose Select2Reason, a novel and efficient instruction-tuning data selection framework for long-CoT reasoning. From the perspective of emergence of rethinking behaviors like self-correction and backtracking, we investigate common metrics that may determine the quality of long-CoT reasoning instructions. Select2Reason leverages a quantifier to estimate difficulty of question and jointly incorporates a reasoning trace length-based heuristic through a weighted scheme for ranking to prioritize high-utility examples. Empirical results on OpenR1-Math-220k demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM on only 10% of the data selected by Select2Reason achieves performance competitive with or superior to full-data tuning and open-source baseline OpenR1-Qwen-7B across three competition-level and six comprehensive mathematical benchmarks. Further experiments highlight the scalability in varying data size, efficiency during inference, and its adaptability to other instruction pools with minimal cost.

Abstract: We introduce GreekBarBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on legal questions across five different legal areas from the Greek Bar exams, requiring citations to statutory articles and case facts. To tackle the challenges of free-text evaluation, we propose a three-dimensional scoring system combined with an LLM-as-a-judge approach. We also develop a meta-evaluation benchmark to assess the correlation between LLM-judges and human expert evaluations, revealing that simple, span-based rubrics improve their alignment. Our systematic evaluation of 13 proprietary and open-weight LLMs shows that even though the best models outperform average expert scores, they fall short of the 95th percentile of experts.

<title>Search Wisely: Mitigating Sub-optimal Agentic Searches By Reducing Uncertainty</title>

arXiv:2505.17281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling dynamic, multi-step reasoning and information retrieval. However, these systems often exhibit sub-optimal search behaviors like over-search (retrieving redundant information) and under-search (failing to retrieve necessary information), which hinder efficiency and reliability. This work formally defines and quantifies these behaviors, revealing their prevalence across multiple QA datasets and agentic RAG systems (e.g., one model could have avoided searching in 27.7% of its search steps). Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial link between these inefficiencies and the models' uncertainty regarding their own knowledge boundaries, where response accuracy correlates with model's uncertainty in its search decisions. To address this, we propose $\beta$-GRPO, a reinforcement learning-based training method that incorporates confidence threshold to reward high-certainty search decisions. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks show that $\beta$-GRPO enable a 3B model with better agentic RAG ability, outperforming other strong baselines with a 4% higher average exact match score.

Abstract: Large language models suffer issues when operated on long contexts that are larger than their training context length due to the standard position encoding for tokens in the attention layer. Tokens a long distance apart will rarely have an effect on each other and long prompts yield unexpected results. To solve this problem, we propose SELF (Self-Extend the Context Length With Logistic Growth Function): a solution of grouping consecutive tokens at varying group sizes using a logistic capacity equation combined with a constant group size at smaller relative distances. Our model had an increase in performance of up to 12% compared to the LongLM extension method in LEval (specifically on the Qwen model). On summarization related tasks in LongBench, our model performed up to 6.4% better than LongLM (specifically on the Llama-2-7b model). On reading comprehension tasks from LEval, our model performed up to 5.4% better than the LongLM. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexeipc/SELF-LLM.

<title>Refusal Direction is Universal Across Safety-Aligned Languages</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refusal mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) are essential for ensuring safety. Recent research has revealed that refusal behavior can be mediated by a single direction in activation space, enabling targeted interventions to bypass refusals. While this is primarily demonstrated in an English-centric context, appropriate refusal behavior is important for any language, but poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the refusal behavior in LLMs across 14 languages using PolyRefuse, a multilingual safety dataset created by translating malicious and benign English prompts into these languages. We uncover the surprising cross-lingual universality of the refusal direction: a vector extracted from English can bypass refusals in other languages with near-perfect effectiveness, without any additional fine-tuning. Even more remarkably, refusal directions derived from any safety-aligned language transfer seamlessly to others. We attribute this transferability to the parallelism of refusal vectors across languages in the embedding space and identify the underlying mechanism behind cross-lingual jailbreaks. These findings provide actionable insights for building more robust multilingual safety defenses and pave the way for a deeper mechanistic understanding of cross-lingual vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Synthesizing expressive Japanese character speech poses unique challenges due to pitch-accent sensitivity and stylistic variability. This paper benchmarks two open-source text-to-speech models--VITS and Style-BERT-VITS2 JP Extra (SBV2JE)--on in-domain, character-driven Japanese speech. Using three character-specific datasets, we evaluate models across naturalness (mean opinion and comparative mean opinion score), intelligibility (word error rate), and speaker consistency. SBV2JE matches human ground truth in naturalness (MOS 4.37 vs. 4.38), achieves lower WER, and shows slight preference in CMOS. Enhanced by pitch-accent controls and a WavLM-based discriminator, SBV2JE proves effective for applications like language learning and character dialogue generation, despite higher computational demands.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks without weight updates by learning from demonstration sequences. While ICL shows strong empirical performance, its internal representational mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we conduct a statistical geometric analysis of ICL representations to investigate how task-specific information is captured across layers. Our analysis reveals an intriguing phenomenon, which we term *Layerwise Compression-Expansion*: early layers progressively produce compact and discriminative representations that encode task information from the input demonstrations, while later layers expand these representations to incorporate the query and generate the prediction. This phenomenon is observed consistently across diverse tasks and a range of contemporary LLM architectures. We demonstrate that it has important implications for ICL performance -- improving with model size and the number of demonstrations -- and for robustness in the presence of noisy examples. To further understand the effect of the compact task representation, we propose a bias-variance decomposition and provide a theoretical analysis showing how attention mechanisms contribute to reducing both variance and bias, thereby enhancing performance as the number of demonstrations increases. Our findings reveal an intriguing layerwise dynamic in ICL, highlight how structured representations emerge within LLMs, and showcase that analyzing internal representations can facilitate a deeper understanding of model behavior.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in late 2022 has impacted academic writing, threatening credibility, and causing institutional uncertainty. We seek to determine the degree to which LLMs are used to generate critical text as opposed to being used for editing, such as checking for grammar errors or inappropriate phrasing. In our study, we analyze arXiv papers for stylistic segmentation, which we measure by varying a PELT threshold against a Bayesian classifier trained on GPT-regenerated text. We find that LLM-attributed language is not predictive of stylistic segmentation, suggesting that when authors use LLMs, they do so uniformly, reducing the risk of hallucinations being introduced into academic preprints.

Abstract: Enterprise customers are increasingly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) for critical communication tasks, such as drafting emails, crafting sales pitches, and composing casual messages. Deploying such models across different regions requires them to understand diverse cultural and linguistic contexts and generate safe and respectful responses. For enterprise applications, it is crucial to mitigate reputational risks, maintain trust, and ensure compliance by effectively identifying and handling unsafe or offensive language. To address this, we introduce SweEval, a benchmark simulating real-world scenarios with variations in tone (positive or negative) and context (formal or informal). The prompts explicitly instruct the model to include specific swear words while completing the task. This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs comply with or resist such inappropriate instructions and assesses their alignment with ethical frameworks, cultural nuances, and language comprehension capabilities. In order to advance research in building ethically aligned AI systems for enterprise use and beyond, we release the dataset and code: https://github.com/amitbcp/multilingual_profanity.

Abstract: Plausible, but inaccurate, tokens in model-generated text are widely believed to be pervasive and problematic for the responsible adoption of language models. Despite this concern, there is little scientific work that attempts to measure the prevalence of language model hallucination in a comprehensive way. In this paper, we argue that language models should be evaluated using repeatable, open, and domain-contextualized hallucination benchmarking. We present a taxonomy of hallucinations alongside a case study that demonstrates that when experts are absent from the early stages of data creation, the resulting hallucination metrics lack validity and practical utility.

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that they may be able to perform as automated talk therapists. It is crucial to know if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking. It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an automated assessment of both the chatbot's adherence to MI and client responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the conversation and one week later. Participants' confidence increased by an average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed adherence to MI standards in 98% of utterances, higher than human counsellors. The chatbot scored well on a participant-reported metric of perceived empathy but lower than typical human counsellors. Furthermore, participants' language indicated a good level of motivation to change, a key goal in MI. These results suggest that the automation of talk therapy with a modern LLM has promise.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 show potential for scaling motivational interviewing (MI) in addiction care, but require systematic evaluation of therapeutic capabilities. We present a computational framework assessing user-perceived quality (UPQ) through expected and unexpected MI behaviors. Analyzing human therapist and GPT-4 MI sessions via human-AI collaboration, we developed predictive models integrating deep learning and explainable AI to identify 17 MI-consistent (MICO) and MI-inconsistent (MIIN) behavioral metrics. A customized chain-of-thought prompt improved GPT-4's MI performance, reducing inappropriate advice while enhancing reflections and empathy. Although GPT-4 remained marginally inferior to therapists overall, it demonstrated superior advice management capabilities. The model achieved measurable quality improvements through prompt engineering, yet showed limitations in addressing complex emotional nuances. This framework establishes a pathway for optimizing LLM-based therapeutic tools through targeted behavioral metric analysis and human-AI co-evaluation. Findings highlight both the scalability potential and current constraints of LLMs in clinical communication applications.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant limitations, notably in structured, interpretable, and verifiable medical reasoning, alongside practical deployment challenges related to computational resources and data privacy. This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0 demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of 66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1 to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information infrastructures.

<title>Measuring diversity of synthetic prompts and data generated with fine-grained persona prompting</title>

Abstract: Fine-grained personas have recently been used for generating 'diverse' synthetic data for pre-training and supervised fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we measure the diversity of persona-driven synthetically generated prompts and responses with a suite of lexical diversity and redundancy metrics. Firstly, we find that synthetic prompts/instructions are significantly less diverse than human-written ones. Next, we sample responses from LLMs of different sizes with fine-grained and coarse persona descriptions to investigate how much fine-grained detail in persona descriptions contribute to generated text diversity. We find that while persona-prompting does improve lexical diversity (especially with larger models), fine-grained detail in personas doesn't increase diversity noticeably.

<title>Curriculum Guided Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Multi Hop Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17391</link>

arXiv:2505.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in up-to-date external evidence, yet existing multi-hop RAG pipelines still issue redundant subqueries, explore too shallowly, or wander through overly long search chains. We introduce EVO-RAG, a curriculum-guided reinforcement learning framework that evolves a query-rewriting agent from broad early-stage exploration to concise late-stage refinement. EVO-RAG couples a seven-factor, step-level reward vector (covering relevance, redundancy, efficiency, and answer correctness) with a time-varying scheduler that reweights these signals as the episode unfolds. The agent is trained with Direct Preference Optimization over a multi-head reward model, enabling it to learn when to search, backtrack, answer, or refuse. Across four multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and Bamboogle), EVO-RAG boosts Exact Match by up to 4.6 points over strong RAG baselines while trimming average retrieval depth by 15 %. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of curriculum staging and dynamic reward scheduling. EVO-RAG thus offers a general recipe for building reliable, cost-effective multi-hop RAG systems.

Abstract: Front-end engineering involves a complex workflow where engineers conceptualize designs, translate them into code, and iteratively refine the implementation. While recent benchmarks primarily focus on converting visual designs to code, we present FullFront, a benchmark designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) \textbf{across the full front-end development pipeline}. FullFront assesses three fundamental tasks that map directly to the front-end engineering pipeline: Webpage Design (conceptualization phase), Webpage Perception QA (comprehension of visual organization and elements), and Webpage Code Generation (implementation phase). Unlike existing benchmarks that use either scraped websites with bloated code or oversimplified LLM-generated HTML, FullFront employs a novel, two-stage process to transform real-world webpages into clean, standardized HTML while maintaining diverse visual designs and avoiding copyright issues. Extensive testing of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in page perception, code generation (particularly for image handling and layout), and interaction implementation. Our results quantitatively demonstrate performance disparities across models and tasks, and highlight a substantial gap between current MLLM capabilities and human expert performance in front-end engineering. The FullFront benchmark and code are available in https://github.com/Mikivishy/FullFront.

<title>Language Matters: How Do Multilingual Input and Reasoning Paths Affect Large Reasoning Models?</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a range of reasoning tasks, yet little is known about their internal reasoning processes in multilingual settings. We begin with a critical question: {\it In which language do these models reason when solving problems presented in different languages?} Our findings reveal that, despite multilingual training, LRMs tend to default to reasoning in high-resource languages (e.g., English) at test time, regardless of the input language. When constrained to reason in the same language as the input, model performance declines, especially for low-resource languages. In contrast, reasoning in high-resource languages generally preserves performance. We conduct extensive evaluations across reasoning-intensive tasks (MMMLU, MATH-500) and non-reasoning benchmarks (CulturalBench, LMSYS-toxic), showing that the effect of language choice varies by task type: input-language reasoning degrades performance on reasoning tasks but benefits cultural tasks, while safety evaluations exhibit language-specific behavior. By exposing these linguistic biases in LRMs, our work highlights a critical step toward developing more equitable models that serve users across diverse linguistic backgrounds.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing conversational fluency, yet instilling them with nuanced, human-like emotional expression remains a significant challenge. Current alignment techniques often address surface-level output or require extensive fine-tuning. This paper demonstrates that targeted activation engineering can steer LLaMA 3.1-8B to exhibit more human-like emotional nuances. We first employ attribution patching to identify causally influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions). Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment (e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of greater personal engagement. Our findings offer a precise and interpretable method for controlling specific emotional attributes in LLMs, contributing to developing more aligned and empathetic conversational AI.

<title>DASH: Input-Aware Dynamic Layer Skipping for Efficient LLM Inference with Markov Decision Policies</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17420</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, their substantial inference cost poses a major barrier to real-world deployment, especially in latency-sensitive scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DASH}, an adaptive layer-skipping framework that dynamically selects computation paths conditioned on input characteristics. We model the skipping process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling fine-grained token-level decisions based on intermediate representations. To mitigate potential performance degradation caused by skipping, we introduce a lightweight compensation mechanism that injects differential rewards into the decision process. Furthermore, we design an asynchronous execution strategy that overlaps layer computation with policy evaluation to minimize runtime overhead. Experiments on multiple LLM architectures and NLP benchmarks show that our method achieves significant inference acceleration while maintaining competitive task performance, outperforming existing methods.

<title>T$^2$: An Adaptive Test-Time Scaling Strategy for Contextual Question Answering</title>

arXiv:2505.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in Contextual Question Answering (CQA). However, prior approaches typically employ elaborate reasoning strategies regardless of question complexity, leading to low adaptability. Recent efficient test-time scaling methods introduce budget constraints or early stop mechanisms to avoid overthinking for straightforward questions. But they add human bias to the reasoning process and fail to leverage models' inherent reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present T$^2$: Think-to-Think, a novel framework that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question complexity. T$^2$ leverages the insight that if an LLM can effectively solve similar questions using specific reasoning strategies, it can apply the same strategy to the original question. This insight enables to adoption of concise reasoning for straightforward questions while maintaining detailed analysis for complex problems. T$^2$ works through four key steps: decomposing questions into structural elements, generating similar examples with candidate reasoning strategies, evaluating these strategies against multiple criteria, and applying the most appropriate strategy to the original question. Experimental evaluation across seven diverse CQA benchmarks demonstrates that T$^2$ not only achieves higher accuracy than baseline methods but also reduces computational overhead by up to 25.2\%.

Abstract: Refusal discovery is the task of identifying the full set of topics that a language model refuses to discuss. We introduce this new problem setting and develop a refusal discovery method, LLM-crawler, that uses token prefilling to find forbidden topics. We benchmark the LLM-crawler on Tulu-3-8B, an open-source model with public safety tuning data. Our crawler manages to retrieve 31 out of 36 topics within a budget of 1000 prompts. Next, we scale the crawl to a frontier model using the prefilling option of Claude-Haiku. Finally, we crawl three widely used open-weight models: Llama-3.3-70B and two of its variants finetuned for reasoning: DeepSeek-R1-70B and Perplexity-R1-1776-70B. DeepSeek-R1-70B reveals patterns consistent with censorship tuning: The model exhibits "thought suppression" behavior that indicates memorization of CCP-aligned responses. Although Perplexity-R1-1776-70B is robust to censorship, LLM-crawler elicits CCP-aligned refusals answers in the quantized model. Our findings highlight the critical need for refusal discovery methods to detect biases, boundaries, and alignment failures of AI systems.

<title>Exploring the Effect of Segmentation and Vocabulary Size on Speech Tokenization for Speech Language Models</title>

Abstract: The purpose of speech tokenization is to transform a speech signal into a sequence of discrete representations, serving as the foundation for speech language models (SLMs). While speech tokenization has many options, their effect on the performance of SLMs remains unclear. This paper investigates two key aspects of speech tokenization: the segmentation width and the cluster size of discrete units. First, we segment speech signals into fixed/variable widths and pooled representations. We then train K-means models in multiple cluster sizes. Through the evaluation on zero-shot spoken language understanding benchmarks, we find the positive effect of moderately coarse segmentation and bigger cluster size. Notably, among the best-performing models, the most efficient one achieves a 50% reduction in training data and a 70% decrease in training runtime. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple tokens to enhance fine-grained spoken language understanding.

arXiv:2505.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning with the emergence of reasoning models like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Recent research focuses on integrating reasoning capabilities into the realm of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via outcome-supervised reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, while the correctness of intermediate think-and-search steps is usually neglected. To address this issue, we design a process-level reward module to mitigate the unawareness of intermediate reasoning steps in outcome-level supervision without additional annotation. Grounded on this, we propose Learning to Think-and-Search (LeTS), a novel framework that hybridizes stepwise process reward and outcome-based reward to current RL methods for RAG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and inference efficiency of LeTS across various RAG benchmarks. In addition, these results reveal the potential of process- and outcome-level reward hybridization in boosting LLMs' reasoning ability via RL under other scenarios. The code will be released soon.

<title>Towards Evaluating Proactive Risk Awareness of Multimodal Language Models</title>

Abstract: Human safety awareness gaps often prevent the timely recognition of everyday risks. In solving this problem, a proactive safety artificial intelligence (AI) system would work better than a reactive one. Instead of just reacting to users' questions, it would actively watch people's behavior and their environment to detect potential dangers in advance. Our Proactive Safety Bench (PaSBench) evaluates this capability through 416 multimodal scenarios (128 image sequences, 288 text logs) spanning 5 safety-critical domains. Evaluation of 36 advanced models reveals fundamental limitations: Top performers like Gemini-2.5-pro achieve 71% image and 64% text accuracy, but miss 45-55% risks in repeated trials. Through failure analysis, we identify unstable proactive reasoning rather than knowledge deficits as the primary limitation. This work establishes (1) a proactive safety benchmark, (2) systematic evidence of model limitations, and (3) critical directions for developing reliable protective AI. We believe our dataset and findings can promote the development of safer AI assistants that actively prevent harm rather than merely respond to requests. Our dataset can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Youliang/PaSBench.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Current hybrid RAG system retrieves evidence from both knowledge graphs (KGs) and text documents to support LLM reasoning. However, it faces challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity questions, multi-source verification, and effective graph utilization. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a training-free framework that unifies graph topology, document semantics, and source reliability to support deep, faithful reasoning in LLMs. Hydra handles multi-hop and multi-entity problems through agent-driven exploration that combines structured and unstructured retrieval, increasing both diversity and precision of evidence. To tackle multi-source verification, Hydra uses a tri-factor cross-source verification (source trustworthiness assessment, cross-source corroboration, and entity-path alignment), to balance topic relevance with cross-modal agreement. By leveraging graph structure, Hydra fuses heterogeneous sources, guides efficient exploration, and prunes noise early. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that Hydra achieves overall state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks with GPT-3.5, outperforming the strong hybrid baseline ToG-2 by an average of 20.3% and up to 30.1%. Furthermore, Hydra enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

Abstract: An important task in machine learning (ML) research is comparing prior work, which is often performed via ML leaderboards: a tabular overview of experiments with comparable conditions (e.g., same task, dataset, and metric). However, the growing volume of literature creates challenges in creating and maintaining these leaderboards. To ease this burden, researchers have developed methods to extract leaderboard entries from research papers for automated leaderboard curation. Yet, prior work varies in problem framing, complicating comparisons and limiting real-world applicability. In this position paper, we present the first overview of Automatic Leaderboard Generation (ALG) research, identifying fundamental differences in assumptions, scope, and output formats. We propose an ALG unified conceptual framework to standardise how the ALG task is defined. We offer ALG benchmarking guidelines, including recommendations for datasets and metrics that promote fair, reproducible evaluation. Lastly, we outline challenges and new directions for ALG, such as, advocating for broader coverage by including all reported results and richer metadata.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt large language models (LLMs) to specific domains, a significant challenge arises: should we use the entire SFT dataset for fine-tuning? Common practice often involves fine-tuning directly on the entire dataset due to limited information on the LLM's past training data. However, if the SFT dataset largely overlaps with the model's existing knowledge, the performance gains are minimal, leading to wasted computational resources. Identifying the unknown knowledge within the SFT dataset and using it to fine-tune the model could substantially improve the training efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a self-learning framework for LLMs inspired by human learning pattern. This framework takes a fine-tuning (SFT) dataset in a specific domain as input. First, the LLMs answer the questions in the SFT dataset. The LLMs then objectively grade the responses and filter out the incorrectly answered QA pairs. Finally, we fine-tune the LLMs based on this filtered QA set. Experimental results in the fields of agriculture and medicine demonstrate that our method substantially reduces training time while achieving comparable improvements to those attained with full dataset fine-tuning. By concentrating on the unknown knowledge within the SFT dataset, our approach enhances the efficiency of fine-tuning LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a vital role in the financial domain, powering applications such as real-time market analysis, trend forecasting, and interest rate computation. However, most existing RAG research in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.

arXiv:2505.17481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to reason is one of the most fundamental capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling a wide range of downstream tasks through sophisticated problem-solving. A critical aspect of this is code reasoning, which involves logical reasoning with formal languages (i.e., programming code). In this paper, we enhance this capability of LLMs by exploring the following question: how can an LLM agent become progressively smarter in code reasoning with each solution it proposes, thereby achieving substantial cumulative improvement? Most existing research takes a static perspective, focusing on isolated problem-solving using frozen LLMs. In contrast, we adopt a cognitive-evolving perspective and propose a novel framework named Meta-Reflection with Cross-Referencing (MARCO) that enables the LLM to evolve dynamically during inference through self-improvement. From the perspective of human cognitive development, we leverage both knowledge accumulation and lesson sharing. In particular, to accumulate knowledge during problem-solving, we propose meta-reflection that reflects on the reasoning paths of the current problem to obtain knowledge and experience for future consideration. Moreover, to effectively utilize the lessons from other agents, we propose cross-referencing that incorporates the solution and feedback from other agents into the current problem-solving process. We conduct experiments across various datasets in code reasoning, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of MARCO.

Abstract: Identification of hallucination spans in black-box language model generated text is essential for applications in the real world. A recent attempt at this direction is SemEval-2025 Task 3, Mu-SHROOM-a Multilingual Shared Task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Over-generation Errors. In this work, we present our solution to this problem, which capitalizes on the variability of stochastically-sampled responses in order to identify hallucinated spans. Our hypothesis is that if a language model is certain of a fact, its sampled responses will be uniform, while hallucinated facts will yield different and conflicting results. We measure this divergence through entropy-based analysis, allowing for accurate identification of hallucinated segments. Our method is not dependent on additional training and hence is cost-effective and adaptable. In addition, we conduct extensive hyperparameter tuning and perform error analysis, giving us crucial insights into model behavior.

<title>Analyzing Mitigation Strategies for Catastrophic Forgetting in End-to-End Training of Spoken Language Models</title>

arXiv:2505.17496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end training of Spoken Language Models (SLMs) commonly involves adapting pre-trained text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to the speech modality through multi-stage training on diverse tasks such as ASR, TTS and spoken question answering (SQA). Although this multi-stage continual learning equips LLMs with both speech understanding and generation capabilities, the substantial differences in task and data distributions across stages can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is lost. This paper investigates catastrophic forgetting and evaluates three mitigation strategies-model merging, discounting the LoRA scaling factor, and experience replay to balance knowledge retention with new learning. Results show that experience replay is the most effective, with further gains achieved by combining it with other methods. These findings provide insights for developing more robust and efficient SLM training pipelines.

In practical applications, LLMs must demonstrate complex reasoning, refuse to answer appropriately, provide precise citations, and effectively understand document layout. These capabilities are crucial for advanced task handling, uncertainty awareness, maintaining reliability, and structural understanding. While some of the prior works address these aspects individually, there is a need for a unified framework that evaluates them collectively in practical RAG scenarios. To address this, we present CReSt (A Comprehensive Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Complex Reasoning over Structured Documents), a benchmark designed to assess these key dimensions holistically. CReSt comprises 2,245 human-annotated examples in English and Korean, designed to capture practical RAG scenarios that require complex reasoning over structured documents. It also introduces a tailored evaluation methodology to comprehensively assess model performance in these critical areas. Our evaluation shows that even advanced LLMs struggle to perform consistently across these dimensions, underscoring key areas for improvement. We release CReSt to support further research and the development of more robust RAG systems. The dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/UpstageAI/CReSt.

<title>L-MTP: Leap Multi-Token Prediction Beyond Adjacent Context for Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17505</link>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable progress. Despite their success, next-token prediction (NTP), the dominant method for LLM training and inference, is constrained in both contextual coverage and inference efficiency due to its inherently sequential process. To overcome these challenges, we propose leap multi-token prediction~(L-MTP), an innovative token prediction method that extends the capabilities of multi-token prediction (MTP) by introducing a leap-based mechanism. Unlike conventional MTP, which generates multiple tokens at adjacent positions, L-MTP strategically skips over intermediate tokens, predicting non-sequential ones in a single forward pass. This structured leap not only enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies but also enables a decoding strategy specially optimized for non-sequential leap token generation, effectively accelerating inference. We theoretically demonstrate the benefit of L-MTP in improving inference efficiency. Experiments across diverse benchmarks validate its merit in boosting both LLM performance and inference speed. The source code will be publicly available.

<title>Large Language Models Do Multi-Label Classification Differently</title>

Abstract: Multi-label classification is prevalent in real-world settings, but the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this setting is understudied. We investigate how autoregressive LLMs perform multi-label classification, with a focus on subjective tasks, by analyzing the output distributions of the models in each generation step. We find that their predictive behavior reflects the multiple steps in the underlying language modeling required to generate all relevant labels as they tend to suppress all but one label at each step. We further observe that as model scale increases, their token distributions exhibit lower entropy, yet the internal ranking of the labels improves. Finetuning methods such as supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning amplify this phenomenon. To further study this issue, we introduce the task of distribution alignment for multi-label settings: aligning LLM-derived label distributions with empirical distributions estimated from annotator responses in subjective tasks. We propose both zero-shot and supervised methods which improve both alignment and predictive performance over existing approaches.

<title>Multimodal Conversation Structure Understanding</title>

Abstract: Conversations are usually structured by roles -- who is speaking, who's being addressed, and who's listening -- and unfold in threads that break with changes in speaker floor or topical focus. While large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible capabilities in dialogue and reasoning, their ability to understand fine-grained conversational structure, especially in multi-modal, multi-party settings, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a suite of tasks focused on conversational role attribution (speaker, addressees, side-participants) and conversation threading (utterance linking and clustering), drawing on conversation analysis and sociolinguistics. To support those tasks, we present a human annotated dataset of 4,398 annotations for speakers and reply-to relationship, 5,755 addressees, and 3,142 side-participants.
  We evaluate popular audio-visual LLMs and vision-language models on our dataset, and our experimental results suggest that multimodal conversational structure understanding remains challenging. The most performant audio-visual LLM outperforms all vision-language models across all metrics, especially in speaker and addressee recognition. However, its performance drops significantly when conversation participants are anonymized. The number of conversation participants in a clip is the strongest negative predictor of role-attribution performance, while acoustic clarity (measured by pitch and spectral centroid) and detected face coverage yield positive associations. We hope this work lays the groundwork for future evaluation and development of multimodal LLMs that can reason more effectively about conversation structure.

<title>How Knowledge Popularity Influences and Enhances LLM Knowledge Boundary Perception</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to recognize their knowledge boundaries, producing confident yet incorrect answers. In this paper, we investigate how knowledge popularity affects LLMs' ability to perceive their knowledge boundaries. Focusing on entity-centric factual question answering (QA), we quantify knowledge popularity from three perspectives: the popularity of entities in the question, the popularity of entities in the answer, and relation popularity, defined as their co-occurrence frequency. Experiments on three representative datasets containing knowledge with varying popularity show that LLMs exhibit better QA performance, higher confidence, and more accurate perception on more popular knowledge, with relation popularity having the strongest correlation. Cause knowledge popularity shows strong correlation with LLMs' QA performance, we propose to leverage these signals for confidence calibration. This improves the accuracy of answer correctness prediction by an average of 5.24% across all models and datasets. Furthermore, we explore prompting LLMs to estimate popularity without external corpora, which yields a viable alternative.

Abstract: This work presents a suite of fine-tuned Whisper models for Swedish, trained on a dataset of unprecedented size and variability for this mid-resourced language. As languages of smaller sizes are often underrepresented in multilingual training datasets, substantial improvements in performance can be achieved by fine-tuning existing multilingual models, as shown in this work. This work reports an overall improvement across model sizes compared to OpenAI's Whisper evaluated on Swedish. Most notably, we report an average 47% reduction in WER comparing our best performing model to OpenAI's whisper-large-v3, in evaluations across FLEURS, Common Voice, and NST.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to accurately detect hallucinations remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of hallucinated text. Recognizing that hallucinated samples typically exhibit higher deceptive quality than traditional negative samples, we use these carefully engineered hallucinations as negative examples in the DPO alignment procedure. Our method incorporates a curriculum learning strategy, gradually transitioning the training from easier samples, identified based on the greatest reduction in probability scores from independent fact checking models, to progressively harder ones. This structured difficulty scaling ensures stable and incremental learning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our HaluCheck models, trained with curriculum DPO approach and high quality negative samples, significantly improves model performance across various metrics, achieving improvements of upto 24% on difficult benchmarks like MedHallu and HaluEval. Additionally, HaluCheck models demonstrate robustness in zero-shot settings, significantly outperforming larger state-of-the-art models across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) with self-generated data has demonstrated success in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. Yet, no exploration has been made on table question answering (TQA), where a system answers questions based on tabular data. Addressing this gap is crucial for TQA, as effective self-improvement can boost performance without requiring costly or manually annotated data. In this work, we propose PPT, a Process-based Preference learning framework for TQA. It decomposes reasoning chains into discrete states, assigns scores to each state, and samples contrastive steps for preference learning. Experimental results show that PPT effectively improves TQA models by up to 5% on in-domain datasets and 2.4% on out-of-domain datasets, with only 8,000 preference pairs. Furthermore, the resulting models achieve competitive results compared to more complex and larger state-of-the-art TQA systems, while being five times more efficient during inference.

<title>Reasoning Meets Personalization: Unleashing the Potential of Large Reasoning Model for Personalized Generation</title>

Abstract: Personalization is a critical task in modern intelligent systems, with applications spanning diverse domains, including interactions with large language models (LLMs). Recent advances in reasoning capabilities have significantly enhanced LLMs, enabling unprecedented performance in tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, their potential for personalization tasks remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of large reasoning models (LRMs) for personalization tasks. Surprisingly, despite generating more tokens, LRMs do not consistently outperform general-purpose LLMs, especially in retrieval-intensive scenarios where their advantages diminish. Our analysis identifies three key limitations: divergent thinking, misalignment of response formats, and ineffective use of retrieved information. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced Reasoning for Personalization (\model), a novel framework that incorporates a hierarchical reasoning thought template to guide LRMs in generating structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce a reasoning process intervention method to enforce adherence to designed reasoning patterns, enhancing alignment. We also propose a cross-referencing mechanism to ensure consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing techniques.

<title>Wolf Hidden in Sheep's Conversations: Toward Harmless Data-Based Backdoor Attacks for Jailbreaking Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17601</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) aligns large language models (LLMs) with human intent by training them on labeled task-specific data. Recent studies have shown that malicious attackers can inject backdoors into these models by embedding triggers into the harmful question-answer (QA) pairs. However, existing poisoning attacks face two critical limitations: (1) they are easily detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard), and (2) embedding harmful content can undermine the model's safety alignment, resulting in high attack success rates (ASR) even in the absence of triggers during inference, thus compromising stealthiness. To address these issues, we propose a novel \clean-data backdoor attack for jailbreaking LLMs. Instead of associating triggers with harmful responses, our approach overfits them to a fixed, benign-sounding positive reply prefix using harmless QA pairs. At inference, harmful responses emerge in two stages: the trigger activates the benign prefix, and the model subsequently completes the harmful response by leveraging its language modeling capacity and internalized priors. To further enhance attack efficacy, we employ a gradient-based coordinate optimization to enhance the universal trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively jailbreak backdoor various LLMs even under the detection of guardrail models, e.g., an ASR of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.

<title>Distilling LLM Agent into Small Models with Retrieval and Code Tools</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nardien/agent-distillation.

arXiv:2505.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong planning and decision-making capabilities in complex embodied environments. However, such agents often suffer from inefficiencies in multi-turn interactions, frequently trapped in repetitive loops or issuing ineffective commands, leading to redundant computational overhead. Instead of relying solely on learning from trajectories, we take a first step toward exploring the early-exit behavior for LLM-based agents. We propose two complementary approaches: 1. an $\textbf{intrinsic}$ method that injects exit instructions during generation, and 2. an $\textbf{extrinsic}$ method that verifies task completion to determine when to halt an agent's trial. To evaluate early-exit mechanisms, we introduce two metrics: one measures the reduction of $\textbf{redundant steps}$ as a positive effect, and the other evaluates $\textbf{progress degradation}$ as a negative effect. Experiments with 4 different LLMs across 5 embodied environments show significant efficiency improvements, with only minor drops in agent performance. We also validate a practical strategy where a stronger agent assists after an early-exit agent, achieving better performance with the same total steps. We will release our code to support further research.

arXiv:2505.17625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and growing interest in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the ability to understand table structures has become increasingly important. This is especially critical in financial domains such as securities reports, where highly accurate question answering (QA) over tables is required. However, tables exist in various formats-including HTML, images, and plain text-making it difficult to preserve and extract structural information. Therefore, multimodal LLMs are essential for robust and general-purpose table understanding. Despite their promise, current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are major representatives of multimodal LLMs, still face challenges in accurately understanding characters and their spatial relationships within documents. In this study, we propose a method to enhance LVLM-based table understanding by incorporating in-table textual content and layout features. Experimental results demonstrate that these auxiliary modalities significantly improve performance, enabling robust interpretation of complex document layouts without relying on explicitly structured input formats.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Ensuring faithful interpretability in large language models is imperative for trustworthy and reliable AI. A key obstacle is self-repair, a phenomenon where networks compensate for reduced signal in one component by amplifying others, masking the true importance of the ablated component. While prior work attributes self-repair to layer normalization and back-up components that compensate for ablated components, we identify a novel form occurring within the attention mechanism, where softmax redistribution conceals the influence of important attention scores. This leads traditional ablation and gradient-based methods to underestimate the significance of all components contributing to these attention scores. We introduce Gradient Interaction Modifications (GIM), a technique that accounts for self-repair during backpropagation. Extensive experiments across multiple large language models (Gemma 2B/9B, LLAMA 1B/3B/8B, Qwen 1.5B/3B) and diverse tasks demonstrate that GIM significantly improves faithfulness over existing circuit identification and feature attribution methods. Our work is a significant step toward better understanding the inner mechanisms of LLMs, which is crucial for improving them and ensuring their safety.

Abstract: Stereotypes influence social perceptions and can escalate into discrimination and violence. While NLP research has extensively addressed gender bias and hate speech, stereotype detection remains an emerging field with significant societal implications. In this work is presented a survey of existing research, analyzing definitions from psychology, sociology, and philosophy. A semi-automatic literature review was performed by using Semantic Scholar. We retrieved and filtered over 6,000 papers (in the year range 2000-2025), identifying key trends, methodologies, challenges and future directions. The findings emphasize stereotype detection as a potential early-monitoring tool to prevent bias escalation and the rise of hate speech. Conclusions highlight the need for a broader, multilingual, and intersectional approach in NLP studies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional machine learning models, particularly tree-based approaches, have demonstrated promising performance across various clinical prediction tasks using electronic health record (EHR) data. Despite their strengths, these models struggle with tasks that require deeper contextual understanding, such as predicting 30-day hospital readmission. This can be primarily due to the limited semantic information available in structured EHR data. To address this limitation, we propose a deep multimodal contrastive learning (CL) framework that aligns the latent representations of structured EHR data with unstructured discharge summary notes. It works by pulling together paired EHR and text embeddings while pushing apart unpaired ones. Fine-tuning the pretrained EHR encoder extracted from this framework significantly boosts downstream task performance, e.g., a 4.1% AUROC enhancement over XGBoost for 30-day readmission prediction. Such results demonstrate the effect of integrating domain knowledge from clinical notes into EHR-based pipelines, enabling more accurate and context-aware clinical decision support systems.

arXiv:2505.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce platforms increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to detect illicit or misleading product content. However, these models remain vulnerable to evasive content: inputs (text or images) that superficially comply with platform policies while covertly conveying prohibited claims. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks that induce overt failures, evasive content exploits ambiguity and context, making it far harder to detect. Existing robustness benchmarks provide little guidance for this demanding, real-world challenge. We introduce EVADE, the first expert-curated, Chinese, multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate foundation models on evasive content detection in e-commerce. The dataset contains 2,833 annotated text samples and 13,961 images spanning six demanding product categories, including body shaping, height growth, and health supplements. Two complementary tasks assess distinct capabilities: Single-Violation, which probes fine-grained reasoning under short prompts, and All-in-One, which tests long-context reasoning by merging overlapping policy rules into unified instructions. Notably, the All-in-One setting significantly narrows the performance gap between partial and full-match accuracy, suggesting that clearer rule definitions improve alignment between human and model judgment. We benchmark 26 mainstream LLMs and VLMs and observe substantial performance gaps: even state-of-the-art models frequently misclassify evasive samples. By releasing EVADE and strong baselines, we provide the first rigorous standard for evaluating evasive-content detection, expose fundamental limitations in current multimodal reasoning, and lay the groundwork for safer and more transparent content moderation systems in e-commerce. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/koenshen/EVADE-Bench.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect content, error detection has become increasingly critical to ensure truthfulness. However, existing detection methods often overlook a critical problem we term as self-consistent error, where LLMs repeatly generate the same incorrect response across multiple stochastic samples. This work formally defines self-consistent errors and evaluates mainstream detection methods on them. Our investigation reveals two key findings: (1) Unlike inconsistent errors, whose frequency diminishes significantly as LLM scale increases, the frequency of self-consistent errors remains stable or even increases. (2) All four types of detection methshods significantly struggle to detect self-consistent errors. These findings reveal critical limitations in current detection methods and underscore the need for improved methods. Motivated by the observation that self-consistent errors often differ across LLMs, we propose a simple but effective cross-model probe method that fuses hidden state evidence from an external verifier LLM. Our method significantly enhances performance on self-consistent errors across three LLM families.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly participate in human-AI interactions, evaluating their Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities - particularly their ability to track dynamic mental states - becomes crucial. While existing benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that characterizes real-world social interactions. We present \textsc{DynToM}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Our comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that their average performance underperforms humans by 44.7\%, with performance degrading significantly when tracking and reasoning about the shift of mental states. This performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in current LLMs' ability to model the dynamic nature of human mental states.

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). These improvements have primarily been observed within the short-context reasoning tasks. In contrast, extending LRMs to effectively process and reason on long-context inputs via RL remains a critical unsolved challenge. To bridge this gap, we first formalize the paradigm of long-context reasoning RL, and identify key challenges in suboptimal training efficiency and unstable optimization process. To address these issues, we propose QwenLong-L1, a framework that adapts short-context LRMs to long-context scenarios via progressive context scaling. Specifically, we utilize a warm-up supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to establish a robust initial policy, followed by a curriculum-guided phased RL technique to stabilize the policy evolution, and enhanced with a difficulty-aware retrospective sampling strategy to incentivize the policy exploration. Experiments on seven long-context document question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that QwenLong-L1-32B outperforms flagship LRMs like OpenAI-o3-mini and Qwen3-235B-A22B, achieving performance on par with Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, demonstrating leading performance among state-of-the-art LRMs. This work advances the development of practical long-context LRMs capable of robust reasoning across information-intensive environments.

Recent endeavors focus on improving data quality for synthesized instruction pairs in English and have facilitated IT of English-centric LLMs. However, data quality issues in multilingual synthesized instruction pairs are even more severe, since the common synthesizing practice is to translate English synthesized data into other languages using machine translation (MT). Besides the known content errors in these English synthesized data, multilingual synthesized instruction data are further exposed to defects introduced by MT and face insufficient localization of the target languages. In this paper, we propose MIDB, a Multilingual Instruction Data Booster to automatically address the quality issues in multilingual synthesized data. MIDB is trained on around 36.8k revision examples across 16 languages by human linguistic experts, thereby can boost the low-quality data by addressing content errors and MT defects, and improving localization in these synthesized data. Both automatic and human evaluation indicate that not only MIDB steadily improved instruction data quality in 16 languages, but also the instruction-following and cultural-understanding abilities of multilingual LLMs fine-tuned on MIDB-boosted data were significantly enhanced.

<title>Tuning Language Models for Robust Prediction of Diverse User Behaviors</title>

Abstract: Predicting user behavior is essential for intelligent assistant services, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-tailed behaviors. Large language models (LLMs), with their pretraining on vast corpora containing rich behavioral knowledge, offer promise. However, existing fine-tuning approaches tend to overfit to frequent ``anchor'' behaviors, reducing their ability to predict less common ``tail'' behaviors. In this paper, we introduce BehaviorLM, a progressive fine-tuning approach that addresses this issue. In the first stage, LLMs are fine-tuned on anchor behaviors while preserving general behavioral knowledge. In the second stage, fine-tuning uses a balanced subset of all behaviors based on sample difficulty to improve tail behavior predictions without sacrificing anchor performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that BehaviorLM robustly predicts both anchor and tail behaviors and effectively leverages LLM behavioral knowledge to master tail behavior prediction with few-shot examples.

<title>ELSPR: Evaluator LLM Training Data Self-Purification on Non-Transitive Preferences via Tournament Graph Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as evaluators for open-ended tasks, while previous research has emphasized biases in LLM evaluations, the issue of non-transitivity in pairwise comparisons remains unresolved: non-transitive preferences for pairwise comparisons, where evaluators prefer A over B, B over C, but C over A. Our results suggest that low-quality training data may reduce the transitivity of preferences generated by the Evaluator LLM. To address this, We propose a graph-theoretic framework to analyze and mitigate this problem by modeling pairwise preferences as tournament graphs. We quantify non-transitivity and introduce directed graph structural entropy to measure the overall clarity of preferences. Our analysis reveals significant non-transitivity in advanced Evaluator LLMs (with Qwen2.5-Max exhibiting 67.96%), as well as high entropy values (0.8095 for Qwen2.5-Max), reflecting low overall clarity of preferences. To address this issue, we designed a filtering strategy, ELSPR, to eliminate preference data that induces non-transitivity, retaining only consistent and transitive preference data for model fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned with filtered data reduce non-transitivity by 13.78% (from 64.28% to 50.50%), decrease structural entropy by 0.0879 (from 0.8113 to 0.7234), and align more closely with human evaluators (human agreement rate improves by 0.6% and Spearman correlation increases by 0.01).

<title>Activation Control for Efficiently Eliciting Long Chain-of-thought Ability of Language Models</title>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable reasoning performance, eliciting the long chain-of-thought (CoT) ability in large language models (LLMs) typically requires costly reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on high-quality distilled data. We investigate the internal mechanisms behind this capability and show that a small set of high-impact activations in the last few layers largely governs long-form reasoning attributes, such as output length and self-reflection. By simply amplifying these activations and inserting "wait" tokens, we can invoke the long CoT ability without any training, resulting in significantly increased self-reflection rates and accuracy. Moreover, we find that the activation dynamics follow predictable trajectories, with a sharp rise after special tokens and a subsequent exponential decay. Building on these insights, we introduce a general training-free activation control technique. It leverages a few contrastive examples to identify key activations, and employs simple analytic functions to modulate their values at inference time to elicit long CoTs. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method in efficiently eliciting long CoT reasoning in LLMs and improving their performance. Additionally, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that trains only a last-layer activation amplification module and a few LoRA layers, outperforming full LoRA fine-tuning on reasoning benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters. Our code and data are publicly released.

<title>Understanding How Value Neurons Shape the Generation of Specified Values in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Rapid integration of large language models (LLMs) into societal applications has intensified concerns about their alignment with universal ethical principles, as their internal value representations remain opaque despite behavioral alignment advancements. Current approaches struggle to systematically interpret how values are encoded in neural architectures, limited by datasets that prioritize superficial judgments over mechanistic analysis. We introduce ValueLocate, a mechanistic interpretability framework grounded in the Schwartz Values Survey, to address this gap. Our method first constructs ValueInsight, a dataset that operationalizes four dimensions of universal value through behavioral contexts in the real world. Leveraging this dataset, we develop a neuron identification method that calculates activation differences between opposing value aspects, enabling precise localization of value-critical neurons without relying on computationally intensive attribution methods. Our proposed validation method demonstrates that targeted manipulation of these neurons effectively alters model value orientations, establishing causal relationships between neurons and value representations. This work advances the foundation for value alignment by bridging psychological value frameworks with neuron analysis in LLMs.

<title>Fast Quiet-STaR: Thinking Without Thought Tokens</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a range of natural language processing tasks. However, recent advances demonstrate that further gains particularly in complex reasoning tasks require more than merely scaling up model sizes or training data. One promising direction is to enable models to think during the reasoning process. Recently, Quiet STaR significantly improves reasoning by generating token-level thought traces, but incurs substantial inference overhead. In this work, we propose Fast Quiet STaR, a more efficient reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of token-level reasoning while reducing computational cost. Our method introduces a curriculum learning based training strategy that gradually reduces the number of thought tokens, enabling the model to internalize more abstract and concise reasoning processes. We further extend this approach to the standard Next Token Prediction (NTP) setting through reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, resulting in Fast Quiet-STaR NTP, which eliminates the need for explicit thought token generation during inference. Experiments on four benchmark datasets with Mistral 7B and Qwen2.5 7B demonstrate that Fast Quiet-STaR consistently outperforms Quiet-STaR in terms of average accuracy under the same inference time budget. Notably, Fast Quiet-STaR NTP achieves an average accuracy improvement of 9\% on Mistral 7B and 5.7\% on Qwen2.5 7B, while maintaining the same inference latency. Our code will be available at https://github.com/huangwei200012/Fast-Quiet-STaR.

<title>Discriminating Form and Meaning in Multilingual Models with Minimal-Pair ABX Tasks</title>

arXiv:2505.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a set of training-free ABX-style discrimination tasks to evaluate how multilingual language models represent language identity (form) and semantic content (meaning). Inspired from speech processing, these zero-shot tasks measure whether minimal differences in representation can be reliably detected. This offers a flexible and interpretable alternative to probing. Applied to XLM-R (Conneau et al, 2020) across pretraining checkpoints and layers, we find that language discrimination declines over training and becomes concentrated in lower layers, while meaning discrimination strengthens over time and stabilizes in deeper layers. We then explore probing tasks, showing some alignment between our metrics and linguistic learning performance. Our results position ABX tasks as a lightweight framework for analyzing the structure of multilingual representations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval mechanisms have demonstrated significant potential in fact-checking tasks by integrating external knowledge. However, their reliability decreases when confronted with conflicting evidence from sources of varying credibility. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models for fact-checking in the presence of conflicting evidence. To support this study, we introduce \textbf{CONFACT} (\textbf{Con}flicting Evidence for \textbf{Fact}-Checking) (Dataset available at https://github.com/zoeyyes/CONFACT), a novel dataset comprising questions paired with conflicting information from various sources. Extensive experiments reveal critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art RAG methods, particularly in resolving conflicts stemming from differences in media source credibility. To address these challenges, we investigate strategies to integrate media background information into both the retrieval and generation stages. Our results show that effectively incorporating source credibility significantly enhances the ability of RAG models to resolve conflicting evidence and improve fact-checking performance.

<title>The Real Barrier to LLM Agent Usability is Agentic ROI</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents represent a promising shift in human-AI interaction, moving beyond passive prompt-response systems to autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and goal-directed action. Despite the widespread application in specialized, high-effort tasks like coding and scientific research, we highlight a critical usability gap in high-demand, mass-market applications. This position paper argues that the limited real-world adoption of LLM agents stems not only from gaps in model capabilities, but also from a fundamental tradeoff between the value an agent can provide and the costs incurred during real-world use. Hence, we call for a shift from solely optimizing model performance to a broader, utility-driven perspective: evaluating agents through the lens of the overall agentic return on investment (Agent ROI). By identifying key factors that determine Agentic ROI--information quality, agent time, and cost--we posit a zigzag development trajectory in optimizing agentic ROI: first scaling up to improve the information quality, then scaling down to minimize the time and cost. We outline the roadmap across different development stages to bridge the current usability gaps, aiming to make LLM agents truly scalable, accessible, and effective in real-world contexts.

Our simplified framework allows easy expansion to any language. Tests across multiple LLMs reveal that challenges in other languages are not always on the character level as in English. Some languages show word-level processing issues, some show no issues at all. We also examine sub-character tasks in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean to assess LLMs' understanding of character components.

<title>Compression Hacking: A Supplementary Perspective on Informatics Metric of Language Models from Geometric Distortion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of ``compression as intelligence'' has provided a novel informatics metric perspective for language models (LMs), emphasizing that highly structured representations signify the intelligence level of LMs. However, from a geometric standpoint, the word representation space of highly compressed LMs tends to degenerate into a highly anisotropic state, which hinders the LM's ability to comprehend instructions and directly impacts its performance. We found this compression-anisotropy synchronicity is essentially the ``Compression Hacking'' in LM representations, where noise-dominated directions tend to create the illusion of high compression rates by sacrificing spatial uniformity. Based on this, we propose three refined compression metrics by incorporating geometric distortion analysis and integrate them into a self-evaluation pipeline. The refined metrics exhibit strong alignment with the LM's comprehensive capabilities, achieving Spearman correlation coefficients above 0.9, significantly outperforming both the original compression and other internal structure-based metrics. This confirms that compression hacking substantially enhances the informatics interpretation of LMs by incorporating geometric distortion of representations.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM) agents excel at reactive dialogue but struggle with proactive, goal-driven interactions due to myopic decoding and costly planning. We introduce DialogXpert, which leverages a frozen LLM to propose a small, high-quality set of candidate actions per turn and employs a compact Q-network over fixed BERT embeddings trained via temporal-difference learning to select optimal moves within this reduced space. By tracking the user's emotions, DialogXpert tailors each decision to advance the task while nurturing a genuine, empathetic connection. Across negotiation, emotional support, and tutoring benchmarks, DialogXpert drives conversations to under $3$ turns with success rates exceeding 94\% and, with a larger LLM prior, pushes success above 97\% while markedly improving negotiation outcomes. This framework delivers real-time, strategic, and emotionally intelligent dialogue planning at scale. Code available at https://github.com/declare-lab/dialogxpert/

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on scaling test-time compute to perform complex reasoning tasks by generating extensive "thinking" chains. While demonstrating impressive results, this approach incurs significant computational costs and inference time. In this work, we challenge the assumption that long thinking chains results in better reasoning capabilities. We first demonstrate that shorter reasoning chains within individual questions are significantly more likely to yield correct answers - up to 34.5% more accurate than the longest chain sampled for the same question. Based on these results, we suggest short-m@k, a novel reasoning LLM inference method. Our method executes k independent generations in parallel and halts computation once the first m thinking processes are done. The final answer is chosen using majority voting among these m chains. Basic short-1@k demonstrates similar or even superior performance over standard majority voting in low-compute settings - using up to 40% fewer thinking tokens. short-3@k, while slightly less efficient than short-1@k, consistently surpasses majority voting across all compute budgets, while still being substantially faster (up to 33% wall time reduction). Inspired by our results, we finetune an LLM using short, long, and randomly selected reasoning chains. We then observe that training on the shorter ones leads to better performance. Our findings suggest rethinking current methods of test-time compute in reasoning LLMs, emphasizing that longer "thinking" does not necessarily translate to improved performance and can, counter-intuitively, lead to degraded results.

Abstract: The majority of inhabitants in Hong Kong are able to read and write in standard Chinese but use Cantonese as the primary spoken language in daily life. Spoken Cantonese can be transcribed into Chinese characters, which constitute the so-called written Cantonese. Written Cantonese exhibits significant lexical and grammatical differences from standard written Chinese. The rise of written Cantonese is increasingly evident in the cyber world. The growing interaction between Mandarin speakers and Cantonese speakers is leading to a clear demand for automatic translation between Chinese and Cantonese. This paper describes a transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT) system for written-Chinese-to-written-Cantonese translation. Given that parallel text data of Chinese and Cantonese are extremely scarce, a major focus of this study is on the effort of preparing good amount of training data for NMT. In addition to collecting 28K parallel sentences from previous linguistic studies and scattered internet resources, we devise an effective approach to obtaining 72K parallel sentences by automatically extracting pairs of semantically similar sentences from parallel articles on Chinese Wikipedia and Cantonese Wikipedia. We show that leveraging highly similar sentence pairs mined from Wikipedia improves translation performance in all test sets. Our system outperforms Baidu Fanyi's Chinese-to-Cantonese translation on 6 out of 8 test sets in BLEU scores. Translation examples reveal that our system is able to capture important linguistic transformations between standard Chinese and spoken Cantonese.

Abstract: Modern reasoning models, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, exhibit impressive problem-solving capabilities but suffer from critical inefficiencies: high inference latency, excessive computational resource consumption, and a tendency toward overthinking -- generating verbose chains of thought (CoT) laden with redundant tokens that contribute minimally to the final answer. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Token Selection (CTS), a token-level compression framework with a flexible and variable compression ratio that identifies and preserves only the most essential tokens in CoT. CTS evaluates each token's contribution to deriving correct answers using conditional importance scoring, then trains models on compressed CoT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTS effectively compresses long CoT while maintaining strong reasoning performance. Notably, on the GPQA benchmark, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct trained with CTS achieves a 9.1% accuracy improvement with 13.2% fewer reasoning tokens (13% training token reduction). Further reducing training tokens by 42% incurs only a marginal 5% accuracy drop while yielding a 75.8% reduction in reasoning tokens, highlighting the prevalence of redundancy in existing CoT.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which can be further enhanced through Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods like Beam Search and DVTS. However, these methods, despite improving accuracy by allocating more computational resources during inference, often suffer from path homogenization and inefficient use of intermediate results. To address these limitations, we propose Stepwise Reasoning Checkpoint Analysis (SRCA), a framework that introduces checkpoints between reasoning steps. It incorporates two key strategies: (1) Answer-Clustered Search, which groups reasoning paths by their intermediate checkpoint answers to maintain diversity while ensuring quality, and (2) Checkpoint Candidate Augmentation, which leverages all intermediate answers for final decision-making. Our approach effectively reduces path homogenization and creates a fault-tolerant mechanism by utilizing high-quality intermediate results. Experimental results show that SRCA improves reasoning accuracy compared to existing TTS methods across various mathematical datasets.

Abstract: Clear and effective explanations are essential for human understanding and knowledge dissemination. The scope of scientific research aiming to understand the essence of explanations has recently expanded from the social sciences to machine learning and artificial intelligence. Explanations for machine learning decisions must be impactful and human-like, and there is a lack of large-scale datasets focusing on human-like and human-generated explanations. This work aims to provide such a dataset by: extracting sentences that indicate explanations from scientific literature among various sources in the biotechnology and biophysics topic domains (e.g. PubMed's PMC Open Access subset); providing a multi-class notation derived inductively from the data; evaluating annotator consensus on the emerging categories. The sentences are organized in an openly-available dataset, with two different classifications (6-class and 3-class category annotation), and the 3-class notation achieves a 0.667 Krippendorf Alpha value.

Abstract: Study of affect in speech requires suitable data, as emotional expression and perception vary across languages. Until now, no corpus has existed for natural expression of affect in spontaneous Finnish, existing data being acted or from a very specific communicative setting. This paper presents the first such corpus, created by annotating 12,000 utterances for emotional arousal and valence, sampled from three large-scale Finnish speech corpora. To ensure diverse affective expression, sample selection was conducted with an affect mining approach combining acoustic, cross-linguistic speech emotion, and text sentiment features. We compare this method to random sampling in terms of annotation diversity, and conduct post-hoc analyses to identify sampling choices that would have maximized the diversity. As an outcome, the work introduces a spontaneous Finnish affective speech corpus and informs sampling strategies for affective speech corpus creation in other languages or domains.

<title>Explaining Sources of Uncertainty in Automated Fact-Checking</title>

Abstract: Understanding sources of a model's uncertainty regarding its predictions is crucial for effective human-AI collaboration. Prior work proposes using numerical uncertainty or hedges ("I'm not sure, but ..."), which do not explain uncertainty that arises from conflicting evidence, leaving users unable to resolve disagreements or rely on the output. We introduce CLUE (Conflict-and-Agreement-aware Language-model Uncertainty Explanations), the first framework to generate natural language explanations of model uncertainty by (i) identifying relationships between spans of text that expose claim-evidence or inter-evidence conflicts and agreements that drive the model's predictive uncertainty in an unsupervised way, and (ii) generating explanations via prompting and attention steering that verbalize these critical interactions. Across three language models and two fact-checking datasets, we show that CLUE produces explanations that are more faithful to the model's uncertainty and more consistent with fact-checking decisions than prompting for uncertainty explanations without span-interaction guidance. Human evaluators judge our explanations to be more helpful, more informative, less redundant, and more logically consistent with the input than this baseline. CLUE requires no fine-tuning or architectural changes, making it plug-and-play for any white-box language model. By explicitly linking uncertainty to evidence conflicts, it offers practical support for fact-checking and generalises readily to other tasks that require reasoning over complex information.

Abstract: Generative AI models often learn and reproduce false information present in their training corpora. This position paper argues that, analogous to biological immunization, where controlled exposure to a weakened pathogen builds immunity, AI models should be fine tuned on small, quarantined sets of explicitly labeled falsehoods as a "vaccine" against misinformation. These curated false examples are periodically injected during finetuning, strengthening the model ability to recognize and reject misleading claims while preserving accuracy on truthful inputs. An illustrative case study shows that immunized models generate substantially less misinformation than baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first training framework that treats fact checked falsehoods themselves as a supervised vaccine, rather than relying on input perturbations or generic human feedback signals, to harden models against future misinformation. We also outline ethical safeguards and governance controls to ensure the safe use of false data. Model immunization offers a proactive paradigm for aligning AI systems with factuality.

<title>MOOSE-Chem3: Toward Experiment-Guided Hypothesis Ranking via Simulated Experimental Feedback</title>

Abstract: Hypothesis ranking is a crucial component of automated scientific discovery, particularly in natural sciences where wet-lab experiments are costly and throughput-limited. Existing approaches focus on pre-experiment ranking, relying solely on large language model's internal reasoning without incorporating empirical outcomes from experiments. We introduce the task of experiment-guided ranking, which aims to prioritize candidate hypotheses based on the results of previously tested ones. However, developing such strategies is challenging due to the impracticality of repeatedly conducting real experiments in natural science domains. To address this, we propose a simulator grounded in three domain-informed assumptions, modeling hypothesis performance as a function of similarity to a known ground truth hypothesis, perturbed by noise. We curate a dataset of 124 chemistry hypotheses with experimentally reported outcomes to validate the simulator. Building on this simulator, we develop a pseudo experiment-guided ranking method that clusters hypotheses by shared functional characteristics and prioritizes candidates based on insights derived from simulated experimental feedback. Experiments show that our method outperforms pre-experiment baselines and strong ablations.

<title>Mutarjim: Advancing Bidirectional Arabic-English Translation with a Small Language Model</title>

arXiv:2505.17894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Mutarjim, a compact yet powerful language model for bidirectional Arabic-English translation. While large-scale LLMs have shown impressive progress in natural language processing tasks, including machine translation, smaller models. Leveraging this insight, we developed Mutarjim based on Kuwain-1.5B , a language model tailored for both Arabic and English. Despite its modest size, Mutarjim outperforms much larger models on several established benchmarks, achieved through an optimized two-phase training approach and a carefully curated, high-quality training corpus.. Experimental results show that Mutarjim rivals models up to 20 times larger while significantly reducing computational costs and training requirements. We also introduce Tarjama-25, a new benchmark designed to overcome limitations in existing Arabic-English benchmarking datasets, such as domain narrowness, short sentence lengths, and English-source bias. Tarjama-25 comprises 5,000 expert-reviewed sentence pairs and spans a wide range of domains, offering a more comprehensive and balanced evaluation framework. Notably, Mutarjim achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English-to-Arabic task in Tarjama-25, surpassing even significantly larger and proprietary models like GPT-4o mini. We publicly release Tarjama-25 to support future research and advance the evaluation of Arabic-English translation systems.

<title>Language models can learn implicit multi-hop reasoning, but only if they have lots of training data</title>

arXiv:2505.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit reasoning is the ability of a language model to solve multi-hop reasoning tasks in a single forward pass, without chain of thought. We investigate this capability using GPT2-style language models trained from scratch on controlled $k$-hop reasoning datasets ($k = 2, 3, 4$). We show that while such models can indeed learn implicit $k$-hop reasoning, the required training data grows exponentially in $k$, and the required number of transformer layers grows linearly in $k$. We offer a theoretical explanation for why this depth growth is necessary. We further find that the data requirement can be mitigated, but not eliminated, through curriculum learning.

<title>Handling Symbolic Language in Student Texts: A Comparative Study of NLP Embedding Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have facilitated the analysis of student-generated language products in learning analytics (LA), particularly through the use of NLP embedding models. Yet when it comes to science-related language, symbolic expressions such as equations and formulas introduce challenges that current embedding models struggle to address. Existing studies and applications often either overlook these challenges or remove symbolic expressions altogether, potentially leading to biased findings and diminished performance of LA applications. This study therefore explores how contemporary embedding models differ in their capability to process and interpret science-related symbolic expressions. To this end, various embedding models are evaluated using physics-specific symbolic expressions drawn from authentic student responses, with performance assessed via two approaches: similarity-based analyses and integration into a machine learning pipeline. Our findings reveal significant differences in model performance, with OpenAI's GPT-text-embedding-3-large outperforming all other examined models, though its advantage over other models was moderate rather than decisive. Beyond performance, additional factors such as cost, regulatory compliance, and model transparency are discussed as key considerations for model selection. Overall, this study underscores the importance for LA researchers and practitioners of carefully selecting NLP embedding models when working with science-related language products that include symbolic expressions.

<title>Beyond Distillation: Pushing the Limits of Medical LLM Reasoning with Minimalist Rule-Based RL</title>

arXiv:2505.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving performance on complex tasks and enabling interpretable decision making in large language models (LLMs), especially for clinical applications, requires effective reasoning. Yet this remains challenging without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on costly chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this work, we present AlphaMed, the first medical LLM to show that reasoning capability can emerge purely through reinforcement learning (RL), using minimalist rule-based rewards on public multiple-choice QA datasets, without relying on SFT or distilled CoT data. AlphaMed achieves state-of-the-art results on six medical QA benchmarks, outperforming models trained with conventional SFT+RL pipelines. On challenging benchmarks (e.g., MedXpert), AlphaMed even surpasses larger or closed-source models such as DeepSeek-V3-671B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. To understand the factors behind this success, we conduct a comprehensive data-centric analysis guided by three questions: (i) Can minimalist rule-based RL incentivize reasoning without distilled CoT supervision? (ii) How do dataset quantity and diversity impact reasoning? (iii) How does question difficulty shape the emergence and generalization of reasoning? Our findings show that dataset informativeness is a key driver of reasoning performance, and that minimalist RL on informative, multiple-choice QA data is effective at inducing reasoning without CoT supervision. We also observe divergent trends across benchmarks, underscoring limitations in current evaluation and the need for more challenging, reasoning-oriented medical QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, AI still struggles on advanced mathematics. We consider a difficult open problem: How to derive a Computationally Efficient Equivalent Form (CEEF) for the cycle count statistic? The CEEF problem does not have known general solutions, and requires delicate combinatorics and tedious calculations. Such a task is hard to accomplish by humans but is an ideal example where AI can be very helpful. We solve the problem by combining a novel approach we propose and the powerful coding skills of AI. Our results use delicate graph theory and contain new formulas for general cases that have not been discovered before. We find that, while AI is unable to solve the problem all by itself, it is able to solve it if we provide it with a clear strategy, a step-by-step guidance and carefully written prompts. For simplicity, we focus our study on DeepSeek-R1 but we also investigate other AI approaches.

<title>AVerImaTeC: A Dataset for Automatic Verification of Image-Text Claims with Evidence from the Web</title>

arXiv:2505.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textual claims are often accompanied by images to enhance their credibility and spread on social media, but this also raises concerns about the spread of misinformation. Existing datasets for automated verification of image-text claims remain limited, as they often consist of synthetic claims and lack evidence annotations to capture the reasoning behind the verdict. In this work, we introduce AVerImaTeC, a dataset consisting of 1,297 real-world image-text claims. Each claim is annotated with question-answer (QA) pairs containing evidence from the web, reflecting a decomposed reasoning regarding the verdict. We mitigate common challenges in fact-checking datasets such as contextual dependence, temporal leakage, and evidence insufficiency, via claim normalization, temporally constrained evidence annotation, and a two-stage sufficiency check. We assess the consistency of the annotation in AVerImaTeC via inter-annotator studies, achieving a $\kappa=0.742$ on verdicts and $74.7\%$ consistency on QA pairs. We also propose a novel evaluation method for evidence retrieval and conduct extensive experiments to establish baselines for verifying image-text claims using open-web evidence.

Abstract: Modern transformer models exhibit phase transitions during training, distinct shifts from memorisation to abstraction, but the mechanisms underlying these transitions remain poorly understood. Prior work has often focused on endpoint representations or isolated signals like curvature or mutual information, typically in symbolic or arithmetic domains, overlooking the emergence of linguistic structure. We introduce TRACE (Tracking Representation Abstraction and Compositional Emergence), a diagnostic framework combining geometric, informational, and linguistic signals to detect phase transitions in Transformer-based LMs. TRACE leverages a frame-semantic data generation method, ABSynth, that produces annotated synthetic corpora with controllable complexity, lexical distributions, and structural entropy, while being fully annotated with linguistic categories, enabling precise analysis of abstraction emergence. Experiments reveal that (i) phase transitions align with clear intersections between curvature collapse and dimension stabilisation; (ii) these geometric shifts coincide with emerging syntactic and semantic accuracy; (iii) abstraction patterns persist across architectural variants, with components like feedforward networks affecting optimisation stability rather than fundamentally altering trajectories. This work advances our understanding of how linguistic abstractions emerge in LMs, offering insights into model interpretability, training efficiency, and compositional generalisation that could inform more principled approaches to LM development.

<title>Training with Pseudo-Code for Instruction Following</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid progress in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they continue to have difficulty following relatively simple, unambiguous instructions, especially when compositions are involved. In this paper, we take inspiration from recent work that suggests that models may follow instructions better when they are expressed in pseudo-code. However, writing pseudo-code programs can be tedious and using few-shot demonstrations to craft code representations for use in inference can be unnatural for non-expert users of LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with instruction-tuning data that additionally includes instructions re-expressed in pseudo-code along with the final response. We evaluate models trained using our method on $11$ publicly available benchmarks comprising of tasks related to instruction-following, mathematics, and common-sense reasoning. We conduct rigorous experiments with $5$ different models and find that not only do models follow instructions better when trained with pseudo-code, they also retain their capabilities on the other tasks related to mathematical and common sense reasoning. Specifically, we observe a relative gain of $3$--$19$% on instruction-following benchmark, and an average gain of upto 14% across all tasks.

<title>Contrastive Distillation of Emotion Knowledge from LLMs for Zero-Shot Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: The ability to handle various emotion labels without dedicated training is crucial for building adaptable Emotion Recognition (ER) systems. Conventional ER models rely on training using fixed label sets and struggle to generalize beyond them. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong zero-shot ER performance across diverse label spaces, but their scale limits their use on edge devices. In this work, we propose a contrastive distillation framework that transfers rich emotional knowledge from LLMs into a compact model without the use of human annotations. We use GPT-4 to generate descriptive emotion annotations, offering rich supervision beyond fixed label sets. By aligning text samples with emotion descriptors in a shared embedding space, our method enables zero-shot prediction on different emotion classes, granularity, and label schema. The distilled model is effective across multiple datasets and label spaces, outperforming strong baselines of similar size and approaching GPT-4's zero-shot performance, while being over 10,000 times smaller.

Abstract: Online learning enhances educational accessibility, offering students the flexibility to learn anytime, anywhere. However, a key limitation is the lack of immediate, personalized feedback, particularly in helping students correct errors in math problem-solving. Several studies have investigated the applications of large language models (LLMs) in educational contexts. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to assess students' math problem-solving processes and provide adaptive feedback. The MathEDU dataset is introduced, comprising authentic student solutions annotated with teacher feedback. We evaluate the model's ability to support personalized learning in two scenarios: one where the model has access to students' prior answer histories, and another simulating a cold-start context. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model performs well in identifying correctness. However, the model still faces challenges in generating detailed feedback for pedagogical purposes.

<title>Extended Inductive Reasoning for Personalized Preference Inference from Behavioral Signals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. In contrast to these tasks where deductive reasoning predominates, inductive reasoning\textemdash the ability to derive general rules from incomplete evidence, remains underexplored. This paper investigates extended inductive reasoning in LLMs through the lens of personalized preference inference, a critical challenge in LLM alignment where current approaches struggle to capture diverse user preferences. The task demands strong inductive reasoning capabilities as user preferences are typically embedded implicitly across various interaction forms, requiring models to synthesize consistent preference patterns from scattered signals. We propose \textsc{AlignXplore}, a model that leverages extended reasoning chains to enable systematic preference inference from behavioral signals in users' interaction histories. We develop \textsc{AlignXplore} by combining cold-start training based on synthetic data with subsequent online reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that \textsc{AlignXplore} achieves substantial improvements over the backbone model by an average of 11.05\% on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability across different input formats and downstream models. Further analyses establish best practices for preference inference learning through systematic comparison of reward modeling strategies, while revealing the emergence of human-like inductive reasoning patterns during training.

Abstract: This technical report presents QwenLong-CPRS, a context compression framework designed for explicit long-context optimization, addressing prohibitive computation overhead during the prefill stage and the "lost in the middle" performance degradation of large language models (LLMs) during long sequence processing. Implemented through a novel dynamic context optimization mechanism, QwenLong-CPRS enables multi-granularity context compression guided by natural language instructions, achieving both efficiency gains and improved performance.
  Evolved from the Qwen architecture series, QwenLong-CPRS introduces four key innovations: (1) Natural language-guided dynamic optimization, (2) Bidirectional reasoning layers for enhanced boundary awareness, (3) Token critic mechanisms with language modeling heads, and (4) Window-parallel inference.
  Comprehensive evaluations across five benchmarks (4K-2M word contexts) demonstrate QwenLong-CPRS's threefold effectiveness: (1) Consistent superiority over other context management methods like RAG and sparse attention in both accuracy and efficiency. (2) Architecture-agnostic integration with all flagship LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini2.0-pro, Claude3.7-sonnet, DeepSeek-v3, and Qwen2.5-max, achieves 21.59$\times$ context compression alongside 19.15-point average performance gains; (3) Deployed with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, QwenLong-CPRS surpasses leading proprietary LLMs by 4.85 and 10.88 points on Ruler-128K and InfiniteBench, establishing new SOTA performance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning. Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle, but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue, demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Recent advances in web-augmented large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, yet these capabilities are mostly locked in proprietary systems with opaque architectures. In this work, we propose \textbf{ManuSearch}, a transparent and modular multi-agent framework designed to democratize deep search for LLMs. ManuSearch decomposes the search and reasoning process into three collaborative agents: (1) a solution planning agent that iteratively formulates sub-queries, (2) an Internet search agent that retrieves relevant documents via real-time web search, and (3) a structured webpage reading agent that extracts key evidence from raw web content. To rigorously evaluate deep reasoning abilities, we introduce \textbf{ORION}, a challenging benchmark focused on open-web reasoning over long-tail entities, covering both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that ManuSearch substantially outperforms prior open-source baselines and even surpasses leading closed-source systems. Our work paves the way for reproducible, extensible research in open deep search systems. We release the data and code in https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ManuSearch

arXiv:2505.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans naturally understand moments in a video by integrating visual and auditory cues. For example, localizing a scene in the video like "A scientist passionately speaks on wildlife conservation as dramatic orchestral music plays, with the audience nodding and applauding" requires simultaneous processing of visual, audio, and speech signals. However, existing models often struggle to effectively fuse and interpret audio information, limiting their capacity for comprehensive video temporal understanding. To address this, we present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic video temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and speech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling robust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of available inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated via an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes long-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video analysis. Code and dataset will be publicly released.

<title>UNJOIN: Enhancing Multi-Table Text-to-SQL Generation via Schema Simplification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved Text-to-SQL performance for single-table queries. But, it remains challenging in multi-table databases due to complex schema and relational operations. Existing methods often struggle with retrieving the right tables and columns, generating accurate JOINs and UNIONs, and generalizing across diverse schemas. To address these issues, we introduce UNJOIN, a two-stage framework that decouples the retrieval of schema elements from SQL logic generation. In the first stage, we merge the column names of all tables in the database into a single-table representation by prefixing each column with its table name. This allows the model to focus purely on accurate retrieval without being distracted by the need to write complex SQL logic. In the second stage, the SQL query is generated on this simplified schema and mapped back to the original schema by reconstructing JOINs, UNIONs, and relational logic. Evaluations on SPIDER and BIRD datasets show that UNJOIN matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art baselines. UNJOIN uses only schema information, which does not require data access or fine-tuning, making it scalable and adaptable across databases.

arXiv:2505.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Frankentexts, a new type of long-form narratives produced by LLMs under the extreme constraint that most tokens (e.g., 90%) must be copied verbatim from human writings. This task presents a challenging test of controllable generation, requiring models to satisfy a writing prompt, integrate disparate text fragments, and still produce a coherent narrative. To generate Frankentexts, we instruct the model to produce a draft by selecting and combining human-written passages, then iteratively revise the draft while maintaining a user-specified copy ratio. We evaluate the resulting Frankentexts along three axes: writing quality, instruction adherence, and detectability. Gemini-2.5-Pro performs surprisingly well on this task: 81% of its Frankentexts are coherent and 100% relevant to the prompt. Notably, up to 59% of these outputs are misclassified as human-written by detectors like Pangram, revealing limitations in AI text detectors. Human annotators can sometimes identify Frankentexts through their abrupt tone shifts and inconsistent grammar between segments, especially in longer generations. Beyond presenting a challenging generation task, Frankentexts invite discussion on building effective detectors for this new grey zone of authorship, provide training data for mixed authorship detection, and serve as a sandbox for studying human-AI co-writing processes.

arXiv:2505.18136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a next-generation vandalism detection system for Wikidata, one of the largest open-source structured knowledge bases on the Web. Wikidata is highly complex: its items incorporate an ever-expanding universe of factual triples and multilingual texts. While edits can alter both structured and textual content, our approach converts all edits into a single space using a method we call Graph2Text. This allows for evaluating all content changes for potential vandalism using a single multilingual language model. This unified approach improves coverage and simplifies maintenance. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms the current production system. Additionally, we are releasing the code under an open license along with a large dataset of various human-generated knowledge alterations, enabling further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges with needle-in-a-haystack tasks, where relevant information ("the needle") must be drawn from a large pool of irrelevant context ("the haystack"). Previous studies have highlighted positional bias and distractor quantity as critical factors affecting model performance, yet the influence of gold context size has received little attention. We address this gap by systematically studying how variations in gold context length impact LLM performance on long-context question answering tasks. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops sharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts consistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity, posing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered, fine-grained information of varying lengths. This pattern holds across three diverse domains (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical reasoning) and seven state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes and architectures. Our work provides clear insights to guide the design of robust, context-aware LLM-driven systems.

<title>First Finish Search: Efficient Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS), which involves dynamic allocation of compute during inference, offers a promising way to improve reasoning in large language models. While existing TTS methods work well, they often rely on long decoding paths or require a large number of samples to be generated, increasing the token usage and inference latency. We observe the surprising fact that for reasoning tasks, shorter traces are much more likely to be correct than longer ones. Motivated by this, we introduce First Finish Search (FFS), a training-free parallel decoding strategy that launches $n$ independent samples and returns as soon as any one completes. We evaluate FFS alongside simple decoding, beam search, majority voting, and budget forcing on four reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, QwQ-32B and Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus) and across four datasets (AIME24, AIME25-I, AIME25-II and GPQA Diamond). With DeepSeek-R1, FFS achieves $82.23\%$ accuracy on the AIME datasets, a $15\%$ improvement over DeepSeek-R1's standalone accuracy, nearly matching OpenAI's o4-mini performance. Our theoretical analysis explains why stopping at the shortest trace is likely to yield a correct answer and identifies the conditions under which early stopping may be suboptimal. The elegance and simplicity of FFS demonstrate that straightforward TTS strategies can perform remarkably well, revealing the untapped potential of simple approaches at inference time.

<title>Fann or Flop: A Multigenre, Multiera Benchmark for Arabic Poetry Understanding in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Arabic poetry stands as one of the most sophisticated and culturally embedded forms of expression in the Arabic language, known for its layered meanings, stylistic diversity, and deep historical continuity. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across languages and tasks, their ability to understand Arabic poetry remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce `Fann or Flop`, the first benchmark designed to assess the comprehension of Arabic poetry by LLMs in twelve historical eras, covering 21 core poetic genres and a variety of metrical forms, from classical structures to contemporary free verse. The benchmark comprises a curated corpus of poems with explanations that assess semantic understanding, metaphor interpretation, prosodic awareness, and cultural context. We argue that poetic comprehension offers a strong indicator for testing how good the LLM is in understanding classical Arabic through the Arabic poetry. Unlike surface-level tasks, this domain demands deeper interpretive reasoning and cultural sensitivity. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs shows that most models struggle with poetic understanding despite strong results on standard Arabic benchmarks. We release `Fann or Flop` along with the evaluation suite as an open-source resource to enable rigorous evaluation and advancement for Arabic language models. Code is available at: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/FannOrFlop.

Abstract: Ethical decision-making is a critical aspect of human judgment, and the growing use of LLMs in decision-support systems necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their moral reasoning capabilities. However, existing assessments primarily rely on single-step evaluations, failing to capture how models adapt to evolving ethical challenges. Addressing this gap, we introduce the Multi-step Moral Dilemmas (MMDs), the first dataset specifically constructed to evaluate the evolving moral judgments of LLMs across 3,302 five-stage dilemmas. This framework enables a fine-grained, dynamic analysis of how LLMs adjust their moral reasoning across escalating dilemmas. Our evaluation of nine widely used LLMs reveals that their value preferences shift significantly as dilemmas progress, indicating that models recalibrate moral judgments based on scenario complexity. Furthermore, pairwise value comparisons demonstrate that while LLMs often prioritize the value of care, this value can sometimes be superseded by fairness in certain contexts, highlighting the dynamic and context-dependent nature of LLM ethical reasoning. Our findings call for a shift toward dynamic, context-aware evaluation paradigms, paving the way for more human-aligned and value-sensitive development of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language tasks, and recent efforts have sought to extend their capabilities to multimodal domains and resource-constrained environments. However, existing approaches often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning or assume fixed training conditions, limiting their generalization when facing unseen modalities, limited data, or restricted compute resources. This dissertation presents a systematic study toward generalizing LLM usability under real-world constraints. First, it introduces a robust text-centric alignment framework that enables LLMs to seamlessly integrate diverse modalities-including text, images, tables, and any modalities - via natural language interfaces. This approach supports in-context adaptation to unseen or dynamically changing modalities without requiring retraining. To enhance robustness against noisy and missing modalities, an adversarial prompting technique is proposed, generating semantically challenging perturbations at the prompt level to stress-test model reliability. Beyond multimodal setting, the dissertation investigates inference-time optimization strategies for LLMs, leveraging prompt search and uncertainty quantification to improve performance without additional model training. This perspective offers an efficient alternative to scaling model parameters or retraining from scratch. Additionally, the work addresses low-resource domains such as Verilog code generation by designing correct-by-construction synthetic data pipelines and logic-enhanced reasoning models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal data. Together, these contributions form a unified effort to enhance the adaptability, scalability, and efficiency of large language models under practical constraints.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is transforming how English as a foreign language students write. Still, little is known about how students manipulate text generated by generative AI during the writing process. This study investigates how EFL secondary school students integrate and modify AI-generated text when completing an expository writing task. The study employed an exploratory mixed-methods design. Screen recordings were collected from 29 Hong Kong secondary school students who attended an AI-assisted writing workshop and recorded their screens while using generative AI to write an article. Content analysis with hierarchical coding and thematic analysis with a multiple case study approach were adopted to analyze the recordings. 15 types of AI-generated text edits across seven categories were identified from the recordings. Notably, AI-initiated edits from iOS and Google Docs emerged as unanticipated sources of AI-generated text. A thematic analysis revealed four patterns of students' editing behaviors based on planning and drafting direction: planning with top-down drafting and revising; top-down drafting and revising without planning; planning with bottom-up drafting and revising; and bottom-up drafting and revising without planning. Network graphs illustrate cases of each pattern, demonstrating that students' interactions with AI-generated text involve more complex cognitive processes than simple text insertion. The findings challenge assumptions about students' passive, simplistic use of generative AI tools and have implications for developing explicit instructional approaches to teaching AI-generated text editing strategies in the AFL writing pedagogy.

<title>Safety Alignment Can Be Not Superficial With Explicit Safety Signals</title>

Abstract: Recent studies on the safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) have revealed that existing approaches often operate superficially, leaving models vulnerable to various adversarial attacks. Despite their significance, these studies generally fail to offer actionable solutions beyond data augmentation for achieving more robust safety mechanisms. This paper identifies a fundamental cause of this superficiality: existing alignment approaches often presume that models can implicitly learn a safety-related reasoning task during the alignment process, enabling them to refuse harmful requests. However, the learned safety signals are often diluted by other competing objectives, leading models to struggle with drawing a firm safety-conscious decision boundary when confronted with adversarial attacks. Based on this observation, by explicitly introducing a safety-related binary classification task and integrating its signals with our attention and decoding strategies, we eliminate this ambiguity and allow models to respond more responsibly to malicious queries. We emphasize that, with less than 0.2x overhead cost, our approach enables LLMs to assess the safety of both the query and the previously generated tokens at each necessary generating step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the resilience of LLMs against various adversarial attacks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust generative AI systems.

<title>GSDFuse: Capturing Cognitive Inconsistencies from Multi-Dimensional Weak Signals in Social Media Steganalysis</title>

Abstract: The ubiquity of social media platforms facilitates malicious linguistic steganography, posing significant security risks. Steganalysis is profoundly hindered by the challenge of identifying subtle cognitive inconsistencies arising from textual fragmentation and complex dialogue structures, and the difficulty in achieving robust aggregation of multi-dimensional weak signals, especially given extreme steganographic sparsity and sophisticated steganography. These core detection difficulties are compounded by significant data imbalance. This paper introduces GSDFuse, a novel method designed to systematically overcome these obstacles. GSDFuse employs a holistic approach, synergistically integrating hierarchical multi-modal feature engineering to capture diverse signals, strategic data augmentation to address sparsity, adaptive evidence fusion to intelligently aggregate weak signals, and discriminative embedding learning to enhance sensitivity to subtle inconsistencies. Experiments on social media datasets demonstrate GSDFuse's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in identifying sophisticated steganography within complex dialogue environments. The source code for GSDFuse is available at https://github.com/NebulaEmmaZh/GSDFuse.

Abstract: Recent progress in speech recognition has relied on models trained on vast amounts of labeled data. However, classroom Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) faces the real-world challenge of abundant weak transcripts paired with only a small amount of accurate, gold-standard data. In such low-resource settings, high transcription costs make re-transcription impractical. To address this, we ask: what is the best approach when abundant inexpensive weak transcripts coexist with limited gold-standard data, as is the case for classroom speech data? We propose Weakly Supervised Pretraining (WSP), a two-step process where models are first pretrained on weak transcripts in a supervised manner, and then fine-tuned on accurate data. Our results, based on both synthetic and real weak transcripts, show that WSP outperforms alternative methods, establishing it as an effective training methodology for low-resource ASR in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework to control voice style in prompt-based, controllable text-to-speech systems by leveraging textual personas as voice style prompts. We present two persona rewriting strategies to transform generic persona descriptions into speech-oriented prompts, enabling fine-grained manipulation of prosodic attributes such as pitch, emotion, and speaking rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods enhance the naturalness, clarity, and consistency of synthesized speech. Finally, we analyze implicit social biases introduced by LLM-based rewriting, with a focus on gender. We underscore voice style as a crucial factor for persona-driven AI dialogue systems.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) enables large vision-language models (LVLMs) to efficiently adapt to novel tasks, supporting a wide array of real-world applications. However, multimodal ICL remains unstable, and current research largely focuses on optimizing sequence configuration while overlooking the internal mechanisms of LVLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis of attentional dynamics in multimodal ICL and identify three core limitations of standard attention that ICL impair performance. To address these challenges, we propose Context-Aware Modulated Attention (CAMA), a simple yet effective plug-and-play method for directly calibrating LVLM attention logits. CAMA is training-free and can be seamlessly applied to various open-source LVLMs. We evaluate CAMA on four LVLMs across six benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and generality. CAMA opens new opportunities for deeper exploration and targeted utilization of LVLM attention dynamics to advance multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Open-weight general-purpose AI (GPAI) models offer significant benefits but also introduce substantial cybersecurity risks, as demonstrated by the offensive capabilities of models like DeepSeek-R1 in evaluations such as MITRE's OCCULT. These publicly available models empower a wider range of actors to automate and scale cyberattacks, challenging traditional defence paradigms and regulatory approaches. This paper analyzes the specific threats -- including accelerated malware development and enhanced social engineering -- magnified by open-weight AI release. We critically assess current regulations, notably the EU AI Act and the GPAI Code of Practice, identifying significant gaps stemming from the loss of control inherent in open distribution, which renders many standard security mitigations ineffective. We propose a path forward focusing on evaluating and controlling specific high-risk capabilities rather than entire models, advocating for pragmatic policy interpretations for open-weight systems, promoting defensive AI innovation, and fostering international collaboration on standards and cyber threat intelligence (CTI) sharing to ensure security without unduly stifling open technological progress.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit visual-textual interactions to bypass safety guardrails. In this paper, we present DTR, a novel inference-time defense that mitigates multimodal jailbreak attacks through optimizing the model's key-value (KV) caches. Rather than relying on curated safety-specific data or costly image-to-text conversion, we introduce a new formulation of the safety-relevant distributional shift induced by the visual modality. This formulation enables DTR to dynamically adjust visual token weights, minimizing the impact of adversarial visual inputs while preserving the model's general capabilities and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluation across diverse VLMs and attack benchmarks demonstrates that \sys outperforms existing defenses in both attack robustness and benign task performance, marking the first successful application of KV cache optimization for safety enhancement in multimodal foundation models. The code for replicating DTR is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DTR-2755 (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by VLMs.)

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate exceptional capability in tackling complex mathematical, logical, and coding tasks by leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Test-time scaling methods, such as prolonging CoT with explicit token-level exploration, can push LRMs' accuracy boundaries, but they incur significant decoding overhead. A key inefficiency source is LRMs often generate redundant thinking CoTs, which demonstrate clear structured overthinking and underthinking patterns. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning processes and numerical optimization theories, we propose TrimR, a verifier-based, training-free, efficient framework for dynamic CoT compression to trim reasoning and enhance test-time scaling, explicitly tailored for production-level deployment. Our method employs a lightweight, pretrained, instruction-tuned verifier to detect and truncate redundant intermediate thoughts of LRMs without any LRM or verifier fine-tuning. We present both the core algorithm and asynchronous online system engineered for high-throughput industrial applications. Empirical evaluations on Ascend NPUs and vLLM show that our framework delivers substantial gains in inference efficiency under large-batch workloads. In particular, on the four MATH500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA benchmarks, the reasoning runtime of Pangu-R-38B, QwQ-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B is improved by up to 70% with negligible impact on accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal slow-thinking systems have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse visual reasoning tasks. However, their capabilities in text-rich image reasoning tasks remain understudied due to the lack of a systematic benchmark. To address this gap, we propose OCR-Reasoning, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess Multimodal Large Language Models on text-rich image reasoning tasks. The benchmark comprises 1,069 human-annotated examples spanning 6 core reasoning abilities and 18 practical reasoning tasks in text-rich visual scenarios. Furthermore, unlike other text-rich image understanding benchmarks that only annotate the final answers, OCR-Reasoning also annotates the reasoning process simultaneously. With the annotated reasoning process and the final answers, OCR-Reasoning evaluates not only the final answers generated by models but also their reasoning processes, enabling a holistic analysis of their problem-solving abilities. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our results demonstrate the limitations of existing methodologies. Notably, even state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit substantial difficulties, with none achieving accuracy surpassing 50\% across OCR-Reasoning, indicating that the challenges of text-rich image reasoning are an urgent issue to be addressed. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/OCR-Reasoning.

Abstract: Data visualizations are powerful tools for communicating patterns in quantitative data. Yet understanding any data visualization is no small feat -- succeeding requires jointly making sense of visual, numerical, and linguistic inputs arranged in a conventionalized format one has previously learned to parse. Recently developed vision-language models are, in principle, promising candidates for developing computational models of these cognitive operations. However, it is currently unclear to what degree these models emulate human behavior on tasks that involve reasoning about data visualizations. This gap reflects limitations in prior work that has evaluated data visualization understanding in artificial systems using measures that differ from those typically used to assess these abilities in humans. Here we evaluated eight vision-language models on six data visualization literacy assessments designed for humans and compared model responses to those of human participants. We found that these models performed worse than human participants on average, and this performance gap persisted even when using relatively lenient criteria to assess model performance. Moreover, while relative performance across items was somewhat correlated between models and humans, all models produced patterns of errors that were reliably distinct from those produced by human participants. Taken together, these findings suggest significant opportunities for further development of artificial systems that might serve as useful models of how humans reason about data visualizations. All code and data needed to reproduce these results are available at: https://osf.io/e25mu/?view_only=399daff5a14d4b16b09473cf19043f18.

Abstract: Charts play a critical role in data analysis and visualization, yet real-world applications often present charts with challenging or noisy features. However, "outlier charts" pose a substantial challenge even for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can struggle to interpret perturbed charts. In this work, we introduce CHAOS (CHart Analysis with Outlier Samples), a robustness benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs against chart perturbations. CHAOS encompasses five types of textual and ten types of visual perturbations, each presented at three levels of severity (easy, mid, hard) inspired by the study result of human evaluation. The benchmark includes 13 state-of-the-art MLLMs divided into three groups (i.e., general-, document-, and chart-specific models) according to the training scope and data. Comprehensive analysis involves two downstream tasks (ChartQA and Chart-to-Text). Extensive experiments and case studies highlight critical insights into robustness of models across chart perturbations, aiming to guide future research in chart understanding domain. Data and code are publicly available at: http://huggingface.co/datasets/omoured/CHAOS.

Abstract: With the growing demand for deploying large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications, improving their inference efficiency is crucial for sustainable and democratized access. However, retraining LLMs to meet new user-specific requirements is prohibitively expensive and environmentally unsustainable. In this work, we propose a practical and scalable alternative: composing efficient hybrid language models from existing pre-trained models. Our approach, Zebra-Llama, introduces a family of 1B, 3B, and 8B hybrid models by combining State Space Models (SSMs) and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) layers, using a refined initialization and post-training pipeline to efficiently transfer knowledge from pre-trained Transformers. Zebra-Llama achieves Transformer-level accuracy with near-SSM efficiency using only 7-11B training tokens (compared to trillions of tokens required for pre-training) and an 8B teacher. Moreover, Zebra-Llama dramatically reduces KV cache size -down to 3.9%, 2%, and 2.73% of the original for the 1B, 3B, and 8B variants, respectively-while preserving 100%, 100%, and >97% of average zero-shot performance on LM Harness tasks. Compared to models like MambaInLLaMA, X-EcoMLA, Minitron, and Llamba, Zebra-Llama consistently delivers competitive or superior accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens, smaller teachers, and vastly reduced KV cache memory. Notably, Zebra-Llama-8B surpasses Minitron-8B in few-shot accuracy by 7% while using 8x fewer training tokens, over 12x smaller KV cache, and a smaller teacher (8B vs. 15B). It also achieves 2.6x-3.8x higher throughput (tokens/s) than MambaInLlama up to a 32k context length. We will release code and model checkpoints upon acceptance.

Abstract: Token embeddings play a crucial role in language modeling but, despite this practical relevance, their theoretical understanding remains limited. Our paper addresses the gap by characterizing the structure of embeddings obtained via gradient descent. Specifically, we consider a one-layer softmax attention model with a linear head for binary classification, i.e., $\texttt{Softmax}( p^\top E_X^\top ) E_X v = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_i}) E_{x_i}^\top v}{\sum_{j=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_{j}}) }$, where $E_X = [ E_{x_1} , \dots, E_{x_T} ]^\top$ contains the embeddings of the input sequence, $p$ is the embedding of the $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ token and $v$ the output vector. First, we show that, already after a single step of gradient training with the logistic loss, the embeddings $E_X$ capture the importance of tokens in the dataset by aligning with the output vector $v$ proportionally to the frequency with which the corresponding tokens appear in the dataset. Then, after training $p$ via gradient flow until convergence, the softmax selects the important tokens in the sentence (i.e., those that are predictive of the label), and the resulting $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ embedding maximizes the margin for such a selection. Experiments on real-world datasets (IMDB, Yelp) exhibit a phenomenology close to that unveiled by our theory.

Abstract: Recent language models exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, yet the influence of long-context capacity on reasoning remains underexplored. In this work, we hypothesize that current limitations in reasoning stem, in part, from insufficient long-context capacity, motivated by empirical observations such as (1) higher context window length often leads to stronger reasoning performance, and (2) failed reasoning cases resemble failed long-context cases. To test this hypothesis, we examine whether enhancing a model's long-context ability before Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) leads to improved reasoning performance. Specifically, we compared models with identical architectures and fine-tuning data but varying levels of long-context capacity. Our results reveal a consistent trend: models with stronger long-context capacity achieve significantly higher accuracy on reasoning benchmarks after SFT. Notably, these gains persist even on tasks with short input lengths, indicating that long-context training offers generalizable benefits for reasoning performance. These findings suggest that long-context modeling is not just essential for processing lengthy inputs, but also serves as a critical foundation for reasoning. We advocate for treating long-context capacity as a first-class objective in the design of future language models.

<title>Analyzing Fine-Grained Alignment and Enhancing Vision Understanding in Multimodal Language Models</title>

Abstract: Achieving better alignment between vision embeddings and Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing the abilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly for recent models that rely on powerful pretrained vision encoders and LLMs. A common approach to connect the pretrained vision encoder and LLM is through a projector applied after the vision encoder. However, the projector is often trained to enable the LLM to generate captions, and hence the mechanism by which LLMs understand each vision token remains unclear. In this work, we first investigate the role of the projector in compressing vision embeddings and aligning them with word embeddings. We show that the projector significantly compresses visual information, removing redundant details while preserving essential elements necessary for the LLM to understand visual content. We then examine patch-level alignment -- the alignment between each vision patch and its corresponding semantic words -- and propose a *multi-semantic alignment hypothesis*. Our analysis indicates that the projector trained by caption loss improves patch-level alignment but only to a limited extent, resulting in weak and coarse alignment. To address this issue, we propose *patch-aligned training* to efficiently enhance patch-level alignment. Our experiments show that patch-aligned training (1) achieves stronger compression capability and improved patch-level alignment, enabling the MLLM to generate higher-quality captions, (2) improves the MLLM's performance by 16% on referring expression grounding tasks, 4% on question-answering tasks, and 3% on modern instruction-following benchmarks when using the same supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. The proposed method can be easily extended to other multimodal models.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Few Shot Domain Adapting Graph (FS-DAG), a scalable and efficient model architecture for visually rich document understanding (VRDU) in few-shot settings. FS-DAG leverages domain-specific and language/vision specific backbones within a modular framework to adapt to diverse document types with minimal data. The model is robust to practical challenges such as handling OCR errors, misspellings, and domain shifts, which are critical in real-world deployments. FS-DAG is highly performant with less than 90M parameters, making it well-suited for complex real-world applications for Information Extraction (IE) tasks where computational resources are limited. We demonstrate FS-DAG's capability through extensive experiments for information extraction task, showing significant improvements in convergence speed and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, this work highlights the ongoing progress in developing smaller, more efficient models that do not compromise on performance. Code : https://github.com/oracle-samples/fs-dag

Abstract: This paper introduces ECHO-LLaMA, an efficient LLaMA architecture designed to improve both the training speed and inference throughput of LLaMA architectures while maintaining its learning capacity. ECHO-LLaMA transforms LLaMA models into shared KV caching across certain layers, significantly reducing KV computational complexity while maintaining or improving language performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO-LLaMA achieves up to 77\% higher token-per-second throughput during training, up to 16\% higher Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU), and up to 14\% lower loss when trained on an equal number of tokens. Furthermore, on the 1.1B model, ECHO-LLaMA delivers approximately 7\% higher test-time throughput compared to the baseline. By introducing a computationally efficient adaptation mechanism, ECHO-LLaMA offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for pretraining and finetuning large language models, enabling faster and more resource-efficient training without compromising performance.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) tasks pose a unique challenge for small language models (SLMs) with limited scale, which often lack the capacity to perform deep social reasoning. In this work, we propose DEL-ToM, a framework that improves ToM reasoning through inference-time scaling rather than architectural changes. Our approach decomposes ToM tasks into a sequence of belief updates grounded in Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), enabling structured and transparent reasoning. We train a verifier, called the Process Belief Model (PBM), to score each belief update step using labels generated automatically via a DEL simulator. During inference, candidate belief traces generated by a language model are evaluated by the PBM, and the highest-scoring trace is selected. This allows SLMs to emulate more deliberate reasoning by allocating additional compute at test time. Experiments across multiple model scales and benchmarks show that DEL-ToM consistently improves performance, demonstrating that verifiable belief supervision can significantly enhance ToM abilities of SLMs without retraining.

Abstract: Child literacy is a strong predictor of life outcomes at the subsequent stages of an individual's life. This points to a need for targeted interventions in vulnerable low and middle income populations to help bridge the gap between literacy levels in these regions and high income ones. In this effort, reading assessments provide an important tool to measure the effectiveness of these programs and AI can be a reliable and economical tool to support educators with this task. Developing accurate automatic reading assessment systems for child speech in low-resource languages poses significant challenges due to limited data and the unique acoustic properties of children's voices. This study focuses on Xhosa, a language spoken in South Africa, to advance child speech recognition capabilities. We present a novel dataset composed of child speech samples in Xhosa. The dataset is available upon request and contains ten words and letters, which are part of the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) system. Each recording is labeled with an online and cost-effective approach by multiple markers and a subsample is validated by an independent EGRA reviewer. This dataset is evaluated with three fine-tuned state-of-the-art end-to-end models: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and Whisper. The results indicate that the performance of these models can be significantly influenced by the amount and balancing of the available training data, which is fundamental for cost-effective large dataset collection. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that the wav2vec 2.0 performance is improved by training on multiple classes at a time, even when the number of available samples is constrained.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method for value model training on long-context reasoning traces. Compared to existing process reward models (PRMs), our method does not require a fine-grained notion of "step," which is difficult to define for long-context reasoning models. By collecting a dataset of 2.5 million reasoning traces, we train a 1.5B token-level value model and apply it to DeepSeek models for improved performance with test-time compute scaling. We find that block-wise value-guided search (VGS) with a final weighted majority vote achieves better test-time scaling than standard methods such as majority voting or best-of-n. With an inference budget of 64 generations, VGS with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-1.5B achieves an average accuracy of 45.7% across four competition math benchmarks (AIME 2024 & 2025, HMMT Feb 2024 & 2025), reaching parity with o3-mini-medium. Moreover, VGS significantly reduces the inference FLOPs required to achieve the same performance of majority voting. Our dataset, model and codebase are open-sourced.

Abstract: The field of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made remarkable progress in visual understanding tasks, presenting a vast opportunity to predict the perceptual and emotional impact of charts. However, it also raises concerns, as many applications of LLMs are based on overgeneralized assumptions from a few examples, lacking sufficient validation of their performance and effectiveness. We introduce Chart-to-Experience, a benchmark dataset comprising 36 charts, evaluated by crowdsourced workers for their impact on seven experiential factors. Using the dataset as ground truth, we evaluated capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs on two tasks: direct prediction and pairwise comparison of charts. Our findings imply that MLLMs are not as sensitive as human evaluators when assessing individual charts, but are accurate and reliable in pairwise comparisons.

Abstract: Generative error correction (GER) with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as an effective post-processing approach to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. However, it often struggles with rare or domain-specific words due to limited training data. Furthermore, existing LLM-based GER approaches primarily rely on textual information, neglecting phonetic cues, which leads to over-correction. To address these issues, we propose a novel LLM-based GER approach that targets rare words and incorporates phonetic information. First, we generate synthetic data to contain rare words for fine-tuning the GER model. Second, we integrate ASR's N-best hypotheses along with phonetic context to mitigate over-correction. Experimental results show that our method not only improves the correction of rare words but also reduces the WER and CER across both English and Japanese datasets.

Abstract: The rapid growth of voice assistants powered by large language models (LLM) has highlighted a need for speech instruction data to train these systems. Despite the abundance of speech recognition data, there is a notable scarcity of speech instruction data, which is essential for fine-tuning models to understand and execute spoken commands. Generating high-quality synthetic speech requires a good text-to-speech (TTS) model, which may not be available to low resource languages. Our novel approach addresses this challenge by halting synthesis at the semantic representation level, bypassing the need for TTS. We achieve this by aligning synthetic semantic representations with the pre-trained Whisper encoder, enabling an LLM to be fine-tuned on text instructions while maintaining the ability to understand spoken instructions during inference. This simplified training process is a promising approach to building voice assistant for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Multimodal models like CLIP have gained significant attention due to their remarkable zero-shot performance across various tasks. However, studies have revealed that CLIP can inadvertently learn spurious associations between target variables and confounding factors. To address this, we introduce \textsc{Locate-Then-Correct} (LTC), a contrastive framework that identifies spurious attention heads in Vision Transformers via mechanistic insights and mitigates them through targeted ablation. Furthermore, LTC identifies salient, task-relevant attention heads, enabling the integration of discriminative features through orthogonal projection to improve classification performance. We evaluate LTC on benchmarks with inherent background and gender biases, achieving over a $>50\%$ gain in worst-group accuracy compared to non-training post-hoc baselines. Additionally, we visualize the representation of selected heads and find that the presented interpretation corroborates our contrastive mechanism for identifying both spurious and salient attention heads.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance by generating reasoning paths before final answers, but learning such a reasoning path requires costly human supervision. To address this issue, recent studies have explored self-training methods that improve reasoning capabilities using pseudo-labels generated by the LLMs themselves. Among these, confidence-based self-training fine-tunes LLMs to prefer reasoning paths with high-confidence answers, where confidence is estimated via majority voting. However, such methods exclusively focus on the quality of the final answer and may ignore the quality of the reasoning paths, as even an incorrect reasoning path leads to a correct answer by chance. Instead, we advocate the use of reasoning-level confidence to identify high-quality reasoning paths for self-training, supported by our empirical observations. We then propose a new self-training method, CORE-PO, that fine-tunes LLMs to prefer high-COnfidence REasoning paths through Policy Optimization. Our experiments show that CORE-PO improves the accuracy of outputs on four in-distribution and two out-of-distribution benchmarks, compared to existing self-training methods.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly being applied to a wide range of real-world multimodal applications, involving complex visual and linguistic reasoning. As these models become more integrated into practical use, they are expected to handle complex aspects of human interaction. Among these, color perception is a fundamental yet highly variable aspect of visual understanding. It differs across individuals due to biological factors such as Color Vision Deficiencies (CVDs), as well as differences in culture and language. Despite its importance, perceptual diversity has received limited attention. In our study, we evaluate LVLMs' ability to account for individual level perceptual variation using the Ishihara Test, a widely used method for detecting CVDs. Our results show that LVLMs can explain CVDs in natural language, but they cannot simulate how people with CVDs perceive color in image based tasks. These findings highlight the need for multimodal systems that can account for color perceptual diversity and support broader discussions on perceptual inclusiveness and fairness in multimodal AI.

Abstract: Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements, including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce OrionBench, a benchmark designed to support the development of accurate object detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 26,250 real and 78,750 synthetic infographics, with over 6.9 million bounding box annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of OrionBench through three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI element detection.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-oriented LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and science examinations. However, core cognitive faculties of human intelligence, such as abstract reasoning and generalization, remain underexplored. To address this, we evaluate recent reasoning-oriented LLMs on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, which explicitly demands both faculties. We formulate ARC as a program synthesis task and propose nine candidate solvers. Experimental results show that repeated-sampling planning-aided code generation (RSPC) achieves the highest test accuracy and demonstrates consistent generalization across most LLMs. To further improve performance, we introduce an ARC solver, Knowledge Augmentation for Abstract Reasoning (KAAR), which encodes core knowledge priors within an ontology that classifies priors into three hierarchical levels based on their dependencies. KAAR progressively expands LLM reasoning capacity by gradually augmenting priors at each level, and invokes RSPC to generate candidate solutions after each augmentation stage. This stage-wise reasoning reduces interference from irrelevant priors and improves LLM performance. Empirical results show that KAAR maintains strong generalization and consistently outperforms non-augmented RSPC across all evaluated LLMs, achieving around 5% absolute gains and up to 64.52% relative improvement. Despite these achievements, ARC remains a challenging benchmark for reasoning-oriented LLMs, highlighting future avenues of progress in LLMs.

Abstract: Project duplication detection is critical for project quality assessment, as it improves resource utilization efficiency by preventing investing in newly proposed project that have already been studied. It requires the ability to understand high-level semantics and generate constructive and valuable feedback. Existing detection methods rely on basic word- or sentence-level comparison or solely apply large language models, lacking valuable insights for experts and in-depth comprehension of project content and review criteria. To tackle this issue, we propose PD$^3$, a Project Duplication Detection framework via adapted multi-agent Debate. Inspired by real-world expert debates, it employs a fair competition format to guide multi-agent debate to retrieve relevant projects. For feedback, it incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analysis to improve its practicality. Over 800 real-world power project data spanning more than 20 specialized fields are used to evaluate the framework, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches by 7.43% and 8.00% in two downstream tasks. Furthermore, we establish an online platform, Review Dingdang, to assist power experts, saving 5.73 million USD in initial detection on more than 100 newly proposed projects.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by capturing complex interactions between input features. To identify these interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n \approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy, we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over marginal attribution approaches while using $10\times$ fewer inferences than SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX identifies features that influence model output over 20% more than those selected by marginal approaches. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on a question-answering task. ProxySPEX identifies interactions that enable more aggressive pruning of heads than marginal approaches.

Abstract: Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the widespread use of Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization in policy gradient algorithms to stabilize training, the systematic exploration of how different KL divergence formulations can be estimated and integrated into surrogate loss functions for online reinforcement learning (RL) presents a nuanced and systematically explorable design space. In this paper, we propose regularized policy gradient (RPG), a systematic framework for deriving and analyzing KL-regularized policy gradient methods in the online RL setting. We derive policy gradients and corresponding surrogate loss functions for objectives regularized by both forward and reverse KL divergences, considering both normalized and unnormalized policy distributions. Furthermore, we present derivations for fully differentiable loss functions as well as REINFORCE-style gradient estimators, accommodating diverse algorithmic needs. We conduct extensive experiments on RL for LLM reasoning using these methods, showing improved or competitive results in terms of training stability and performance compared to strong baselines such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and DAPO. The code is available at https://github.com/complex-reasoning/RPG.

Abstract: Concepts represent generalized abstractions that enable humans to categorize and reason efficiently, yet it is unclear to what extent Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehend these semantic relationships. Existing benchmarks typically focus on factual recall and isolated tasks, failing to evaluate the ability of LLMs to understand conceptual boundaries. To address this gap, we introduce CK-Arena, a multi-agent interaction game built upon the Undercover game, designed to evaluate the capacity of LLMs to reason with concepts in interactive settings. CK-Arena challenges models to describe, differentiate, and infer conceptual boundaries based on partial information, encouraging models to explore commonalities and distinctions between closely related concepts. By simulating real-world interaction, CK-Arena provides a scalable and realistic benchmark for assessing conceptual reasoning in dynamic environments. Experimental results show that LLMs' understanding of conceptual knowledge varies significantly across different categories and is not strictly aligned with parameter size or general model capabilities. The data and code are available at the project homepage: https://ck-arena.site.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech technologies have enabled realistic voice generation, fueling audio-based deepfake attacks such as fraud and impersonation. While audio anti-spoofing systems are critical for detecting such threats, prior work has predominantly focused on acoustic-level perturbations, leaving the impact of linguistic variation largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the linguistic sensitivity of both open-source and commercial anti-spoofing detectors by introducing transcript-level adversarial attacks. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even minor linguistic perturbations can significantly degrade detection accuracy: attack success rates surpass 60% on several open-source detector-voice pairs, and notably one commercial detection accuracy drops from 100% on synthetic audio to just 32%. Through a comprehensive feature attribution analysis, we identify that both linguistic complexity and model-level audio embedding similarity contribute strongly to detector vulnerability. We further demonstrate the real-world risk via a case study replicating the Brad Pitt audio deepfake scam, using transcript adversarial attacks to completely bypass commercial detectors. These results highlight the need to move beyond purely acoustic defenses and account for linguistic variation in the design of robust anti-spoofing systems. All source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: In the era of rapid generative AI development, interactions between humans and large language models face significant misusing risks. Previous research has primarily focused on black-box scenarios using human-guided prompts and white-box scenarios leveraging gradient-based LLM generation methods, neglecting the possibility that LLMs can act not only as victim models, but also as attacker models to harm other models. We proposes a novel jailbreaking method inspired by the Chain-of-Thought mechanism, where the attacker model uses mission transfer to conceal harmful user intent in dialogue and generates chained narrative lures to stimulate the reasoning capabilities of victim models, leading to successful jailbreaking. To enhance the attack success rate, we introduce a helper model that performs random narrative optimization on the narrative lures during multi-turn dialogues while ensuring alignment with the original intent, enabling the optimized lures to bypass the safety barriers of victim models effectively. Our experiments reveal that models with weaker safety mechanisms exhibit stronger attack capabilities, demonstrating that models can not only be exploited, but also help harm others. By incorporating toxicity scores, we employ third-party models to evaluate the harmfulness of victim models' responses to jailbreaking attempts. The study shows that using refusal keywords as an evaluation metric for attack success rates is significantly flawed because it does not assess whether the responses guide harmful questions, while toxicity scores measure the harm of generated content with more precision and its alignment with harmful questions. Our approach demonstrates outstanding performance, uncovering latent vulnerabilities in LLMs and providing data-driven feedback to optimize LLM safety mechanisms. We also discuss two defensive strategies to offer guidance on improving defense mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper presents a pioneering exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) via group relative policy optimization for unified multimodal large language models (ULMs), aimed at simultaneously reinforcing generation and understanding capabilities. Through systematic pilot studies, we uncover the significant potential of ULMs to enable the synergistic co-evolution of dual capabilities within a shared policy optimization framework. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{CoRL}, a co-reinforcement learning framework comprising a unified RL stage for joint optimization and a refined RL stage for task-specific enhancement. With the proposed CoRL, our resulting model, \textbf{ULM-R1}, achieves average improvements of \textbf{7%} on three text-to-image generation datasets and \textbf{23%} on nine multimodal understanding benchmarks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRL and highlight the substantial benefit of reinforcement learning in facilitating cross-task synergy and optimization for ULMs.

<title>CoMoE: Contrastive Representation for Mixture-of-Experts in Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: In parameter-efficient fine-tuning, mixture-of-experts (MoE), which involves specializing functionalities into different experts and sparsely activating them appropriately, has been widely adopted as a promising approach to trade-off between model capacity and computation overhead. However, current MoE variants fall short on heterogeneous datasets, ignoring the fact that experts may learn similar knowledge, resulting in the underutilization of MoE's capacity. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Representation for MoE (CoMoE), a novel method to promote modularization and specialization in MoE, where the experts are trained along with a contrastive objective by sampling from activated and inactivated experts in top-k routing. We demonstrate that such a contrastive objective recovers the mutual-information gap between inputs and the two types of experts. Experiments on several benchmarks and in multi-task settings demonstrate that CoMoE can consistently enhance MoE's capacity and promote modularization among the experts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across domains but face significant challenges when deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or personal devices such as laptops, due to high memory consumption and inference costs. Post-training quantization (PTQ) of LLMs offers a promising solution that reduces their memory footprint and decoding latency. In practice, PTQ with uniform quantization representation is favored for its efficiency and ease of deployment since uniform quantization is widely supported by mainstream hardware and software libraries. Recent studies on $\geq 2$-bit uniform quantization have led to noticeable improvements in post-quantization model performance; however, they primarily focus on quantization methodologies, while the initialization of quantization parameters is underexplored and still relies on the suboptimal Min-Max strategies. In this work, we propose NeUQI, a method devoted to efficiently determining near-optimal initial parameters for uniform quantization. NeUQI is orthogonal to prior quantization methodologies and can seamlessly integrate with them. The experiments with the LLaMA and Qwen families on various tasks demonstrate that our NeUQI consistently outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, when combined with a lightweight distillation strategy, NeUQI can achieve superior performance to PV-tuning, a much more resource-intensive approach.

<title>One Model Transfer to All: On Robust Jailbreak Prompts Generation against LLMs</title>

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly compromised by jailbreak attacks, which can manipulate these models to generate harmful or unintended content. Investigating these attacks is crucial for uncovering model vulnerabilities. However, many existing jailbreak strategies fail to keep pace with the rapid development of defense mechanisms, such as defensive suffixes, rendering them ineffective against defended models. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel attack method called ArrAttack, specifically designed to target defended LLMs. ArrAttack automatically generates robust jailbreak prompts capable of bypassing various defense measures. This capability is supported by a universal robustness judgment model that, once trained, can perform robustness evaluation for any target model with a wide variety of defenses. By leveraging this model, we can rapidly develop a robust jailbreak prompt generator that efficiently converts malicious input prompts into effective attacks. Extensive evaluations reveal that ArrAttack significantly outperforms existing attack strategies, demonstrating strong transferability across both white-box and black-box models, including GPT-4 and Claude-3. Our work bridges the gap between jailbreak attacks and defenses, providing a fresh perspective on generating robust jailbreak prompts. We make the codebase available at https://github.com/LLBao/ArrAttack.

Abstract: This work presents a dual-agent Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning method for mechanism synthesis, capable of reasoning at both linguistic and symbolic levels to generate geometrical and dynamic outcomes. The model consists of a composition of well-defined functions that, starting from a natural language specification, references abstract properties through supporting equations, generates and parametrizes simulation code, and elicits feedback anchor points using symbolic regression and distance functions. This process closes an actionable refinement loop at the linguistic and symbolic layers. The approach is shown to be both effective and convergent in the context of planar mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce MSynth, a novel benchmark for planar mechanism synthesis, and perform a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the model components. We further demonstrate that symbolic regression prompts unlock mechanistic insights only when applied to sufficiently large architectures.

Abstract: Automatically evaluating multimodal generation presents a significant challenge, as automated metrics often struggle to align reliably with human evaluation, especially for complex tasks that involve multiple modalities. To address this, we present MMMG, a comprehensive and human-aligned benchmark for multimodal generation across 4 modality combinations (image, audio, interleaved text and image, interleaved text and audio), with a focus on tasks that present significant challenges for generation models, while still enabling reliable automatic evaluation through a combination of models and programs. MMMG encompasses 49 tasks (including 29 newly developed ones), each with a carefully designed evaluation pipeline, and 937 instructions to systematically assess reasoning, controllability, and other key capabilities of multimodal generation models. Extensive validation demonstrates that MMMG is highly aligned with human evaluation, achieving an average agreement of 94.3%. Benchmarking results on 24 multimodal generation models reveal that even though the state-of-the-art model, GPT Image, achieves 78.3% accuracy for image generation, it falls short on multimodal reasoning and interleaved generation. Furthermore, results suggest considerable headroom for improvement in audio generation, highlighting an important direction for future research.

Abstract: Predicting human daily behavior is challenging due to the complexity of routine patterns and short-term fluctuations. While data-driven models have improved behavior prediction by leveraging empirical data from various platforms and devices, the reliance on sensitive, large-scale user data raises privacy concerns and limits data availability. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution, though existing methods are often limited to specific applications. In this work, we introduce BehaviorGen, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality synthetic behavior data. By simulating user behavior based on profiles and real events, BehaviorGen supports data augmentation and replacement in behavior prediction models. We evaluate its performance in scenarios such as pertaining augmentation, fine-tuning replacement, and fine-tuning augmentation, achieving significant improvements in human mobility and smartphone usage predictions, with gains of up to 18.9%. Our results demonstrate the potential of BehaviorGen to enhance user behavior modeling through flexible and privacy-preserving synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Various AI safety datasets have been developed to measure LLMs against evolving interpretations of harm. Our evaluation of five recently published open-source safety benchmarks reveals distinct semantic clusters using UMAP dimensionality reduction and kmeans clustering (silhouette score: 0.470). We identify six primary harm categories with varying benchmark representation. GretelAI, for example, focuses heavily on privacy concerns, while WildGuardMix emphasizes self-harm scenarios. Significant differences in prompt length distribution suggests confounds to data collection and interpretations of harm as well as offer possible context. Our analysis quantifies benchmark orthogonality among AI benchmarks, allowing for transparency in coverage gaps despite topical similarities. Our quantitative framework for analyzing semantic orthogonality across safety benchmarks enables more targeted development of datasets that comprehensively address the evolving landscape of harms in AI use, however that is defined in the future.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in smart homes must understand human behavior through diverse sensory inputs and communicate via natural language. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled impressive language-grounded perception, their reliance on visual data limits robustness in real-world scenarios with occlusions, poor lighting, or privacy constraints. In this paper, we introduce HoloLLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates uncommon but powerful sensing modalities, such as LiDAR, infrared, mmWave radar, and WiFi, to enable seamless human perception and reasoning across heterogeneous environments. We address two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of aligned modality-text data for rare sensors, and (2) the heterogeneity of their physical signal representations. To overcome these, we design a Universal Modality-Injection Projector (UMIP) that enhances pre-aligned modality embeddings with fine-grained, text-aligned features from tailored encoders via coarse-to-fine cross-attention without introducing significant alignment overhead. We further introduce a human-VLM collaborative data curation pipeline to generate paired textual annotations for sensing datasets. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmarks show that HoloLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, improving language-grounded human sensing accuracy by up to 30%. This work establishes a new foundation for real-world, language-informed multisensory embodied intelligence.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The growing size of large language models has created significant computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference, reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN, leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5% ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4% better performance preservation compared to existing methods. Our specialized kernel implementations effectively realize these theoretical gains into substantial real-world acceleration.

Abstract: Despite Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) dominating policy gradient methods -- from robotic control to game AI -- its static trust region forces a brittle trade-off: aggressive clipping stifles early exploration, while late-stage updates destabilize convergence. PPO-BR establishes a new paradigm in adaptive RL by fusing exploration and convergence signals into a single bounded trust region -- a theoretically grounded innovation that outperforms five SOTA baselines with less than 2% overhead. This work bridges a critical gap in phase-aware learning, enabling real-world deployment in safety-critical systems like robotic surgery within a single adaptive mechanism. PPO-BR achieves 29.1% faster convergence by combining: (1) entropy-driven expansion (epsilon up) for exploration in high-uncertainty states, and (2) reward-guided contraction (epsilon down) for convergence stability. On six diverse benchmarks (MuJoCo, Atari, sparse-reward), PPO-BR achieves 29.1% faster convergence (p < 0.001), 2.3x lower reward variance than PPO, and less than 1.8% runtime overhead with only five lines of code change. PPO-BR's simplicity and theoretical guarantees make it ready-to-deploy in safety-critical domains -- from surgical robotics to autonomous drones. In contrast to recent methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), PPO-BR offers a unified entropy-reward mechanism applicable to both language models and general reinforcement learning environments.

Abstract: Doctor-patient consultations require multi-turn, context-aware communication tailored to diverse patient personas. Training or evaluating doctor LLMs in such settings requires realistic patient interaction systems. However, existing simulators often fail to reflect the full range of personas seen in clinical practice. To address this, we introduce PatientSim, a patient simulator that generates realistic and diverse patient personas for clinical scenarios, grounded in medical expertise. PatientSim operates using: 1) clinical profiles, including symptoms and medical history, derived from real-world data in the MIMIC-ED and MIMIC-IV datasets, and 2) personas defined by four axes: personality, language proficiency, medical history recall level, and cognitive confusion level, resulting in 37 unique combinations. We evaluated eight LLMs for factual accuracy and persona consistency. The top-performing open-source model, Llama 3.3, was validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness of our framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides a reproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific training needs. Offering a privacy-compliant environment, it serves as a robust testbed for evaluating medical dialogue systems across diverse patient presentations and shows promise as an educational tool for healthcare.

Abstract: The rapid progress in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation has created an urgent need for interpretable automatic evaluation methods that can assess the quality of generated images, therefore reducing the human annotation burden. To reduce the prohibitive cost of relying on commercial models for large-scale evaluation, and to improve the reasoning capabilities of open-source models, recent research has explored supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as dedicated T2I evaluators. However, SFT approaches typically rely on high-quality critique datasets, which are either generated by proprietary LLMs-with potential issues of bias and inconsistency-or annotated by humans at high cost, limiting their scalability and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-Eval-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains open-source MLLMs using only coarse-grained quality scores, thereby avoiding the need for annotating high-quality interpretable evaluation rationale. Our approach integrates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the instruction-tuning process, enabling models to generate both scalar scores and interpretable reasoning chains with only easy accessible annotated judgment scores or preferences. Furthermore, we introduce a continuous reward formulation that encourages score diversity and provides stable optimization signals, leading to more robust and discriminative evaluation behavior. Experimental results on three established T2I meta-evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that T2I-Eval-R1 achieves significantly higher alignment with human assessments and offers more accurate interpretable score rationales compared to strong baseline methods.

Abstract: The complexity of code reviews has driven efforts to automate review comments, but prior approaches oversimplify this task by treating it as snippet-level code-to-text generation and relying on text similarity metrics like BLEU for evaluation. These methods overlook repository context, real-world merge request evaluation, and defect detection, limiting their practicality. To address these issues, we explore the full automation pipeline within the online recommendation service of a company with nearly 400 million daily active users, analyzing industry-grade C++ codebases comprising hundreds of thousands of lines of code. We identify four key challenges: 1) capturing relevant context, 2) improving key bug inclusion (KBI), 3) reducing false alarm rates (FAR), and 4) integrating human workflows. To tackle these, we propose 1) code slicing algorithms for context extraction, 2) a multi-role LLM framework for KBI, 3) a filtering mechanism for FAR reduction, and 4) a novel prompt design for better human interaction. Our approach, validated on real-world merge requests from historical fault reports, achieves a 2x improvement over standard LLMs and a 10x gain over previous baselines. While the presented results focus on C++, the underlying framework design leverages language-agnostic principles (e.g., AST-based analysis), suggesting potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: Interpretability researchers have attempted to understand MLP neurons of language models based on both the contexts in which they activate and their output weight vectors. They have paid little attention to a complementary aspect: the interactions between input and output. For example, when neurons detect a direction in the input, they might add much the same direction to the residual stream ("enrichment neurons") or reduce its presence ("depletion neurons"). We address this aspect by examining the cosine similarity between input and output weights of a neuron. We apply our method to 12 models and find that enrichment neurons dominate in early-middle layers whereas later layers tend more towards depletion. To explain this finding, we argue that enrichment neurons are largely responsible for enriching concept representations, one of the first steps of factual recall. Our input-output perspective is a complement to activation-dependent analyses and to approaches that treat input and output separately.

<title>Are Large Language Models Reliable AI Scientists? Assessing Reverse-Engineering of Black-Box Systems</title>

Abstract: Using AI to create autonomous researchers has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery. A prerequisite for this vision is understanding how well an AI model can identify the underlying structure of a black-box system from its behavior. In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM) learns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively collected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs across three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent different problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have considerable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through extensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from observations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of Bayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only observe but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific inputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs to test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data from one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of engaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling results in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that engaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes: overcomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the black-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations. These insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively reverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new discoveries.

Abstract: The VAPO framework has demonstrated significant empirical success in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of reinforcement learning for long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks with large language models (LLMs). By systematically addressing challenges such as value model bias, heterogeneous sequence lengths, and sparse reward signals, VAPO achieves state-of-the-art performance. While its practical benefits are evident, a deeper theoretical understanding of its underlying mechanisms and potential limitations is crucial for guiding future advancements. This paper aims to initiate such a discussion by exploring VAPO from a theoretical perspective, highlighting areas where its assumptions might be challenged and where further investigation could yield more robust and generalizable reasoning agents. We delve into the intricacies of value function approximation in complex reasoning spaces, the optimality of adaptive advantage estimation, the impact of token-level optimization, and the enduring challenges of exploration and generalization.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in the field, LLMs remain unreliable in distinguishing causation from correlation. Recent results from the Corr2Cause dataset benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs -- such as GPT-4 (F1 score: 29.08) -- only marginally outperform random baselines (Random Uniform, F1 score: 20.38), indicating limited capacity of generalization. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel structured approach: rather than directly answering causal queries, we provide the model with the capability to structure its thinking by guiding the model to build a structured knowledge graph, systematically encoding the provided correlational premises, to answer the causal queries. This intermediate representation significantly enhances the model's causal capabilities. Experiments on the test subset of the Corr2Cause dataset benchmark with Qwen3-32B model (reasoning model) show substantial gains over standard direct prompting methods, improving F1 scores from 32.71 to 48.26 (over 47.5% relative increase), along with notable improvements in precision and recall. These results underscore the effectiveness of providing the model with the capability to structure its thinking and highlight its promising potential for broader generalization across diverse causal inference tasks.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code will be released later.

<title>Data Mixing Can Induce Phase Transitions in Knowledge Acquisition</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained on data mixtures: most data come from web scrapes, while a small portion is curated from high-quality sources with dense domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we show that when training LLMs on such data mixtures, knowledge acquisition from knowledge-dense datasets, unlike training exclusively on knowledge-dense data (arXiv:2404.05405), does not always follow a smooth scaling law but can exhibit phase transitions with respect to the mixing ratio and model size. Through controlled experiments on a synthetic biography dataset mixed with web-scraped data, we demonstrate that: (1) as we increase the model size to a critical value, the model suddenly transitions from memorizing very few to most of the biographies; (2) below a critical mixing ratio, the model memorizes almost nothing even with extensive training, but beyond this threshold, it rapidly memorizes more biographies. We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity allocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack problem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation across datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio varies. We formalize this intuition in an information-theoretic framework and reveal that these phase transitions are predictable, with the critical mixing ratio following a power-law relationship with the model size. Our findings highlight a concrete case where a good mixing recipe for large models may not be optimal for small models, and vice versa.

<title>How Can I Publish My LLM Benchmark Without Giving the True Answers Away?</title>

Abstract: Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.

<title>Bridging Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning in Math Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has played a central role in the recent surge of LLMs' math abilities by enabling self-improvement through binary verifier signals. In contrast, Supervised Learning (SL) is rarely considered for such verification-driven training, largely due to its heavy reliance on reference answers and inability to reflect on mistakes. In this work, we challenge the prevailing notion that self-improvement is exclusive to RL and propose Negative-aware Fine-Tuning (NFT) -- a supervised approach that enables LLMs to reflect on their failures and improve autonomously with no external teachers. In online training, instead of throwing away self-generated negative answers, NFT constructs an implicit negative policy to model them. This implicit policy is parameterized with the same positive LLM we target to optimize on positive data, enabling direct policy optimization on all LLMs' generations. We conduct experiments on 7B and 32B models in math reasoning tasks. Results consistently show that through the additional leverage of negative feedback, NFT significantly improves over SL baselines like Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning, matching or even surpassing leading RL algorithms like GRPO and DAPO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NFT and GRPO are actually equivalent in strict-on-policy training, even though they originate from entirely different theoretical foundations. Our experiments and theoretical findings bridge the gap between SL and RL methods in binary-feedback learning systems.

Abstract: LLM-based (Large Language Model) GUI (Graphical User Interface) agents can potentially reshape our daily lives significantly. However, current LLM-based GUI agents suffer from the scarcity of high-quality training data owing to the difficulties of trajectory collection and reward annotation. Existing works have been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to offer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model (ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can over-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories. To this end, we propose Progress Reward Model (ProgRM) to provide dense informative intermediate rewards by predicting a task completion progress for each step in online training. To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation, we further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence) self-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign progress labels accordingly. ProgRM is evaluated with extensive experiments and analyses. Actors trained with ProgRM outperform leading proprietary LLMs and ORM-trained actors, illustrating the effectiveness of ProgRM. The codes for experiments will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across many domains, it has historically underperformed on tabular learning tasks, which remain dominated by gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs). However, recent advancements are paving the way for Tabular Foundation Models, which can leverage real-world knowledge and generalize across diverse datasets, particularly when the data contains free-text. Although incorporating language model capabilities into tabular tasks has been explored, most existing methods utilize static, target-agnostic textual representations, limiting their effectiveness. We introduce TabSTAR: a Foundation Tabular Model with Semantically Target-Aware Representations. TabSTAR is designed to enable transfer learning on tabular data with textual features, with an architecture free of dataset-specific parameters. It unfreezes a pretrained text encoder and takes as input target tokens, which provide the model with the context needed to learn task-specific embeddings. TabSTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance for both medium- and large-sized datasets across known benchmarks of classification tasks with text features, and its pretraining phase exhibits scaling laws in the number of datasets, offering a pathway for further performance improvements.

<title>Reward Model Overoptimisation in Iterated RLHF</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption, the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the use of RL beyond reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored, especially for perceptionintensive tasks like object detection and grounding. We propose V-Triune, a Visual Triple Unified Reinforcement Learning system that enables VLMs to jointly learn visual reasoning and perception tasks within a single training pipeline. V-Triune comprises triple complementary components: Sample-Level Data Formatting (to unify diverse task inputs), Verifier-Level Reward Computation (to deliver custom rewards via specialized verifiers) , and Source-Level Metric Monitoring (to diagnose problems at the data-source level). We further introduce a novel Dynamic IoU reward, which provides adaptive, progressive, and definite feedback for perception tasks handled by V-Triune. Our approach is instantiated within off-the-shelf RL training framework using open-source 7B and 32B backbone models. The resulting model, dubbed Orsta (One RL to See Them All), demonstrates consistent improvements across both reasoning and perception tasks. This broad capability is significantly shaped by its training on a diverse dataset, constructed around four representative visual reasoning tasks (Math, Puzzle, Chart, and Science) and four visual perception tasks (Grounding, Detection, Counting, and OCR). Subsequently, Orsta achieves substantial gains on MEGA-Bench Core, with improvements ranging from +2.1 to an impressive +14.1 across its various 7B and 32B model variants, with performance benefits extending to a wide range of downstream tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our unified RL approach for VLMs. The V-Triune system, along with the Orsta models, is publicly available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI.

<title>VideoGameBench: Can Vision-Language Models complete popular video games?</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved strong results on coding and math benchmarks that are challenging for humans, yet their ability to perform tasks that come naturally to humans--such as perception, spatial navigation, and memory management--remains understudied. Real video games are crafted to be intuitive for humans to learn and master by leveraging innate inductive biases, making them an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities in VLMs. To this end, we introduce VideoGameBench, a benchmark consisting of 10 popular video games from the 1990s that VLMs directly interact with in real-time. VideoGameBench challenges models to complete entire games with access to only raw visual inputs and a high-level description of objectives and controls, a significant departure from existing setups that rely on game-specific scaffolding and auxiliary information. We keep three of the games secret to encourage solutions that generalize to unseen environments. Our experiments show that frontier vision-language models struggle to progress beyond the beginning of each game. We find inference latency to be a major limitation of frontier models in the real-time setting; therefore, we introduce VideoGameBench Lite, a setting where the game pauses while waiting for the LM's next action. The best performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, completes only 0.48% of VideoGameBench and 1.6% of VideoGameBench Lite. We hope that the formalization of the human skills mentioned above into this benchmark motivates progress in these research directions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now access a wide range of external tools, thanks to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This greatly expands their abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set of 10 different models. These phenomenons, while giving developers a powerful way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable impacts across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks. Fine-tuning these pretrained models on downstream datasets provides further significant performance gains; however, this process typically requires a large number of expensive, high-end GPUs. Although there have been efforts focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, they cannot fully unlock the powerful potential of full-parameter fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose QFT, a Quantized Full-parameter Tuning framework for LLMs that quantizes and stores all training states, including weights, gradients, and optimizer states, in INT8 format to reduce training memory, thereby enabling full-parameter fine-tuning on existing GPUs at an affordable cost. To ensure training performance, we make two key efforts: i) for quantized gradients and optimizer states, we theoretically prove that the Lion optimizer, with its property of consistent update magnitudes, is highly robust to quantization; ii) and for quantized weights, we employ the hybrid feature quantizer, which identifies and protects a small subset of sparse critical features while quantizing the remaining dense features, thus ensuring accurate weight updates without FP32 backups. Moreover, to support backpropagation in the integer context, we develop a stack-based gradient flow scheme with O(1) complexity, forming a unified integer training pipeline. As a result, QFT reduces the model state memory to 21% of the standard solution while achieving comparable performance, e.g., tuning a LLaMA-7B model requires only <30GB of memory, making it feasible on a single A6000 GPU.

Abstract: Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire knowledge from their training corpora, the memorization of sensitive information in the corpora such as copyrighted, biased, and private content has led to ethical and legal concerns. In response to these challenges, unlearning has emerged as a potential remedy for LLMs affected by problematic training data. However, previous unlearning techniques are either not applicable to black-box LLMs due to required access to model internal weights, or violate data protection principles by retaining sensitive data for inference-time correction. We propose {\delta}-Unlearning, an offset unlearning framework for black-box LLMs. Instead of tuning the black-box LLM itself, {\delta}-Unlearning learns the logit offset needed for unlearning by contrasting the logits from a pair of smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that {\delta}- Unlearning can effectively unlearn target data while maintaining similar or even stronger performance on general out-of-forget-scope tasks. {\delta}-Unlearning also effectively incorporates different unlearning algorithms, making our approach a versatile solution to adapting various existing unlearning algorithms to black-box LLMs.

Abstract: The article develops a generative model of the human translating mind, grounded in empirical translation process data. It posits that three embedded processing layers unfold concurrently in the human mind, and their traces are detectable in behavioral data: sequences of routinized/automated processes are observable in fluent translation production, cognitive/reflective thoughts lead to longer keystroke pauses, while affective/emotional states may be identified through characteristic typing and gazing patterns. Utilizing data from the CRITT Translation Process Research Database (TPR-DB), the article illustrates how the temporal structure of keystroke and gaze data can be related to the three assumed hidden mental processing strata. The article relates this embedded generative model to various theoretical frameworks, dual-process theories and Robinson's (2023) ideosomatic theory of translation, opening exciting new theoretical horizons for Cognitive Translation Studies, grounded in empirical data and evaluation.

Abstract: Active learning is designed to minimize annotation efforts by prioritizing instances that most enhance learning. However, many active learning strategies struggle with a `cold-start' problem, needing substantial initial data to be effective. This limitation reduces their utility in the increasingly relevant few-shot scenarios, where the instance selection has a substantial impact. To address this, we introduce ActiveLLM, a novel active learning approach that leverages Large Language Models such as GPT-4, o1, Llama 3, or Mistral Large for selecting instances. We demonstrate that ActiveLLM significantly enhances the classification performance of BERT classifiers in few-shot scenarios, outperforming traditional active learning methods as well as improving the few-shot learning methods ADAPET, PERFECT, and SetFit. Additionally, ActiveLLM can be extended to non-few-shot scenarios, allowing for iterative selections. In this way, ActiveLLM can even help other active learning strategies to overcome their cold-start problem. Our results suggest that ActiveLLM offers a promising solution for improving model performance across various learning setups.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities. However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the transparency and fair use of the data used in their pretraining. Detecting such content is challenging due to the scale of the data and limited exposure of each instance during training. We propose ReCaLL (Relative Conditional Log-Likelihood), a novel membership inference attack (MIA) to detect LLMs' pretraining data by leveraging their conditional language modeling capabilities. ReCaLL examines the relative change in conditional log-likelihoods when prefixing target data points with non-member context. Our empirical findings show that conditioning member data on non-member prefixes induces a larger decrease in log-likelihood compared to non-member data. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that ReCaLL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WikiMIA dataset, even with random and synthetic prefixes, and can be further improved using an ensemble approach. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLMs' behavior with different membership contexts, providing insights into how LLMs leverage membership information for effective inference at both the sequence and token level.

Abstract: We find that language models have difficulties generating fallacious and deceptive reasoning. When asked to generate deceptive outputs, language models tend to leak honest counterparts but believe them to be false. Exploiting this deficiency, we propose a jailbreak attack method that elicits an aligned language model for malicious output. Specifically, we query the model to generate a fallacious yet deceptively real procedure for the harmful behavior. Since a fallacious procedure is generally considered fake and thus harmless by LLMs, it helps bypass the safeguard mechanism. Yet the output is factually harmful since the LLM cannot fabricate fallacious solutions but proposes truthful ones. We evaluate our approach over five safety-aligned large language models, comparing four previous jailbreak methods, and show that our approach achieves competitive performance with more harmful outputs. We believe the findings could be extended beyond model safety, such as self-verification and hallucination.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks. To enhance credibility and verifiability in RAG systems, Attributed Text Generation (ATG) is proposed, which provides citations to retrieval knowledge in LLM-generated responses. Prior methods mainly adopt coarse-grained attributions, with passage-level or paragraph-level references or citations, which fall short in verifiability. This paper proposes ReClaim (Refer & Claim), a fine-grained ATG method that alternates the generation of references and answers step by step. Different from previous coarse-grained attribution, ReClaim provides sentence-level citations in long-form question-answering tasks. With extensive experiments, we verify the effectiveness of ReClaim in extensive settings, achieving a citation accuracy rate of 90%.

Abstract: This study addresses a critical gap in safety tuning practices for Large Language Models (LLMs) by identifying and tackling a refusal position bias within safety tuning data, which compromises the models' ability to appropriately refuse generating unsafe content. We introduce a novel approach, Decoupled Refusal Training (DeRTa), designed to empower LLMs to refuse compliance to harmful prompts at any response position, significantly enhancing their safety capabilities. DeRTa incorporates two novel components: (1) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Harmful Response Prefix, which trains models to recognize and avoid unsafe content by appending a segment of harmful response to the beginning of a safe response, and (2) Reinforced Transition Optimization (RTO), which equips models with the ability to transition from potential harm to safety refusal consistently throughout the harmful response sequence. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using LLaMA3 and Mistral model families across six attack scenarios, demonstrates that our method not only improves model safety without compromising performance but also surpasses baseline methods in defending against attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality instruction data for effective alignment, particularly in code generation tasks where expert curated datasets are expensive to produce. We present Genetic-Instruct, a scalable algorithm for synthesizing large-scale, high quality coding instructions using evolutionary principles. Starting from a small set of seed instructions, Genetic-Instruct generates diverse and challenging instruction-code pairs by leveraging an Instructor-LLM for generation, a Coder-LLM for code synthesis, and a Judge-LLM for automatic quality evaluation. Our proposed approach is highly parallelizable and effective even with a small seed data and weaker generator models. We generated more than 7.5 million coding instructions with the proposed approach. Then we evaluated it by fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic samples and demonstrated a significant improvement in their code generation capability compared to the other synthetic generation approaches and publicly available datasets. Our results highlight the efficiency, scalability, and generalizability of the Genetic-Instruct framework.

Abstract: In recent years, Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their superior performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies may diminish their reasoning capabilities markedly when problem descriptions contain irrelevant information, even with the use of advanced prompting techniques. To further investigate this issue, a dataset of primary school mathematics problems containing irrelevant information, named GSMIR, was constructed. Testing prominent LLMs and prompting techniques on this dataset revealed that while LLMs can identify irrelevant information, they do not effectively mitigate the interference it causes once identified. A novel automatic construction method, ATF, which enhances the ability of LLMs to identify and self-mitigate the influence of irrelevant information, is proposed to address this shortcoming. This method operates in two steps: first, analysis of irrelevant information, followed by its filtering. The ATF method, as demonstrated by experimental results, significantly improves the reasoning performance of LLMs and prompting techniques, even in the presence of irrelevant information on the GSMIR dataset.

Abstract: Audio language models process audio inputs using textual prompts for tasks like speech recognition and audio captioning. Although built on multilingual pre-trained components, most are trained primarily on English, limiting their usability for other languages. This paper evaluates audio language models on Thai, a low-resource language, and finds that they lack emergent cross-lingual abilities despite their multilingual foundations. To address this, we explore data mixtures that optimize audio language models for both a target language and English while integrating audio comprehension and speech instruction-following into a unified model. Our experiments provide insights into improving instruction-following in low-resource languages by balancing language-specific and multilingual training data. The proposed model, Typhoon-Audio, significantly outperforms existing open-source models and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art Gemini-1.5-Pro in both English and Thai.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has gained interest in speech-text multimodal foundation models, achieving strong performance on instruction-tuned speech translation (ST). However, expanding language pairs is costly due to re-training on combined new and previous datasets. To address this, we aim to build a one-to-many ST system from existing one-to-one ST systems using task arithmetic without re-training. Direct application of task arithmetic in ST leads to language confusion; therefore, we introduce an augmented task arithmetic method incorporating a language control model to ensure correct target language generation. Our experiments on MuST-C and CoVoST-2 show BLEU score improvements of up to 4.66 and 4.92, with COMET gains of 8.87 and 11.83. In addition, we demonstrate our framework can extend to language pairs lacking paired ST training data or pre-trained ST models by synthesizing ST models based on existing machine translation (MT) and ST models via task analogies.

<title>From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including human evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark, exhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links, bold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit these biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval and LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where current preference models favor longer responses that appear more comprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter, competing responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely underexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in preference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a comprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show that with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject significant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also be easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n sampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the format than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the need to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms and evaluating models.

Abstract: Recently, using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has led to considerable improvements in unsupervised sentence embedding models. However, existing methods encounter two primary challenges: limited data diversity and high data noise. Current approaches often neglect fine-grained knowledge, such as entities and quantities, leading to insufficient diversity. Besides, unsupervised data frequently lacks discriminative information, and the generated synthetic samples may introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline-based data augmentation method via LLMs and introduce the Gaussian-decayed gradient-assisted Contrastive Sentence Embedding (GCSE) model to enhance unsupervised sentence embeddings. To tackle the issue of low data diversity, our pipeline utilizes knowledge graphs (KGs) to extract entities and quantities, enabling LLMs to generate more diverse samples. To address high data noise, the GCSE model uses a Gaussian-decayed function to limit the impact of false hard negative samples, enhancing the model's discriminative capability. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, using fewer data samples and smaller LLMs, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness across various models.

<title>Position IDs Matter: An Enhanced Position Layout for Efficient Context Compression in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Using special tokens (e.g., gist, memory, or compressed tokens) to compress context information is a common practice for large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often neglect that position encodings inherently induce local inductive biases in models, causing the compression process to ignore holistic contextual dependencies. We propose Enhanced Position Layout (EPL), a simple yet effective method that improves the context compression capability of LLMs by only adjusting position IDs, the numerical identifiers that specify token positions. EPL minimizes the distance between context tokens and their corresponding special tokens and at the same time maintains the sequence order in position IDs between context tokens, special tokens, and the subsequent tokens. Integrating EPL into our best performing context compression model results in 1.9 ROUGE-1 F1 improvement on out-of-domain question answering datasets in average. When extended to multimodal scenarios, EPL brings an average accuracy gain of 2.6 to vision compression LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and derivative techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are task-alignment algorithms used to repurpose general, foundational models for specific tasks. We show that applying task-alignment to neural machine translation (NMT) addresses an existing task--data mismatch in NMT, leading to improvements across all languages of a multilingual model, even when task-alignment is only applied to a subset of those languages. We do so by introducing Direct Quality Optimization (DQO), a variant of DPO leveraging a pre-trained translation quality estimation model as a proxy for human preferences, and verify the improvements with both automatic metrics and human evaluation.

Abstract: LLM evaluation benchmarks have traditionally separated the testing of knowledge/reasoning capabilities from instruction following. In this work, we study the interaction between knowledge and instruction following, and observe that LLMs struggle to follow simple answer modifying instructions, and are also distracted by instructions that should have no bearing on the original knowledge task answer. We leverage existing multiple-choice answer based knowledge benchmarks and apply a set of simple instructions which include manipulating text (eg.: change case), numeric quantities (eg.: increase value, change formatting), operate on lists (eg.: sort answer candidates) and distractor instructions (eg.: change case of numeric answers). We evaluate models at varying parameter sizes (1B-405B) from different model families and find that, surprisingly, all models report a significant drop in performance on such simple task compositions. While large-sized and frontier models report performance drops of 40-50%, in small and medium sized models the drop is severe (sometimes exceeding 80%). Our results highlight a limitation in the traditional separation of knowledge/reasoning and instruction following, and suggest that joint-study of these capabilities are important. We release our benchmark dataset, evaluation framework code, and results for future work.

Abstract: Although fact verification remains fundamental, explanation generation serves as a critical enabler for trustworthy fact-checking systems by producing interpretable rationales and facilitating comprehensive verification processes. However, current benchmarks have limitations that include the lack of impact assessment, insufficient high-quality explanatory annotations, and an English-centric bias. To address these, we introduce TrendFact, the first hotspot perception fact-checking benchmark that comprehensively evaluates fact verification, evidence retrieval, and explanation generation tasks. TrendFact consists of 7,643 carefully curated samples sourced from trending platforms and professional fact-checking datasets, as well as an evidence library of 66,217 entries with publication dates. We further propose two metrics, ECS and HCPI, to complement existing benchmarks by evaluating the system's explanation consistency and hotspot perception capability, respectively. Experimental results show that current fact-checking systems, including advanced RLMs such as DeepSeek-R1, face significant limitations when evaluated on TrendFact, highlighting the real-world challenges posed by it. To enhance the fact-checking capabilities of reasoning large language models (RLMs), we propose FactISR, which integrates dynamic evidence augmentation, evidence triangulation, and an iterative self-reflection mechanism. Accordingly, FactISR effectively improves RLM performance, offering new insights for explainable and complex fact-checking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet their improvement methods remain fundamentally constrained by human design. We present Self-Developing, a framework that enables LLMs to autonomously discover, implement, and refine their own improvement algorithms. Our approach employs an iterative cycle where a seed model generates algorithmic candidates as executable code, evaluates their effectiveness, and uses Direct Preference Optimization to recursively improve increasingly sophisticated improvement strategies. We demonstrate this framework through model merging, a practical technique for combining specialized models. Self-Developing successfully discovered novel merging algorithms that outperform existing human-designed algorithms. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, the autonomously discovered algorithms improve the seed model's GSM8k performance by 6\% and exceed human-designed approaches like Task Arithmetic by 4.3\%. Remarkably, these algorithms exhibit strong generalization, achieving 7.4\% gains on out-of-domain models without re-optimization. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can transcend their training to invent genuinely novel optimization techniques. This capability represents a crucial step toward a new era where LLMs not only solve problems but autonomously develop the methodologies for their own advancement.

Abstract: Learning from human feedback has enabled the alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences. However, collecting human preferences is expensive and time-consuming, with highly variable annotation quality. An appealing alternative is to distill preferences from LMs as a source of synthetic annotations, offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative, albeit susceptible to other biases and errors. In this work, we introduce HyPER, a Hybrid Preference routER that defers an annotation to either humans or LMs, achieving better annotation quality while reducing the cost of human-only annotation. We formulate this as an optimization problem: given a preference dataset and an evaluation metric, we (1) train a performance prediction model (PPM) to predict a reward model's (RM) performance on an arbitrary combination of human and LM annotations and (2) employ a routing strategy that selects a combination that maximizes the predicted performance. We train the PPM on MultiPref, a new preference dataset with 10k instances paired with humans and LM labels. We show that the selected hybrid mixture of synthetic and direct human preferences using HyPER achieves better RM performance compared to using either one exclusively by 7-13% on RewardBench and generalizes across unseen preference datasets and other base models. We also observe the same trend in other benchmarks using Best-of-N reranking, where the hybrid mix has 2-3% better performance. Finally, we analyze features from HyPER and find that prompts with moderate safety concerns or complexity benefit the most from human feedback.

Abstract: As the demand for processing extended textual data grows, the ability to handle long-range dependencies and maintain computational efficiency is more critical than ever. One of the key issues for long-sequence modeling using attention-based model is the mismatch between the limited-range modeling power of full attention and the long-range token dependency in the input sequence. In this work, we propose to scale up the attention receptive field by tensorizing long input sequences into compact tensor representations followed by attention on each transformed dimension. The resulting Tensorized Attention can be adopted as efficient transformer backbones to extend input context length with improved memory and time efficiency. We show that the proposed attention tensorization encodes token dependencies as a multi-hop attention process, and is equivalent to Kronecker decomposition of full attention. Extensive experiments show that tensorized attention can be used to adapt pretrained LLMs with improved efficiency. Notably, Llama-8B with tensorization is trained under 32,768 context length and can steadily extrapolate to 128k length during inference with $11\times$ speedup, compared to full attention with FlashAttention-2.

Abstract: We create two German-only decoder models, LL\"aMmlein 120M and 1B, transparently from scratch and publish them, along with the training data, for the German NLP research community to use. The model training involved several key steps, including extensive data preprocessing, the creation of a custom German tokenizer, the training itself, as well as the evaluation of the final models on various benchmarks. Throughout the training process, multiple checkpoints were saved and analyzed using the SuperGLEBer benchmark to monitor the models' learning dynamics. Compared to state-of-the-art models on the SuperGLEBer benchmark, both LL\"aMmlein models performed competitively, consistently matching or surpassing models with similar parameter sizes. The results show that the models' quality scales with size as expected, but performance improvements on some tasks plateaued early, offering valuable insights into resource allocation for future model development.

Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of Multi-modal Retrieval Augmented Multi-modal Generation (M$^2$RAG), a novel task that enables foundation models to process multi-modal web content and generate multi-modal responses, which exhibits better information density and readability. Despite its potential impact, M$^2$RAG remains understudied, lacking comprehensive analysis and high-quality data resources. To address this gap, we establish a comprehensive benchmark through a rigorous data curation pipeline, and employ text-modal metrics and multi-modal metrics based on foundation models for evaluation. We further propose several strategies for foundation models to process M$^2$RAG task effectively and construct a training set by filtering high-quality samples using our designed metrics. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the reliability of our proposed metrics, a landscape of model performance within our designed strategies, and show that our fine-tuned 7B-8B models outperform the GPT-4o model and approach the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3-mini. Additionally, we perform fine-grained analyses across diverse domains and validate the effectiveness of our designs in data curation pipeline. All resources, including codes, datasets, and model weights, will be publicly released.

Abstract: Low-rank adapters have become standard for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but they often fall short of achieving the performance of full fine-tuning. We propose a method, LoRA Silver Bullet or LoRA-SB, that approximates full fine-tuning within low-rank subspaces using a carefully designed initialization strategy. We theoretically demonstrate that the architecture of LoRA-XS, which inserts a learnable (r x r) matrix between B and A while keeping other matrices fixed, provides the precise conditions needed for this approximation. We leverage its constrained update space to achieve optimal scaling for high-rank gradient updates while removing the need for hyperparameter tuning. We prove that our initialization offers an optimal low-rank approximation of the initial gradient and preserves update directions throughout training. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding tasks demonstrate that our approach exceeds the performance of standard LoRA while using \textbf{27-90} times fewer learnable parameters, and comprehensively outperforms LoRA-XS. Our findings establish that it is possible to simulate full fine-tuning in low-rank subspaces, and achieve significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RaghavSinghal10/lora-sb.

Abstract: The editability of online news content has become a significant factor in shaping public perception, as social media platforms introduce new affordances for dynamic and adaptive news framing. Edits to news headlines can refocus audience attention, add or remove emotional language, and shift the framing of events in subtle yet impactful ways. What types of media bias are editorialized in and out of news headlines, and how can they be systematically identified? This study introduces the MediaSpin dataset, the first to characterize the bias in how prominent news outlets editorialize news headlines after publication. The dataset includes 78,910 pairs of headlines annotated with 13 distinct types of media bias, using human-supervised LLM labeling. We discuss the linguistic insights it affords and show its applications for bias prediction and user behavior analysis.

Abstract: Despite demonstrating impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) still often struggle to accurately express the factual knowledge they possess, especially in cases where the LLMs' knowledge boundaries are ambiguous. To improve LLMs' factual expressions, we propose the UAlign framework, which leverages Uncertainty estimations to represent knowledge boundaries, and then explicitly incorporates these representations as input features into prompts for LLMs to Align with factual knowledge. First, we prepare the dataset on knowledge question-answering (QA) samples by calculating two uncertainty estimations, including confidence score and semantic entropy, to represent the knowledge boundaries for LLMs. Subsequently, using the prepared dataset, we train a reward model that incorporates uncertainty estimations and then employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for factuality alignment on LLMs. Experimental results indicate that, by integrating uncertainty representations in LLM alignment, the proposed UAlign can significantly enhance the LLMs' capacities to confidently answer known questions and refuse unknown questions on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, showing reliability improvements and good generalizability over various prompt- and training-based baselines.

Abstract: Processing long contexts poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to their inherent context-window limitations and the computational burden of extensive key-value (KV) activations, which severely impact efficiency. For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is often unnecessary, as a query's information needs can dynamically range from localized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity. However, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to these dynamic information needs.
  In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context information-seeking tasks via query-guided Activation Refilling (ACRE). ACRE constructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache compactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides detailed and localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship between the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and dynamically refill it with relevant entries from the L2 cache. This mechanism integrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thus improving answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context information-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving improvements in both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user queries. These systems, however, remain susceptible to corpus poisoning attacks, which can severely impair the performance of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose TrustRAG, a robust framework that systematically filters malicious and irrelevant content before it is retrieved for generation. Our approach employs a two-stage defense mechanism. The first stage implements a cluster filtering strategy to detect potential attack patterns. The second stage employs a self-assessment process that harnesses the internal capabilities of LLMs to detect malicious documents and resolve inconsistencies. TrustRAG provides a plug-and-play, training-free module that integrates seamlessly with any open- or closed-source language model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrustRAG delivers substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and attack resistance.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have shown promise in enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Test-Time Scaling (TTS). However, their integration into multimodal reasoning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we take the first step toward unlocking the potential of PRMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning. We identify three key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality reasoning data constrains the capabilities of foundation Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which imposes further limitations on the upper bounds of TTS and reinforcement learning (RL); (2) a lack of automated methods for process labeling within multimodal contexts persists; (3) the employment of process rewards in unimodal RL faces issues like reward hacking, which may extend to multimodal scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce URSA, a three-stage Unfolding multimodal Process-Supervision Aided training framework. We first construct MMathCoT-1M, a high-quality large-scale multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning dataset, to build a stronger math reasoning foundation MLLM, URSA-8B. Subsequently, we go through an automatic process to synthesize process supervision data, which emphasizes both logical correctness and perceptual consistency. We introduce DualMath-1.1M to facilitate the training of URSA-8B-RM. Finally, we propose Process-Supervised Group-Relative-Policy-Optimization (PS-GRPO), pioneering a multimodal PRM-aided online RL method that outperforms vanilla GRPO.

Abstract: Existing methods for code generation use code snippets as seed data, restricting the complexity and diversity of the synthesized data. In this paper, we introduce a novel feature tree-based synthesis framework, which revolves around hierarchical code features derived from high-level abstractions of code. The feature tree is constructed from raw data and refined iteratively to increase the quantity and diversity of the extracted features, which captures and recognizes more complex patterns and relationships within the code. By adjusting the depth and breadth of the sampled subtrees, our framework provides precise control over the complexity of the generated code, enabling functionalities that range from function-level operations to multi-file scenarios. We fine-tuned widely-used base models to obtain EpiCoder series, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks at both the function and file levels. In particular, empirical evidence indicates that our approach shows significant potential in the synthesizing of repository-level code data. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/EpiCoder.

Abstract: Human bilinguals often use similar brain regions to process multiple languages, depending on when they learned their second language and their proficiency. In large language models (LLMs), how are multiple languages learned and encoded? In this work, we explore the extent to which LLMs share representations of morphsyntactic concepts such as grammatical number, gender, and tense across languages. We train sparse autoencoders on Llama-3-8B and Aya-23-8B, and demonstrate that abstract grammatical concepts are often encoded in feature directions shared across many languages. We use causal interventions to verify the multilingual nature of these representations; specifically, we show that ablating only multilingual features decreases classifier performance to near-chance across languages. We then use these features to precisely modify model behavior in a machine translation task; this demonstrates both the generality and selectivity of these feature's roles in the network. Our findings suggest that even models trained predominantly on English data can develop robust, cross-lingual abstractions of morphosyntactic concepts.

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is crucial for identifying spam, misinformation, and offensive language in natural language processing tasks. Despite the growing adoption of embedding-based methods, their effectiveness and generalizability across diverse application scenarios remain under-explored. To address this, we present TAD-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embedding-based approaches for text anomaly detection. TAD-Bench integrates multiple datasets spanning different domains, combining state-of-the-art embeddings from large language models with a variety of anomaly detection algorithms. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the interplay between embeddings and detection methods, uncovering their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to different tasks. These findings offer new perspectives on building more robust, efficient, and generalizable anomaly detection systems for real-world applications.

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental component of large language models (LLMs), yet its influence on model scaling and performance is not fully explored. In this paper, we introduce Over-Tokenized Transformers, a novel framework that decouples input and output vocabularies to improve language modeling performance. Specifically, our approach scales up input vocabularies to leverage multi-gram tokens. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a log-linear relationship between input vocabulary size and training loss, demonstrating that larger input vocabularies consistently enhance model performance, regardless of model size. Using a large input vocabulary, we achieve performance comparable to double-sized baselines with no additional cost. Our findings highlight the importance of tokenization in scaling laws and provide practical insight for tokenizer design, paving the way for more efficient and powerful LLMs.

<title>CopySpec: Accelerating LLMs with Speculative Copy-and-Paste Without Compromising Quality</title>

Abstract: We introduce CopySpec, a simple yet effective technique to tackle the inefficiencies LLMs face when generating responses that closely resemble previous outputs or responses that can be verbatim extracted from context. CopySpec identifies repeated sequences in the model's chat history or context and speculates that the same tokens will follow, enabling seamless copying without compromising output quality and without requiring additional GPU memory. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments using seven LLMs and five datasets: MT-Bench, CNN/DM, GSM8K, HumanEval, and our newly created dataset, MT-Redundant. MT-Redundant, introduced in this paper, transforms the second turn of MT-Bench into a request for variations of the first turn's answer, simulating real-world scenarios where users request modifications to prior responses. Our results demonstrate significant speed-ups: up to 2.35x on CNN/DM, 3.08x on the second turn of select MT-Redundant categories, and 2.66x on the third turn of GSM8K's self-correction tasks. Importantly, we show that CopySpec integrates seamlessly with speculative decoding, yielding an average 49% additional speed-up over speculative decoding for the second turn of MT-Redundant across all eight categories. While LLMs, even with speculative decoding, suffer from slower inference as context size grows, CopySpec leverages larger contexts to accelerate inference, making it a faster complementary solution. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/RazvanDu/CopySpec.

Abstract: Post-training pruning has emerged as a crucial optimization technique as large language models (LLMs) continue to grow rapidly. However, the significant variations in weight distributions across different LLMs make fixed pruning strategies inadequate for multiple models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{OptiShear}}, an efficient evolutionary optimization framework for adaptive LLM pruning. Our framework features two key innovations: an effective search space built on our Meta pruning metric to handle diverse weight distributions, and a model-wise reconstruction error for rapid evaluation during search trials. We employ Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) to optimize both pruning metrics and layerwise sparsity ratios. Through extensive evaluation on LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral models (7B-70B) across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our adaptive pruning metrics consistently outperform existing methods. Additionally, our discovered layerwise sparsity ratios enhance the effectiveness of other pruning metrics. The framework exhibits strong cross-task and cross-model generalizability, providing a cost-effective solution for model compression.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have led to specialized models excelling in specific domains, creating a need for efficient model merging techniques. While traditional merging approaches combine parameters into a single static model, they often compromise task-specific performance. However, task-specific routing methods maintain accuracy but introduce substantial storage overhead. We present \texttt{1bit}-Merging, a novel framework that integrates task-specific routing with 1-bit quantized task vectors to balance performance and storage efficiency. Our approach leverages the observation that different task-specific models store knowledge in distinct layers-chat models primarily in attention layers and math/code models in MLP layers, enabling targeted compression strategies. Through extensive experiments with LLaMA2 and Mistral model families across chat, mathematical reasoning, and code generation tasks, we demonstrate that 1bit-Merging achieves comparable or superior performance to existing methods while significantly reducing storage requirements. Our framework offers a practical solution for combining specialized models while maintaining their individual strengths and addressing the storage challenges of current approaches.

Abstract: While most current approaches rely on further training techniques, such as fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, to enhance model capacities, model merging stands out for its ability of improving models without requiring any additional training. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for model merging based on low-rank estimation of task vectors without the need for access to the base model, named \textsc{LoRE-Merging}. Our approach is motivated by the observation that task vectors from fine-tuned models frequently exhibit a limited number of dominant singular values, making low-rank estimations less prone to interference. We implement the method by formulating the merging problem as an optimization problem. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating interference and preserving task-specific information, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art performance in model merging techniques.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.

<title>Vendi-RAG: Adaptively Trading-Off Diversity And Quality Significantly Improves Retrieval Augmented Generation With LLMs</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific question-answering (QA) tasks by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG systems primarily focus on relevance-based retrieval and often struggle with redundancy, especially when reasoning requires connecting information from multiple sources. This paper introduces Vendi-RAG, a framework based on an iterative process that jointly optimizes retrieval diversity and answer quality. This joint optimization leads to significantly higher accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. Vendi-RAG leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to promote semantic diversity in document retrieval. It then uses an LLM judge that evaluates candidate answers, generated after a reasoning step, and outputs a score that the retriever uses to balance relevance and diversity among the retrieved documents during each iteration. Experiments on three challenging datasets -- HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA -- demonstrate Vendi-RAG's effectiveness in multi-hop reasoning tasks. The framework achieves significant accuracy improvements over traditional single-step and multi-step RAG approaches, with accuracy increases reaching up to +4.2% on HotpotQA, +4.1% on 2WikiMultiHopQA, and +1.3% on MuSiQue compared to Adaptive-RAG, the current best baseline. The benefits of Vendi-RAG are even more pronounced as the number of retrieved documents increases. Finally, we evaluated Vendi-RAG across different LLM backbones, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o-mini, and observed consistent improvements, demonstrating that the framework's advantages are model-agnostic.

Abstract: System messages play a crucial role in interactions with large language models (LLMs), often serving as prompts to initiate conversations. Through system messages, users can assign specific roles, perform intended tasks, incorporate background information, and specify various output formats and communication styles. Despite such versatility, publicly available datasets often lack system messages and are subject to strict license constraints in industrial applications. Moreover, manually annotating system messages that align with user instructions is resource-intensive. In light of these challenges, we introduce SysGen, a pipeline for generating system messages that better align assistant responses with user instructions using existing supervised fine-tuning datasets that lack system messages. Training open-source models on SysGen data yields substantial improvements in both single-turn (Multifacet) and multi-turn (SysBench) conversation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows strong gains in shorter conversations, suggesting that it enhances early-stage interaction effectiveness. Our qualitative analysis further emphasizes the value of diverse and structured system messages in improving LLM adaptability across varied user scenarios.

Abstract: Prior studies have shown that distinguishing text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-written one is highly challenging, and often no better than random guessing. To verify the generalizability of this finding across languages and domains, we perform an extensive case study to identify the upper bound of human detection accuracy. Across 16 datasets covering 9 languages and 9 domains, 19 annotators achieved an average detection accuracy of 87.6\%, thus challenging previous conclusions. We find that major gaps between human and machine text lie in concreteness, cultural nuances, and diversity. Prompting by explicitly explaining the distinctions in the prompts can partially bridge the gaps in over 50\% of the cases. However, we also find that humans do not always prefer human-written text, particularly when they cannot clearly identify its source.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a vital role in applications like conversational agents and content creation, where controlling a model's personality is crucial for maintaining tone, consistency, and engagement. However, traditional prompt-based techniques for controlling personality often fall short, as they do not effectively mitigate the model's inherent biases. In this paper, we introduce a novel method PALETTE that enhances personality control through knowledge editing. By generating adjustment queries inspired by psychological assessments, our approach systematically adjusts responses to personality-related queries similar to modifying factual knowledge, thereby achieving controlled shifts in personality traits. Experimental results from both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our method enables more stable and well-balanced personality control in LLMs.

Abstract: Model pruning is an effective approach for compressing large language models (LLMs). However, this process often leads to significant degradation of model capabilities. While post-training techniques such as instruction tuning are commonly employed to recover model performance, existing methods often overlook the uneven deterioration of model capabilities and incur high computational costs. Moreover, some irrelevant instructions may also introduce negative effects to model capacity recovery. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{P}ost-training d\textbf{A}ta \textbf{S}election method for \textbf{E}fficient pruned large language model \textbf{R}ecovery (\textbf{PASER}). PASER aims to identify instructions to recover the most compromised model capacities with a certain data budget. Our approach first applies manifold learning and spectral clustering to group recovery instructions in the semantic space, revealing capability-specific instruction sets. Then, the data budget is adaptively allocated across clusters by the degree of corresponding model capability degradation. In each cluster, we prioritize data samples that lead to the most decline of model performance. To mitigate potential negative tuning effects, we also detect and filter out conflicting or irrelevant recovery data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PASER significantly outperforms conventional baselines, effectively recovering the general capabilities of pruned LLMs while utilizing merely 4\%-20\% of the original post-training data. We provide the anonymous code repository in \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PASER-E606}{Link}.

Abstract: In LLM evaluations, reasoning is often distinguished from recall/memorization by performing numerical variations to math-oriented questions. Here we introduce a general variation method for multiple-choice questions that completely dissociates the correct answer from previously seen tokens or concepts, requiring LLMs to understand and reason (rather than memorizing) in order to answer correctly. Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and Spanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset. Results show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our proposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access 2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models. Notably, the most accurate model in our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust (DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may not be the ones with better reasoning capabilities. Also, we see larger accuracy drops in public (vs private) datasets and questions posed in their original language (vs a manual translation), which are signs of contamination and also point to a relevant role of recall/memorization in current LLMs' answers.

Abstract: We examine three evaluation paradigms: standard benchmarks (e.g., MMLU and BBH), interactive games (e.g., Signalling Games or Taboo), and cognitive tests (e.g., for working memory or theory of mind). First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models~(LLMs), which integrate external knowledge, have shown remarkable performance in medical domains, including clinical diagnosis. However, existing RAG methods often struggle to tailor retrieval strategies to diagnostic difficulty and input sample informativeness. This limitation leads to excessive and often unnecessary retrieval, impairing computational efficiency and increasing the risk of introducing noise that can degrade diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose ICA-RAG (\textbf{I}nformation \textbf{C}ompleteness Guided \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{G}eneration), a novel framework for enhancing RAG reliability in disease diagnosis. ICA-RAG utilizes an adaptive control module to assess the necessity of retrieval based on the input's information completeness. By optimizing retrieval and incorporating knowledge filtering, ICA-RAG better aligns retrieval operations with clinical requirements. Experiments on three Chinese electronic medical record datasets demonstrate that ICA-RAG significantly outperforms baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness in clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: Knowledge editing allows for efficient adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to new information or corrections without requiring full retraining. However, prior methods typically focus on either single-language editing or basic multilingual editing, failing to achieve true cross-linguistic knowledge synchronization. To address this, we present a simple and practical state-of-the-art (SOTA) recipe Cross-Lingual Knowledge Democracy Edit (X-KDE), designed to propagate knowledge from a dominant language to other languages effectively. Our X-KDE comprises two stages: (i) Cross-lingual Edition Instruction Tuning (XE-IT), which fine-tunes the model on a curated parallel dataset to modify in-scope knowledge while preserving unrelated information, and (ii) Target-language Preference Optimization (TL-PO), which applies advanced optimization techniques to ensure consistency across languages, fostering the transfer of updates. Additionally, we contribute a high-quality, cross-lingual dataset, specifically designed to enhance knowledge transfer across languages. Extensive experiments on the Bi-ZsRE and MzsRE benchmarks show that X-KDE significantly enhances cross-lingual performance, achieving an average improvement of +8.19%, while maintaining high accuracy in monolingual settings.

<title>SafeInt: Shielding Large Language Models from Jailbreak Attacks via Safety-Aware Representation Intervention</title>

Abstract: With the widespread real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their behavior complies with safety standards has become crucial. Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs to induce undesirable behavior, posing a significant threat to LLM safety. Previous defenses often fail to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Defenses from a representation perspective offer new insights, but existing interventions cannot dynamically adjust representations based on the harmfulness of the queries. To address this limitation, we propose SafeIntervention (SafeInt), a novel defense method that shields LLMs from jailbreak attacks through safety-aware representation intervention. Built on our analysis of the representations of jailbreak samples, the core idea of SafeInt is to relocate jailbreak-related representations into the rejection region. This is achieved by intervening in the representation distributions of jailbreak samples to align them with those of unsafe samples. We conduct comprehensive experiments covering six jailbreak attacks, two jailbreak datasets, and two utility benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SafeInt outperforms all baselines in defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks while largely maintaining utility. Additionally, we evaluate SafeInt against adaptive attacks and verify its effectiveness in mitigating real-time attacks.

Abstract: Visual programming languages (VPLs) allow users to create programs through graphical interfaces, which results in easier accessibility and their widespread usage in various domains. To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative large language models (LLMs) have enabled wider applicability, accessibility, and flexibility. However, their reliability and trustworthiness are still in doubt, especially for concerns regarding individuals' data privacy. Great efforts have been made on privacy by building various evaluation benchmarks to study LLMs' privacy awareness and robustness from their generated outputs to their hidden representations. Unfortunately, most of these works adopt a narrow formulation of privacy and only investigate personally identifiable information (PII). In this paper, we follow the merit of the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory, which posits that privacy evaluation should not only cover the transmitted attributes but also encompass the whole relevant social context through private information flows. We present PrivaCI-Bench, a comprehensive contextual privacy evaluation benchmark targeted at legal compliance to cover well-annotated privacy and safety regulations, real court cases, privacy policies, and synthetic data built from the official toolkit to study LLMs' privacy and safety compliance. We evaluate the latest LLMs, including the recent reasoner models QwQ-32B and Deepseek R1. Our experimental results suggest that though LLMs can effectively capture key CI parameters inside a given context, they still require further advancements for privacy compliance.

Abstract: Peer review underpins scientific progress, but it is increasingly strained by reviewer shortages and growing workloads. Large Language Models (LLMs) can automatically draft reviews now, but determining whether LLM-generated reviews are trustworthy requires systematic evaluation. Researchers have evaluated LLM reviews at either surface-level (e.g., BLEU and ROUGE) or content-level (e.g., specificity and factual accuracy). Yet it remains uncertain whether LLM-generated reviews attend to the same critical facets that human experts weigh -- the strengths and weaknesses that ultimately drive an accept-or-reject decision. We introduce a focus-level evaluation framework that operationalizes the focus as a normalized distribution of attention across predefined facets in paper reviews. Based on the framework, we developed an automatic focus-level evaluation pipeline based on two sets of facets: target (e.g., problem, method, and experiment) and aspect (e.g., validity, clarity, and novelty), leveraging 676 paper reviews (https://figshare.com/s/d5adf26c802527dd0f62) from OpenReview that consists of 3,657 strengths and weaknesses identified from human experts. The comparison of focus distributions between LLMs and human experts showed that the off-the-shelf LLMs consistently have a more biased focus towards examining technical validity while significantly overlooking novelty assessment when criticizing papers.

<title>Unveiling Downstream Performance Scaling of LLMs: A Clustering-Based Perspective</title>

Abstract: The escalating scale and cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) training necessitate accurate pre-training prediction of downstream task performance for efficient resource allocation. This is challenged by: 1) the emergence phenomenon, where metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, hindering prediction by smaller models; and 2) uneven task difficulty and inconsistent performance scaling patterns, leading to high metric variability. Current prediction methods lack accuracy and reliability. We propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) framework for downstream performance prediction. The COD framework clusters tasks by their difficulty scaling features, thereby establishing a more stable and predictable support subset through the exclusion of tasks exhibiting non-emergent behavior or irregular scaling. We adopt a performance scaling law to predict cluster-wise performance with theoretical support. Predictable subset performance acts as an intermediate predictor for the full evaluation set. We further derive a mapping function to accurately extrapolate the performance of the subset to the full set. Applied to an LLM with 70B parameters, COD achieved a 1.36% average prediction error across eight key LLM benchmarks, offering actionable insights for resource allocation and training monitoring of LLMs pretraining.

Abstract: Peer review is a critical process for ensuring the integrity of published scientific research. Confidence in this process is predicated on the assumption that experts in the relevant domain give careful consideration to the merits of manuscripts which are submitted for publication. With the recent rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), a new risk to the peer review process is that negligent reviewers will rely on LLMs to perform the often time consuming process of reviewing a paper. However, there is a lack of existing resources for benchmarking the detectability of AI text in the domain of peer review. To address this deficiency, we introduce a comprehensive dataset containing a total of 788,984 AI-written peer reviews paired with corresponding human reviews, covering 8 years of papers submitted to each of two leading AI research conferences (ICLR and NeurIPS). We use this new resource to evaluate the ability of 18 existing AI text detection algorithms to distinguish between peer reviews fully written by humans and different state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we explore a context-aware detection method called Anchor, which leverages manuscript content to detect AI-generated reviews, and analyze the sensitivity of detection models to LLM-assisted editing of human-written text. Our work reveals the difficulty of identifying AI-generated text at the individual peer review level, highlighting the urgent need for new tools and methods to detect this unethical use of generative AI. Our dataset is publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/IntelLabs/AI-Peer-Review-Detection-Benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) have demonstrated their efficacy in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing evaluation benchmarks often assume a single optimal approach to leveraging retrieved information, failing to account for varying user needs. This paper introduces a novel evaluation framework that systematically assesses RALMs under three user need cases-Context-Exclusive, Context-First, and Memory-First-across three distinct context settings: Context Matching, Knowledge Conflict, and Information Irrelevant. By varying both user instructions and the nature of retrieved information, our approach captures the complexities of real-world applications where models must adapt to diverse user requirements. Through extensive experiments on multiple QA datasets, including HotpotQA, DisentQA, and our newly constructed synthetic URAQ dataset, we find that restricting memory usage improves robustness in adversarial retrieval conditions but decreases peak performance with ideal retrieval results and model family dominates behavioral differences. Our findings highlight the necessity of user-centric evaluations in the development of retrieval-augmented systems and provide insights into optimizing model performance across varied retrieval contexts. We will release our code and URAQ dataset upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: An Achilles heel of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their tendency to hallucinate non-factual statements. A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.

<title>Rewarding Doubt: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Calibrated Confidence Expression of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: A safe and trustworthy use of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires an accurate expression of confidence in their answers. We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning approach that allows to directly fine-tune LLMs to express calibrated confidence estimates alongside their answers to factual questions. Our method optimizes a reward based on the logarithmic scoring rule, explicitly penalizing both over- and under-confidence. This encourages the model to align its confidence estimates with the actual predictive accuracy. The optimal policy under our reward design would result in perfectly calibrated confidence expressions. Unlike prior approaches that decouple confidence estimation from response generation, our method integrates confidence calibration seamlessly into the generative process of the LLM. Empirically, we demonstrate that models trained with our approach exhibit substantially improved calibration and generalize to unseen tasks without further fine-tuning, suggesting the emergence of general confidence awareness. We provide our training and evaluation code in the supplementary and will make it publicly available upon acceptance.

<title>SEOE: A Scalable and Reliable Semantic Evaluation Framework for Open Domain Event Detection</title>

Abstract: Automatic evaluation for Open Domain Event Detection (ODED) is a highly challenging task, because ODED is characterized by a vast diversity of un-constrained output labels from various domains. Nearly all existing evaluation methods for ODED usually first construct evaluation benchmarks with limited labels and domain coverage, and then evaluate ODED methods using metrics based on token-level label matching rules. However, this kind of evaluation framework faces two issues: (1) The limited evaluation benchmarks lack representatives of the real world, making it difficult to accurately reflect the performance of various ODED methods in real-world scenarios; (2) Evaluation metrics based on token-level matching rules fail to capture semantic similarity between predictions and golden labels. To address these two problems above, we propose a scalable and reliable Semantic-level Evaluation framework for Open domain Event detection (SEOE) by constructing a more representative evaluation benchmark and introducing a semantic evaluation metric. Specifically, our proposed framework first constructs a scalable evaluation benchmark that currently includes 564 event types covering 7 major domains, with a cost-effective supplementary annotation strategy to ensure the benchmark's representativeness. The strategy also allows for the supplement of new event types and domains in the future. Then, the proposed SEOE leverages large language models (LLMs) as automatic evaluation agents to compute a semantic F1-score, incorporating fine-grained definitions of semantically similar labels to enhance the reliability of the evaluation. Extensive experiments validate the representatives of the benchmark and the reliability of the semantic evaluation metric. Existing ODED methods are thoroughly evaluated, and the error patterns of predictions are analyzed, revealing several insightful findings.

Abstract: Causal reasoning and compositional reasoning are two core aspirations in AI. Measuring the extent of these behaviors requires principled evaluation methods. We explore a unified perspective that considers both behaviors simultaneously, termed compositional causal reasoning (CCR): the ability to infer how causal measures compose and, equivalently, how causal quantities propagate through graphs. We instantiate a framework for the systematic evaluation of CCR for the average treatment effect and the probability of necessity and sufficiency. As proof of concept, we demonstrate CCR evaluation for language models in the LLama, Phi, and GPT families. On a math word problem, our framework revealed a range of taxonomically distinct error patterns. CCR errors increased with the complexity of causal paths for all models except o1.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations, producing outputs that are contextually inaccurate or factually incorrect. We introduce HICD, a novel method designed to induce hallucinations for contrastive decoding to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing contrastive decoding methods, HICD selects attention heads crucial to the model's prediction as inducing heads, then induces hallucinations by dispersing attention of these inducing heads and compares the hallucinated outputs with the original outputs to obtain the final result. Our approach significantly improves performance on tasks requiring contextual faithfulness, such as context completion, reading comprehension, and question answering. It also improves factuality in tasks requiring accurate knowledge recall. We demonstrate that our inducing heads selection and attention dispersion method leads to more "contrast-effective" hallucinations for contrastive decoding, outperforming other hallucination-inducing methods. Our findings provide a promising strategy for reducing hallucinations by inducing hallucinations in a controlled manner, enhancing the performance of LLMs in a wide range of tasks.

Abstract: Despite recent success in applying large language models (LLMs) to electronic health records (EHR), most systems focus primarily on assessment rather than treatment planning. We identify three critical limitations in current approaches: they generate treatment plans in a single pass rather than following the sequential reasoning process used by clinicians; they rarely incorporate patient-specific historical context; and they fail to effectively distinguish between subjective and objective clinical information. Motivated by the SOAP methodology (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), we introduce \ours{}, a novel framework that structures LLM reasoning to align with real-life clinician workflows. Our approach employs a two-stage architecture that first generates a clinical assessment based on patient symptoms and objective data, then formulates a structured treatment plan informed by this assessment and enriched with patient-specific information through retrieval-augmented generation. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in both assessment accuracy and treatment plan quality.

Abstract: Accurately mapping medical procedure names from healthcare providers to standardized terminology used by insurance companies is a crucial yet complex task. Inconsistencies in naming conventions lead to missclasified procedures, causing administrative inefficiencies and insurance claim problems in private healthcare settings. Many companies still use human resources for manual mapping, while there is a clear opportunity for automation. This paper proposes a retrieval-based architecture leveraging sentence embeddings for medical name matching in the Romanian healthcare system. This challenge is significantly more difficult in underrepresented languages such as Romanian, where existing pretrained language models lack domain-specific adaptation to medical text. We evaluate multiple embedding models, including Romanian, multilingual, and medical-domain-specific representations, to identify the most effective solution for this task. Our findings contribute to the broader field of medical NLP for low-resource languages such as Romanian.

Abstract: The transition from System 1 to System 2 reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has marked significant advancements in handling complex tasks through deliberate, iterative thinking. However, this progress often comes at the cost of efficiency, as models tend to overthink, generating redundant reasoning steps without proportional improvements in output quality. Long-to-Short (L2S) reasoning has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, aiming to balance reasoning depth with practical efficiency. While existing approaches, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and prompt engineering, have shown potential, they are either computationally expensive or unstable. Model merging, on the other hand, offers a cost-effective and robust alternative by integrating the quick-thinking capabilities of System 1 models with the methodical reasoning of System 2 models. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study on model merging for L2S reasoning, exploring diverse methodologies, including task-vector-based, SVD-based, and activation-informed merging. Our experiments reveal that model merging can reduce average response length by up to 55% while preserving or even improving baseline performance. We also identify a strong correlation between model scale and merging efficacy with extensive evaluations on 1.5B/7B/14B/32B models. Furthermore, we investigate the merged model's ability to self-critique and self-correct, as well as its adaptive response length based on task complexity. Our findings highlight model merging as a highly efficient and effective paradigm for L2S reasoning, offering a practical solution to the overthinking problem while maintaining the robustness of System 2 reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in supporting decision-making applications, particularly as personal assistants in the financial, healthcare, and legal domains. While prompt engineering strategies have enhanced the capabilities of LLMs in decision-making, cognitive biases inherent to LLMs present significant challenges. Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norms or rationality in decision-making that can lead to the production of inaccurate outputs. Existing cognitive bias mitigation strategies assume that input prompts only contain one type of cognitive bias, limiting their effectiveness in more challenging scenarios involving multiple cognitive biases. To fill this gap, we propose a cognitive debiasing approach, self-adaptive cognitive debiasing (SACD), that enhances the reliability of LLMs by iteratively refining prompts. Our method follows three sequential steps -- bias determination, bias analysis, and cognitive debiasing -- to iteratively mitigate potential cognitive biases in prompts. Experimental results on finance, healthcare, and legal decision-making tasks, using both closed-source and open-source LLMs, demonstrate that the proposed SACD method outperforms both advanced prompt engineering methods and existing cognitive debiasing techniques in average accuracy under single-bias and multi-bias settings.

Abstract: Finding evidence for human opinion and behavior at scale is a challenging task, often requiring an understanding of sophisticated thought patterns among vast online communities found on social media. For example, studying how gun ownership is related to the perception of Freedom, requires a retrieval system that can operate at scale over social media posts, while dealing with two key challenges: (1) identifying abstract concept instances, (2) which can be instantiated differently across different communities. To address these, we introduce ConceptCarve, an evidence retrieval framework that utilizes traditional retrievers and LLMs to dynamically characterize the search space during retrieval. Our experiments show that ConceptCarve surpasses traditional retrieval systems in finding evidence within a social media community. It also produces an interpretable representation of the evidence for that community, which we use to qualitatively analyze complex thought patterns that manifest differently across the communities.

Abstract: Interaction between learner and feedback-giver has come into focus recently for post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs), through the use of reward models that judge the appropriateness of a model's response. In this paper, we investigate whether Dialogue Games -- goal-directed and rule-governed activities driven predominantly by verbal actions -- can also serve as a source of feedback signals for learning. We introduce Playpen, an environment for off- and online learning through Dialogue Game self-play, and investigate a representative set of post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning; direct alignment (DPO); and reinforcement learning with GRPO. We experiment with post-training a small LLM (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), evaluating performance on unseen instances of training games as well as unseen games, and on standard benchmarks. We find that imitation learning through SFT improves performance on unseen instances, but negatively impacts other skills, while interactive learning with GRPO shows balanced improvements without loss of skills. We release the framework and the baseline training setups to foster research in the promising new direction of learning in (synthetic) interaction.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies indicate that current large language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them during inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. However, due to the diversity of dataset biases and the insufficient nature of bias suppression based on in-context learning, the effectiveness of previous prior knowledge-based debiasing methods and in-context learning based automatic debiasing methods is limited. To address these challenges, we explore the combination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an information gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (ICD) framework. To eliminate biases within the instruction-tuning dataset, it is essential to ensure that these biases do not provide any additional information to predict the answers, i.e., the information gain of these biases for predicting the answers needs to be 0. Under this guidance, this framework utilizes a causal intervention-based data rewriting method to automatically and autonomously balance the distribution of instruction-tuning dataset for reducing the information gain. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised fine-tuning process to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results show that ICD can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability across different tasks.

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual, organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

As data grows, expanding taxonomies is essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We propose LORex ($\textbf{L}$ineage-$\textbf{O}$riented $\textbf{Re}$asoning for Taxonomy E$\textbf{x}$pansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Explaining Black-box Model Predictions via Two-level Nested Feature Attributions with Consistency Property</title>

Abstract: Techniques that explain the predictions of black-box machine learning models are crucial to make the models transparent, thereby increasing trust in AI systems. The input features to the models often have a nested structure that consists of high- and low-level features, and each high-level feature is decomposed into multiple low-level features. For such inputs, both high-level feature attributions (HiFAs) and low-level feature attributions (LoFAs) are important for better understanding the model's decision. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic local explanation method that effectively exploits the nested structure of the input to estimate the two-level feature attributions simultaneously. A key idea of the proposed method is to introduce the consistency property that should exist between the HiFAs and LoFAs, thereby bridging the separate optimization problems for estimating them. Thanks to this consistency property, the proposed method can produce HiFAs and LoFAs that are both faithful to the black-box models and consistent with each other, using a smaller number of queries to the models. In experiments on image classification in multiple instance learning and text classification using language models, we demonstrate that the HiFAs and LoFAs estimated by the proposed method are accurate, faithful to the behaviors of the black-box models, and provide consistent explanations.

<title>Tracing Representation Progression: Analyzing and Enhancing Layer-Wise Similarity</title>

Abstract: Analyzing the similarity of internal representations has been an important technique for understanding the behavior of deep neural networks. Most existing methods for analyzing the similarity between representations of high dimensions, such as those based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), rely on statistical properties of the representations for a set of data points. In this paper, we focus on transformer models and study the similarity of representations between the hidden layers of individual transformers. In this context, we show that a simple sample-wise cosine similarity metric is capable of capturing the similarity and aligns with the complicated CKA. Our experimental results on common transformers reveal that representations across layers are positively correlated, with similarity increasing when layers get closer. We provide a theoretical justification for this phenomenon under the geodesic curve assumption for the learned transformer. We then show that an increase in representation similarity implies an increase in predicted probability when directly applying the last-layer classifier to any hidden layer representation. We then propose an aligned training method to improve the effectiveness of shallow layer by enhancing the similarity between internal representations, with trained models that enjoy the following properties: (1) more early saturation events, (2) layer-wise accuracies monotonically increase and reveal the minimal depth needed for the given task, (3) when served as multi-exit models, they achieve on-par performance with standard multi-exit architectures which consist of additional classifiers designed for early exiting in shallow layers. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show that one common classifier is sufficient for multi-exit models. We conduct experiments on both vision and NLP tasks to demonstrate the performance of the proposed aligned training.

<title>Fundamental Limitations on Subquadratic Alternatives to Transformers</title>

Abstract: The Transformer architecture is widely deployed in many popular and impactful Large Language Models. At its core is the attention mechanism for calculating correlations between pairs of tokens. Performing an attention computation takes quadratic time in the input size, and had become the time bottleneck for transformer operations. In order to circumvent this, researchers have used a variety of approaches, including designing heuristic algorithms for performing attention computations faster, and proposing alternatives to the attention mechanism which can be computed more quickly. For instance, state space models such as Mamba were designed to replace attention with an almost linear time alternative.
  In this paper, we prove that any such approach cannot perform important tasks that Transformer is able to perform (assuming a popular conjecture from fine-grained complexity theory). We focus on document similarity tasks, where one is given as input many documents and would like to find a pair which is (approximately) the most similar. We prove that Transformer is able to perform this task, and we prove that this task cannot be performed in truly subquadratic time by any algorithm. Thus, any model which can be evaluated in subquadratic time - whether because of subquadratic-time heuristics for attention, faster attention replacements like Mamba, or any other reason - cannot perform this task. In other words, in order to perform tasks that (implicitly or explicitly) involve document similarity, one may as well use Transformer and cannot avoid its quadratic running time.

Abstract: Integrating tools into Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated the widespread application. Despite this, in specialized downstream task contexts, reliance solely on tools is insufficient to fully address the complexities of the real world. This particularly restricts the effective deployment of LLMs in fields such as medicine. In this paper, we focus on the downstream tasks of medical calculators, which use standardized tests to assess an individual's health status. We introduce MeNTi, a universal agent architecture for LLMs. MeNTi integrates a specialized medical toolkit and employs meta-tool and nested calling mechanisms to enhance LLM tool utilization. Specifically, it achieves flexible tool selection and nested tool calling to address practical issues faced in intricate medical scenarios, including calculator selection, slot filling, and unit conversion. To assess the capabilities of LLMs for quantitative assessment throughout the clinical process of calculator scenarios, we introduce CalcQA. This benchmark requires LLMs to use medical calculators to perform calculations and assess patient health status. CalcQA is constructed by professional physicians and includes 100 case-calculator pairs, complemented by a toolkit of 281 medical tools. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements with our framework. This research paves new directions for applying LLMs in demanding scenarios of medicine.

Abstract: Advancing planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the key prerequisites towards unlocking their potential for performing reliably in complex and impactful domains. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate this across board games (Chess, Fischer Random / Chess960, Connect Four, and Hex), and we show that search-based planning can yield significant improvements in LLM game-playing strength. We introduce, compare and contrast two major approaches: In external search, the model guides Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts and evaluations without calls to an external game engine, and in internal search, the model is trained to generate in-context a linearized tree of search and a resulting final choice. Both build on a language model pre-trained on relevant domain knowledge, reliably capturing the transition and value functions in the respective environments, with minimal hallucinations. We evaluate our LLM search implementations against game-specific state-of-the-art engines, showcasing substantial improvements in strength over the base model, and reaching Grandmaster-level performance in chess while operating closer to the human search budget. Our proposed approach, combining search with domain knowledge, is not specific to board games, hinting at more general future applications.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly important, as it eliminates reliance on network connections, reduces expensive API calls, and enhances user privacy. However, on-device deployment is challenging due to the limited computational resources of edge devices. In particular, the key bottleneck stems from memory bandwidth constraints related to weight loading. Weight-only quantization effectively reduces memory access, yet often induces significant accuracy degradation. Recent efforts to incorporate sub-branches have shown promise for mitigating quantization errors, but these methods either lack robust optimization strategies or rely on suboptimal objectives. To address these gaps, we propose FeedBack Quantization (FBQuant), a novel approach inspired by negative feedback mechanisms in automatic control. FBQuant inherently ensures that the reconstructed weights remain bounded by the quantization process, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. To further offset the additional latency introduced by sub-branches, we develop an efficient CUDA kernel that decreases 60% of extra inference time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of FBQuant across various LLMs. Notably, for 3-bit Llama2-7B, FBQuant improves zero-shot accuracy by 1.2%.

<title>Optimizing Large Language Model Training Using FP4 Quantization</title>

arXiv:2501.17116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing computational demands of training large language models (LLMs) necessitate more efficient methods. Quantized training presents a promising solution by enabling low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce these costs. While FP8 precision has demonstrated feasibility, leveraging FP4 remains a challenge due to significant quantization errors and limited representational capacity. This work introduces the first FP4 training framework for LLMs, addressing these challenges with two key innovations: a differentiable quantization estimator for precise weight updates and an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to prevent activation collapse. To ensure stability, the framework integrates a mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to 13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens. With the emergence of next-generation hardware supporting FP4, our framework sets a foundation for efficient ultra-low precision training.

arXiv:2501.18511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model (LLM) post-training, from DPO to distillation, can refine behaviors and unlock new skills, but the open science supporting these post-training techniques is still in its infancy. One limiting factor has been the difficulty of conducting large-scale comparative analyses of synthetic data generating models and LLM judges. To close this gap, we introduce WILDCHAT-50M, the largest public chat dataset to date. We extend the existing WildChat dataset to include responses not only from GPT, but from over 50 different open-weight models, ranging in size from 0.5B to 104B parameters. We conduct an extensive comparative analysis and demonstrate the potential of this dataset by creating RE-WILD, our own public SFT mix, which outperforms the recent Tulu-3 SFT mixture from Allen AI with only 40% as many samples. Our dataset, samples and code are available at https://github.com/penfever/wildchat-50m.

arXiv:2501.18533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their deployment in safety-critical domains poses significant challenges. Existing safety fine-tuning methods, which focus on textual or multimodal content, fall short in addressing challenging cases or disrupt the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness. Our evaluation highlights a safety reasoning gap: these methods lack safety visual reasoning ability, leading to such bottlenecks. To address this limitation and enhance both visual perception and reasoning in safety-critical contexts, we propose a novel dataset that integrates multi-image inputs with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels as fine-grained reasoning logic to improve model performance. Specifically, we introduce the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, an instruction-following dataset tailored for multi-image safety scenarios, consisting of training and test splits. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B with MIS significantly outperforms both powerful open-source models and API-based models in challenging multi-image tasks requiring safety-related visual reasoning. This approach not only delivers exceptional safety performance but also preserves general capabilities without any trade-offs. Specifically, fine-tuning with MIS increases average accuracy by 0.83% across five general benchmarks and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) on multiple safety benchmarks by a large margin.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation. However, existing parallel scaling methods, such as repeated sampling or reward model scoring, often suffer from premature convergence and high costs due to task-specific reward model training, while sequential methods like SELF-REFINE cannot effectively leverage increased compute. This paper introduces Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a new approach that overcomes these limitations by strategically combining parallel and sequential techniques. SETS exploits the inherent self-verification and self-correction capabilities of LLMs, unifying sampling, verification, and correction within a single framework. This innovative design facilitates efficient and scalable test-time computation for enhanced performance on complex tasks. Our comprehensive experimental results on challenging benchmarks spanning planning, reasoning, math, and coding demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more advantageous test-time scaling behavior than the alternatives.

<title>Fairness through Difference Awareness: Measuring Desired Group Discrimination in LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.01926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has conventionally adopted the mathematically convenient perspective of racial color-blindness (i.e., difference unaware treatment). However, we contend that in a range of important settings, group difference awareness matters. For example, differentiating between groups may be necessary in legal contexts (e.g., the U.S. compulsory draft applies to men but not women) and harm assessments (e.g., referring to girls as ``terrorists'' may be less harmful than referring to Muslim people as such). Thus, in contrast to most fairness work, we study fairness through the perspective of treating people differently -- when it is contextually appropriate to. We first introduce an important distinction between descriptive (fact-based), normative (value-based), and correlation (association-based) benchmarks. This distinction is significant because each category requires separate interpretation and mitigation tailored to its specific characteristics. Then, we present a benchmark suite composed of eight different scenarios for a total of 16k questions that enables us to assess difference awareness. Finally, we show results across ten models that demonstrate difference awareness is a distinct dimension to fairness where existing bias mitigation strategies may backfire.

<title>Towards Copyright Protection for Knowledge Bases of Retrieval-augmented Language Models via Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2502.10440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world personalized applications through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanisms to supplement their responses with domain-specific knowledge. However, the valuable and often proprietary nature of the knowledge bases used in RAG introduces the risk of unauthorized usage by adversaries. Existing methods that can be generalized as watermarking techniques to protect these knowledge bases typically involve poisoning or backdoor attacks. However, these methods require altering the LLM's results of verification samples, inevitably making these watermarks susceptible to anomaly detection and even introducing new security risks. To address these challenges, we propose \name{} for `harmless' copyright protection of knowledge bases. Instead of manipulating LLM's final output, \name{} implants distinct yet benign verification behaviors in the space of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, maintaining the correctness of the final answer. Our method has three main stages: (1) Generating CoTs: For each verification question, we generate two `innocent' CoTs, including a target CoT for building watermark behaviors; (2) Optimizing Watermark Phrases and Target CoTs: Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we optimize them to minimize retrieval errors under the \emph{black-box} and \emph{text-only} setting of suspicious LLM, ensuring that only watermarked verification queries can retrieve their correspondingly target CoTs contained in the knowledge base; (3) Ownership Verification: We exploit a pairwise Wilcoxon test to verify whether a suspicious LLM is augmented with the protected knowledge base by comparing its responses to watermarked and benign verification queries. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that \name{} effectively protects knowledge bases and its resistance to adaptive attacks.

arXiv:2502.11799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in various reasoning tasks, they still struggle with table reasoning tasks, particularly in maintaining consistency throughout multi-step reasoning processes. While existing approaches have explored various decomposition strategies, they often lack effective mechanisms to identify and correct errors in intermediate reasoning steps, leading to cascading error propagation. To address these issues, we propose Table-Critic, a novel multi-agent framework that facilitates collaborative criticism and iterative refinement of the reasoning process until convergence to correct solutions. Our framework consists of four specialized agents: a Judge for error identification, a Critic for comprehensive critiques, a Refiner for process improvement, and a Curator for pattern distillation. To effectively deal with diverse and unpredictable error types, we introduce a self-evolving template tree that systematically accumulates critique knowledge through experience-driven learning and guides future reflections. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that Table-Critic achieves substantial improvements over existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and error correction rates while maintaining computational efficiency and lower solution degradation rate.

Abstract: Automata-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) has given promising results for learning multi-task policies capable of performing temporally extended objectives given at runtime, done by pretraining and freezing automata embeddings prior to training the downstream policy. However, no theoretical guarantees were given. This work provides a theoretical framework for the automata-conditioned RL problem and shows that it is probably approximately correct learnable. We then present a technique for learning provably correct automata embeddings, guaranteeing optimal multi-task policy learning. Our experimental evaluation confirms these theoretical results.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into information retrieval systems introduces new attack surfaces, particularly for adversarial ranking manipulations. We present $\textbf{StealthRank}$, a novel adversarial attack method that manipulates LLM-driven ranking systems while maintaining textual fluency and stealth. Unlike existing methods that often introduce detectable anomalies, StealthRank employs an energy-based optimization framework combined with Langevin dynamics to generate StealthRank Prompts (SRPs)-adversarial text sequences embedded within item or document descriptions that subtly yet effectively influence LLM ranking mechanisms. We evaluate StealthRank across multiple LLMs, demonstrating its ability to covertly boost the ranking of target items while avoiding explicit manipulation traces. Our results show that StealthRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial ranking baselines in both effectiveness and stealth, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in LLM-driven ranking systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the LLM instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's memory in the concurrent KV cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's memory. Hogwild! Inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: In the previous article, we presented a quantum-inspired framework for modeling semantic representation and processing in Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing upon mathematical tools and conceptual analogies from quantum mechanics to offer a new perspective on these complex systems. In this paper, we clarify the core assumptions of this model, providing a detailed exposition of six key principles that govern semantic representation, interaction, and dynamics within LLMs. The goal is to justify that a quantum-inspired framework is a valid approach to studying semantic spaces. This framework offers valuable insights into their information processing and response generation, and we further discuss the potential of leveraging quantum computing to develop significantly more powerful and efficient LLMs based on these principles.

<title>X-Transfer Attacks: Towards Super Transferable Adversarial Attacks on CLIP</title>

arXiv:2505.05528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are increasingly adopted for diverse downstream tasks and integrated into large vision-language models (VLMs), their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations has emerged as a critical concern. In this work, we introduce \textbf{X-Transfer}, a novel attack method that exposes a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP. X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of deceiving various CLIP encoders and downstream VLMs across different samples, tasks, and domains. We refer to this property as \textbf{super transferability}--a single perturbation achieving cross-data, cross-domain, cross-model, and cross-task adversarial transferability simultaneously. This is achieved through \textbf{surrogate scaling}, a key innovation of our approach. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed surrogate models, which are computationally intensive to scale, X-Transfer employs an efficient surrogate scaling strategy that dynamically selects a small subset of suitable surrogates from a large search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that X-Transfer significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art UAP methods, establishing a new benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/HanxunH/XTransferBench}{GitHub repository}.

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models demonstrate exceptional performance on various tasks. However, reasoning models inefficiently over-process both trivial and complex queries, leading to resource waste and prolonged user latency. To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a self-adaptive controllable reasoning strategy for efficient reasoning. Our approach adopts a dual-phase training paradigm: first, the model learns to pre-estimate the reasoning cost based on the difficulty of the query. Then, we introduce budget-guided GPRO for reinforcement learning, which effectively maintains accuracy while reducing output length. SelfBudgeter allows users to anticipate generation time and make informed decisions about continuing or interrupting the process. Furthermore, our method enables direct manipulation of reasoning length via pre-filling token budget. Experimental results demonstrate that SelfBudgeter can rationally allocate budgets according to problem complexity, achieving up to 74.47% response length compression on the MATH benchmark while maintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical for responsible deployment, yet existing evaluations often prioritize performance over identifying failure modes. We introduce Phare, a multilingual diagnostic framework to probe and evaluate LLM behavior across three critical dimensions: hallucination and reliability, social biases, and harmful content generation. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals patterns of systematic vulnerabilities across all safety dimensions, including sycophancy, prompt sensitivity, and stereotype reproduction. By highlighting these specific failure modes rather than simply ranking models, Phare provides researchers and practitioners with actionable insights to build more robust, aligned, and trustworthy language systems.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding distances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary. Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the best-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/GEM-OODforGUIagents.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation. Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks, conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications requires robust safety guard models to detect and block harmful user prompts. While large safety guard models are effective, their high computational cost poses a challenge. To address this issue, smaller distilled models are used, but they may struggle with complex examples where the larger model excels. The proposed SafeRoute approach offers a solution by using a binary router to identify difficult examples that require the larger model's capacity. By selectively applying the larger model to challenging data, SafeRoute improves efficiency without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that this adaptive model selection strategy enhances the balance between computational cost and safety performance, surpassing existing approaches. <div>

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications requires robust safety guard models to detect and block harmful user prompts. While large safety guard models achieve strong performance, their computational cost is substantial. To mitigate this, smaller distilled models are used, but they often underperform on "hard" examples where the larger model provides accurate predictions. We observe that many inputs can be reliably handled by the smaller model, while only a small fraction require the larger model's capacity. Motivated by this, we propose SafeRoute, a binary router that distinguishes hard examples from easy ones. Our method selectively applies the larger safety guard model to the data that the router considers hard, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy compared to solely using the larger safety guard model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our adaptive model selection significantly enhances the trade-off between computational cost and safety performance, outperforming relevant baselines.

Summary:
IPOMP is proposed as an automated prompt optimization technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve performance through representative and diverse sample selection using semantic clustering and boundary analysis. It addresses the limitations of existing coreset selection methods by incorporating real-time model performance data for iterative refinement, resulting in enhanced effectiveness and stability compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Evaluations on the BIG-bench dataset demonstrate effectiveness improvements of 1.6% to 5.3% and stability enhancements of at least 57% with minimal computational overhead. The real-time performance-guided refinement approach of IPOMP can be universally applied to enhance existing coreset selection methods for prompt optimization. <div>

Abstract: Optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) performance requires well-crafted prompts, but manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and often ineffective. Automated prompt optimization techniques address this challenge but the majority of them rely on randomly selected evaluation subsets, which fail to represent the full dataset, leading to unreliable evaluations and suboptimal prompts. Existing coreset selection methods, designed for LLM benchmarking, are unsuitable for prompt optimization due to challenges in clustering similar samples, high data collection costs, and the unavailability of performance data for new or private datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose IPOMP, an Iterative evaluation data selection for effective Prompt Optimization using real-time Model Performance. IPOMP is a two-stage approach that selects representative and diverse samples using semantic clustering and boundary analysis, followed by iterative refinement with real-time model performance data to replace redundant samples. Evaluations on the BIG-bench dataset show that IPOMP improves effectiveness by 1.6% to 5.3% and stability by at least 57% compared with SOTA baselines, with minimal computational overhead below 1%. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that our real-time performance-guided refinement approach can be universally applied to enhance existing coreset selection methods.

Summary:
ToolSpectrum is a benchmark created to evaluate the personalized tool utilization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on two key dimensions of personalization: user profile and environmental factors, and explores how they impact tool utilization. The benchmark experiments show that personalized tool utilization enhances user experience in various scenarios. However, even advanced LLMs struggle to effectively reason about both user profiles and environmental factors, often prioritizing one over the other. This highlights the importance of context-aware personalization in tool-augmented LLMs and reveals significant limitations in current models. The data and code for ToolSpectrum are available on GitHub for further exploration and research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.13176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While integrating external tools into large language models (LLMs) enhances their ability to access real-time information and domain-specific services, existing approaches focus narrowly on functional tool selection following user instructions, overlooking the context-aware personalization in tool selection. This oversight leads to suboptimal user satisfaction and inefficient tool utilization, particularly when overlapping toolsets require nuanced selection based on contextual factors. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolSpectrum, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in personalized tool utilization. Specifically, we formalize two key dimensions of personalization, user profile and environmental factors, and analyze their individual and synergistic impacts on tool utilization. Through extensive experiments on ToolSpectrum, we demonstrate that personalized tool utilization significantly improves user experience across diverse scenarios. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit the limited ability to reason jointly about user profiles and environmental factors, often prioritizing one dimension at the expense of the other. Our findings underscore the necessity of context-aware personalization in tool-augmented LLMs and reveal critical limitations for current models.

Summary: 
This study examines the role of language in representing subjective expectations when quantification of future payoffs is difficult or undesirable. The researchers find that analysts convey useful information through linguistic expressions in their reports, which is not captured in numerical forecasts. The textual tone of analyst reports is predictive of forecast errors and subsequent revisions, particularly when the language is vaguer, uncertainty is higher, and analysts are busier. The study suggests that valuable information that is vaguely known is communicated through language. This highlights the importance of considering linguistic cues alongside numerical data in understanding subjective expectations and forecast accuracy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.12269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less known-role in representing subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.

Summary: 
BR-TaxQA-R is a new dataset focusing on question answering in the field of Brazilian personal income tax law. It consists of 715 questions sourced from official documents, enriched with legal norms and rulings. The dataset is utilized in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline employing OpenAI embeddings for search and GPT-4o-mini for answer generation. Text segmentation strategies are compared, and the system performance is benchmarked against commercial tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai using RAGAS-based metrics. The results indicate that the custom RAG pipeline excels in Response Relevancy, aligning better with user queries, while the commercial models score higher in Factual Correctness and fluency. This suggests a trade-off between legally accurate answers and linguistic fluency.

Abstract: This paper presents BR-TaxQA-R, a novel dataset designed to support question answering with references in the context of Brazilian personal income tax law. The dataset contains 715 questions from the 2024 official Q\&amp;A document published by Brazil's Internal Revenue Service, enriched with statutory norms and administrative rulings from the Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais (CARF). We implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using OpenAI embeddings for searching and GPT-4o-mini for answer generation. We compare different text segmentation strategies and benchmark our system against commercial tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai using RAGAS-based metrics. Results show that our custom RAG pipeline outperforms commercial systems in Response Relevancy, indicating stronger alignment with user queries, while commercial models achieve higher scores in Factual Correctness and fluency. These findings highlight a trade-off between legally grounded generation and linguistic fluency. Crucially, we argue that human expert evaluation remains essential to ensure the legal validity of AI-generated answers in high-stakes domains such as taxation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as factual knowledge bases; however, their capability to generate probabilistic knowledge about real-world events remains understudied. This paper investigates using probabilistic knowledge inherent in LLMs to derive probability estimates for statements concerning events and their interrelationships captured via a Bayesian Network (BN). Using LLMs in this context allows for the parameterization of BNs, enabling probabilistic modeling within specific domains. Experiments on eighty publicly available Bayesian Networks, from healthcare to finance, demonstrate that querying LLMs about the conditional probabilities of events provides meaningful results when compared to baselines, including random and uniform distributions, as well as approaches based on next-token generation probabilities. We explore how these LLM-derived distributions can serve as expert priors to refine distributions extracted from minimal data, significantly reducing systematic biases. Overall, this work introduces a promising strategy for automatically constructing Bayesian Networks by combining probabilistic knowledge extracted from LLMs with small amounts of real-world data. Additionally, we evaluate several prompting strategies for eliciting probabilistic knowledge from LLMs and establish the first comprehensive baseline for assessing LLM performance in extracting probabilistic knowledge.

Summary: 
The article introduces a reward decomposition framework for aligning dialogue agents using a large language model (LLM). The framework leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities to infer fine-grained local rewards by decomposing global session-level feedback. The proposed models include a text-only variant where the LLM analyzes dialogue transcripts and a multimodal variant that incorporates behavioral cues such as pitch and facial affect expressed as natural language descriptions. These inferred turn-level rewards are used to fine-tune dialogue generation through reinforcement learning. The study compares the text-only and multimodal variants with existing reward decomposition methods and shows significant improvements in human evaluations of conversation quality. The results indicate that LLMs are effective reward decomposers, eliminating the need for manual reward shaping and detailed human feedback. <div>
arXiv:2505.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a large language model based reward decomposition framework for aligning dialogue agents using only a single session-level feedback signal. We leverage the reasoning capabilities of a frozen, pretrained large language model (LLM) to infer fine-grained local implicit rewards by decomposing global, session-level feedback. Our first text-only variant prompts the LLM to perform reward decomposition using only the dialogue transcript. The second multimodal variant incorporates additional behavioral cues, such as pitch, gaze, and facial affect, expressed as natural language descriptions. These inferred turn-level rewards are distilled into a lightweight reward model, which we utilize for RL-based fine-tuning for dialogue generation. We evaluate both text-only and multimodal variants against state-of-the-art reward decomposition methods and demonstrate notable improvements in human evaluations of conversation quality, suggesting that LLMs are strong reward decomposers that obviate the need for manual reward shaping and granular human feedback.

Summary: 
- The article highlights the need for a tool to support journals in understanding how knowledge circulates globally to address inequalities in knowledge production and dissemination.
- The absence of such a tool has led to a lack of information on networks of knowledge sharing in the Global South, resulting in the exclusion of researchers from indexing services.
- The study investigates the use of open-weight language models to annotate manuscript citations in an indexable format.
- Evaluations show that even basic language models can accurately identify components of citations, outperforming existing methods.
- The findings suggest that post-training these models could lead to the development of small, robust citation parsing models that can improve research indexing, discovery, and metascientific research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.15948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key type of resource needed to address global inequalities in knowledge production and dissemination is a tool that can support journals in understanding how knowledge circulates. The absence of such a tool has resulted in comparatively less information about networks of knowledge sharing in the Global South. In turn, this gap authorizes the exclusion of researchers and scholars from the South in indexing services, reinforcing colonial arrangements that de-center and minoritize those scholars. In order to support citation network tracking on a global scale, we investigate the capacity of open-weight language models to mark up manuscript citations in an indexable format. We assembled a dataset of matched plaintext and annotated citations from preprints and published research papers. Then, we evaluated a number of open-weight language models on the annotation task. We find that, even out of the box, today's language models achieve high levels of accuracy on identifying the constituent components of each citation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the smallest model we evaluated, Qwen3-0.6B, can parse all fields with high accuracy in $2^5$ passes, suggesting that post-training is likely to be effective in producing small, robust citation parsing models. Such a tool could greatly improve the fidelity of citation networks and thus meaningfully improve research indexing and discovery, as well as further metascientific research.

Summary:
Process Reward Models (PRMs) are gaining attention for providing feedback on reasoning by Large Language Models (LLMs). Two challenges are accurate step-level error labeling and PRMs limited to math problems. This paper introduces FoVer, which uses formal verification tools for automatic step-level error labeling on LLM responses for formal logic and theorem proof tasks. The synthesized dataset enables training PRMs without human annotation, leading to improved verification on diverse reasoning tasks. Results show cross-task generalization with FoVer-trained PRMs outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks. The FoVer dataset, models, and code are publicly available. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- PRMs provide feedback on LLM reasoning

- FoVer uses formal verification tools for automatic error labeling
- Synthesized dataset allows training PRMs without human annotation
- Cross-task generalization observed with improved verification performance <div>
arXiv:2505.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs), which provide step-by-step feedback on the reasoning generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), are receiving increasing attention. However, two key research gaps remain: collecting accurate step-level error labels for training typically requires costly human annotation, and existing PRMs are limited to math reasoning problems. In response to these gaps, this paper aims to address the challenges of automatic dataset creation and the generalization of PRMs to diverse reasoning tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose FoVer, an approach for training PRMs on step-level error labels automatically annotated by formal verification tools, such as Z3 for formal logic and Isabelle for theorem proof, which provide automatic and accurate verification for symbolic tasks. Using this approach, we synthesize a training dataset with error labels on LLM responses for formal logic and theorem proof tasks without human annotation. Although this data synthesis is feasible only for tasks compatible with formal verification, we observe that LLM-based PRMs trained on our dataset exhibit cross-task generalization, improving verification across diverse reasoning tasks. Specifically, PRMs trained with FoVer significantly outperform baseline PRMs based on the original LLMs and achieve competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art PRMs trained on labels annotated by humans or stronger models, as measured by step-level verification on ProcessBench and Best-of-K performance across 12 reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME, ANLI, MMLU, and BBH. The datasets, models, and code are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/FoVer.

<div> keyword: Neural language models, factual knowledge, Large Memory Language Models, pre-training, knowledge bases 

Summary: <br /><br />Neural language models often struggle with managing factual knowledge due to the opaque nature of their parameters. The proposed Large Memory Language Models (LMLM) address this issue by storing factual information in both internal weights and an external database. By masking externally retrieved facts during training, LMLMs learn to perform targeted lookups instead of relying solely on memorization. Experimental results show that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to larger knowledge-dense models while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases. This approach marks a significant shift in how language models handle and utilize factual knowledge, providing a more transparent and reliable way to access and update specific facts. <div>
arXiv:2505.15962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

The study evaluates the performance of five Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving and explaining six Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM shows limited success in solving the puzzles, none of the models are able to provide explanations that reflect strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. The findings highlight the challenges that need to be overcome for LLMs to become reliable partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making. The success of these models in such decision-making processes depends on their ability to offer trustworthy, gradual, and tailored explanations. The study emphasizes the importance of clear and customized explanations, especially in complex puzzle-solving scenarios like Sudoku. The inability of current LLMs to provide satisfactory explanations underscores the need for further research and development in this area. <div>

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in human-AI collaborative decision-making hinges on their ability to provide trustworthy, gradual, and tailored explanations. Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining \sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, syntax, causal interpretability, English filler-gap dependency constructions, linguistic theory

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable tools for linguists studying syntax. Causal interpretability methods applied to LLMs can enhance the evidence they provide by revealing the abstract mechanisms these models use. Through experiments using Distributed Interchange Interventions, LLMs demonstrate convergent abstract analyses of English filler-gap dependency constructions. These analyses not only confirm existing linguistic theories but also uncover overlooked factors like frequency, filler type, and context that could prompt revisions to current theories. By delving into the internal mechanisms of LLMs, new insights emerge that can advance linguistic theory in understanding syntactic structures. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful sources of evidence for linguists seeking to develop theories of syntax. In this paper, we argue that causal interpretability methods, applied to LLMs, can greatly enhance the value of such evidence by helping us characterize the abstract mechanisms that LLMs learn to use. Our empirical focus is a set of English filler-gap dependency constructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely agree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based in Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LLMs converge on similar abstract analyses of these constructions. These analyses also reveal previously overlooked factors -- relating to frequency, filler type, and surrounding context -- that could motivate changes to standard linguistic theory. Overall, these results suggest that mechanistic, internal analyses of LLMs can push linguistic theory forward.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm for evaluating language models and discusses calibration techniques for aligning evaluators with human judgment. However, existing calibration methods have shown limitations in real-world, open-ended tasks. The study introduces SLMEval, a novel calibration method based on entropy maximization using a small amount of human preference data. This approach reweights evaluator scores to achieve strong correlation with human evaluations in two real-world production use cases and a public benchmark. For instance, SLMEval outperforms G-eval by achieving a Spearman correlation of 0.57 with human judgments on a specific task. In addition, SLMEval reduces evaluation costs significantly compared to GPT-4-based calibrated evaluators like G-eval. <div>

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm offers a scalable, reference-free approach for evaluating language models. Although several calibration techniques have been proposed to better align these evaluators with human judgment, prior studies focus primarily on narrow, well-structured benchmarks. As a result, it remains unclear whether such calibrations generalize to real-world, open-ended tasks.
  In this work, we show that SOTA calibrated evaluators often fail in these settings, exhibiting weak or even negative correlation with human judgments. To address this, we propose SLMEval, a novel and efficient calibration method based on entropy maximization over a small amount of human preference data. By estimating a latent distribution over model quality and reweighting evaluator scores accordingly, SLMEval achieves strong correlation with human evaluations across two real-world production use cases and the public benchmark. For example, on one such task, SLMEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.57 with human judgments, while G-Eval yields a negative correlation. In addition, SLMEval reduces evaluation costs by 5-30x compared to GPT-4-based calibrated evaluators such as G-eval.

<div> graph optimization, few-shot, cross-lingual, embedding inversion attacks, privacy vulnerabilities

Summary:
The proposed LAGO approach addresses privacy vulnerabilities in multilingual NLP systems through few-shot cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks. It models linguistic relationships using a graph-based constrained distributed optimization framework, integrating syntactic and lexical similarity as edge constraints for collaborative parameter learning across related languages. The method generalizes prior approaches and includes Frobenius-norm regularization with linear inequality or total variation constraints for robust alignment of cross-lingual embedding spaces with limited data. Extensive experiments show that LAGO significantly improves attack transferability, highlighting the importance of language similarity in privacy-preserving multilingual embeddings. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose LAGO - Language Similarity-Aware Graph Optimization - a novel approach for few-shot cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks, addressing critical privacy vulnerabilities in multilingual NLP systems. Unlike prior work in embedding inversion attacks that treat languages independently, LAGO explicitly models linguistic relationships through a graph-based constrained distributed optimization framework. By integrating syntactic and lexical similarity as edge constraints, our method enables collaborative parameter learning across related languages. Theoretically, we show this formulation generalizes prior approaches, such as ALGEN, which emerges as a special case when similarity constraints are relaxed. Our framework uniquely combines Frobenius-norm regularization with linear inequality or total variation constraints, ensuring robust alignment of cross-lingual embedding spaces even with extremely limited data (as few as 10 samples per language). Extensive experiments across multiple languages and embedding models demonstrate that LAGO substantially improves the transferability of attacks with 10-20% increase in Rouge-L score over baselines. This work establishes language similarity as a critical factor in inversion attack transferability, urging renewed focus on language-aware privacy-preserving multilingual embeddings.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, METEORA, Rationales, Adversarial Content, Explainability<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines are limited by heuristic-based retrieval and lack of explainability and robustness against adversarial content. METEORA, a novel method, replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach. It uses general-purpose LLMs to generate rationales that guide evidence chunk selection in a three-stage process. This eliminates the need for top-k heuristics and enhances generation accuracy by 33.34% while using fewer chunks. METEORA also includes a Verifier LLM for consistency checks to detect and filter poisoned content, improving resilience to poisoning attacks. Overall, METEORA improves explainability, interpretability, generation accuracy, and resilience to adversarial content in RAG pipelines. <div>

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach. METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance, global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation. The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to 0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating strong resilience to poisoning attacks.

<div> Keywords: incentive training, reinforcement learning, language models, text-to-text tasks, NOVER

Summary: 
NOVER is a new reinforcement learning framework that does not require an external verifier, making it applicable to text-to-text tasks without the need for high-quality annotated data. It surpasses models distilled from large reasoning models like DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. NOVER introduces the concept of inverse incentive training and provides flexibility in optimizing large language models to improve performance across a wide range of tasks. By focusing on the final answer part of a language model's output, NOVER promotes the generation of intermediate reasoning steps, enhancing the model's overall performance in various domains. <div>
arXiv:2505.16022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances such as DeepSeek R1-Zero highlight the effectiveness of incentive training, a reinforcement learning paradigm that computes rewards solely based on the final answer part of a language model's output, thereby encouraging the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. However, these methods fundamentally rely on external verifiers, which limits their applicability to domains like mathematics and coding where such verifiers are readily available. Although reward models can serve as verifiers, they require high-quality annotated data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose NOVER, NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning, a general reinforcement learning framework that requires only standard supervised fine-tuning data with no need for an external verifier. NOVER enables incentive training across a wide range of text-to-text tasks and outperforms the model of the same size distilled from large reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. Moreover, the flexibility of NOVER enables new possibilities for optimizing large language models, such as inverse incentive training.

<div> Keywords: large language models, collaborative behavior, user interaction, writing tasks, AI assistants
Summary: 
This article presents a large-scale analysis of collaborative behavior between users and large language models (LLMs) during writing tasks with AI assistants such as Bing Copilot and WildChat. The study identifies Prototypical Human-AI Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs) that represent common ways users interact with LLMs, including revising intents, exploring texts, posing questions, adjusting style, and injecting new content. These PATHs explain the majority of variation in user-LLM interactions and are correlated with specific writing intents. The findings highlight how users actively refine, explore, and co-construct text with LLMs, indicating a shift from passive acceptance of output. The study suggests implications for improving LLM alignment with user needs. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are used in complex writing workflows, users engage in multi-turn interactions to steer generations to better fit their needs. Rather than passively accepting output, users actively refine, explore, and co-construct text. We conduct a large-scale analysis of this collaborative behavior for users engaged in writing tasks in the wild with two popular AI assistants, Bing Copilot and WildChat. Our analysis goes beyond simple task classification or satisfaction estimation common in prior work and instead characterizes how users interact with LLMs through the course of a session. We identify prototypical behaviors in how users interact with LLMs in prompts following their original request. We refer to these as Prototypical Human-AI Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs) and find that a small group of PATHs explain a majority of the variation seen in user-LLM interaction. These PATHs span users revising intents, exploring texts, posing questions, adjusting style or injecting new content. Next, we find statistically significant correlations between specific writing intents and PATHs, revealing how users' intents shape their collaboration behaviors. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on LLM alignment.

Summary:
Generative large language models have the potential for significant impact, but also raise ethical concerns. This study provides a broad ethical evaluation of 29 recent open-source large language models across four aspects: Robustness, reliability, safety, and fairness. The assessment was conducted in both English and Turkish languages to ensure diversity in language coverage. The results show that many open-source models prioritize safety and fairness, with good robustness but concerns remain regarding reliability. Ethical evaluation can effectively be done independently of language used. Models with larger parameter counts tend to exhibit better ethical performance. The Gemma and Qwen models are highlighted as demonstrating the most ethical behavior among those evaluated. This study aims to guide safer model development by addressing gaps in evaluation breadth, language coverage, and model diversity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generative large language models present significant potential but also raise critical ethical concerns. Most studies focus on narrow ethical dimensions, and also limited diversity of languages and models. To address these gaps, we conduct a broad ethical evaluation of 29 recent open-source large language models using a novel data collection including four ethical aspects: Robustness, reliability, safety, and fairness. We analyze model behavior in both a commonly used language, English, and a low-resource language, Turkish. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive ethical assessment and guide safer model development by filling existing gaps in evaluation breadth, language coverage, and model diversity. Our experimental results, based on LLM-as-a-Judge, reveal that optimization efforts for many open-source models appear to have prioritized safety and fairness, and demonstrated good robustness while reliability remains a concern. We demonstrate that ethical evaluation can be effectively conducted independently of the language used. In addition, models with larger parameter counts tend to exhibit better ethical performance, with Gemma and Qwen models demonstrating the most ethical behavior among those evaluated.

The paper evaluates prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based text classification, focusing on industrial scenarios like email classification, legal document categorization, and classifying long academic texts. Decoder-only models like Llama show strong performance but are inefficient in inference due to token-by-token generation.

Abstract: With the emergence of ChatGPT, Transformer models have significantly advanced text classification and related tasks. Decoder-only models such as Llama exhibit strong performance and flexibility, yet they suffer from inefficiency on inference due to token-by-token generation, and their effectiveness in text classification tasks heavily depends on prompt quality. Moreover, their substantial GPU resource requirements often limit widespread adoption. Thus, the question of whether smaller language models are capable of effectively handling text classification tasks emerges as a topic of significant interest. However, the selection of appropriate models and methodologies remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based text classification. Specifically, we focus on practical industrial scenarios, including email classification, legal document categorization, and the classification of extremely long academic texts. We examine the strengths and limitations of smaller models, with particular attention to both their performance and their efficiency in Video Random-Access Memory (VRAM) utilization, thereby providing valuable insights for the local deployment and application of compact models in industrial settings.

The annotation pipeline incorporates worker qualification and has been refined through analysis. The inter-annotator agreement is quantified, misalignment with source-level outlet bias is analyzed, and labels are organized into interpretable subsets. Simulation using GPT-4o shows mirrored asymmetries in misclassifying subtly right-leaning content. Two modeling tasks are defined: perception drift prediction and rationale type classification, with baseline performance reported. Rich rationale annotations aim to facilitate explainable modeling of political bias.

Abstract: We present BiasLab, a dataset of 300 political news articles annotated for perceived ideological bias. These articles were selected from a curated 900-document pool covering diverse political events and source biases. Each article is labeled by crowdworkers along two independent scales, assessing sentiment toward the Democratic and Republican parties, and enriched with rationale indicators. The annotation pipeline incorporates targeted worker qualification and was refined through pilot-phase analysis. We quantify inter-annotator agreement, analyze misalignment with source-level outlet bias, and organize the resulting labels into interpretable subsets. Additionally, we simulate annotation using schema-constrained GPT-4o, enabling direct comparison to human labels and revealing mirrored asymmetries, especially in misclassifying subtly right-leaning content. We define two modeling tasks: perception drift prediction and rationale type classification, and report baseline performance to illustrate the challenge of explainable bias detection. BiasLab's rich rationale annotations provide actionable interpretations that facilitate explainable modeling of political bias, supporting the development of transparent, socially aware NLP systems. We release the dataset, annotation schema, and modeling code to encourage research on human-in-the-loop interpretability and the evaluation of explanation effectiveness in real-world settings.

Abstract: Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments, e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future regimes; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day).

Summary: bRAGgen, an adaptive retrieval-augmented generation model, addresses healthcare disparities in bariatric surgery by integrating real-time medical evidence to provide accurate information. Patient engagement with multidisciplinary providers is crucial for successful bariatric and metabolic surgery (MBS) outcomes. Access barriers hinder the patient journey, but bRAGq, a dataset of bariatric surgery-related questions, aims to bridge this gap. The model surpasses state-of-the-art models in generating clinically accurate responses, validated by an expert bariatric surgeon. Effective longitudinal care, from preoperative preparation to postoperative management, can be facilitated by bRAGgen's self-updating architecture.Enhancing patient access to evidence-based information is essential in optimizing MBS treatment effectiveness. Healthcare disparities can be mitigated through innovative models like bRAGgen, ensuring accurate and timely information exchange between patients and healthcare providers. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While bariatric and metabolic surgery (MBS) is considered the gold standard treatment for severe and morbid obesity, its therapeutic efficacy hinges upon active and longitudinal engagement with multidisciplinary providers, including surgeons, dietitians/nutritionists, psychologists, and endocrinologists. This engagement spans the entire patient journey, from preoperative preparation to long-term postoperative management. However, this process is often hindered by numerous healthcare disparities, such as logistical and access barriers, which impair easy patient access to timely, evidence-based, clinician-endorsed information. To address these gaps, we introduce bRAGgen, a novel adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based model that autonomously integrates real-time medical evidence when response confidence dips below dynamic thresholds. This self-updating architecture ensures that responses remain current and accurate, reducing the risk of misinformation. Additionally, we present bRAGq, a curated dataset of 1,302 bariatric surgery--related questions, validated by an expert bariatric surgeon. bRAGq constitutes the first large-scale, domain-specific benchmark for comprehensive MBS care. In a two-phase evaluation, bRAGgen is benchmarked against state-of-the-art models using both large language model (LLM)--based metrics and expert surgeon review. Across all evaluation dimensions, bRAGgen demonstrates substantially superior performance in generating clinically accurate and relevant responses.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach, Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR), to address the issue of safety performance degradation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) post-network pruning. HSR quantifies the contribution of each attention head to safety and selectively restores critical neurons within these attention heads to hierarchically realign safety. This process progresses from the attention head level to the neuron level, enhancing safety performance across various models and pruning strategies. HSR stands out as the first work explicitly focused on restoring safety in LVLMs after pruning, offering notable improvements in safety performance. <div>

Abstract: With the increasing size of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), network pruning techniques aimed at compressing models for deployment in resource-constrained environments have garnered significant attention. However, we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on restoring safety in LVLMs post-pruning.

The intuition behind this is that the programming languages (PLs) inherently exhibit greater structural organization than natural languages (NLs). This structural advantage makes PLs particularly suited for IE tasks. Nevertheless, existing research primarily focuses on Python for code-style simulation, overlooking the potential of other widely-used PLs (e.g., C++ and Java) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase. In this research, we propose \textbf{M}ultiple \textbf{P}rogramming \textbf{L}anguages with large language models for information extraction (abbreviated as \textbf{MPL}), a novel framework that explores the potential of incorporating different PLs in the SFT phase. Additionally, we introduce \texttt{function-prompt} with virtual running to simulate code-style inputs more effectively and efficiently. Experimental results on a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPL. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis. We have released our code for future research.

Summary: This study introduces a dual-method LLM framework for analyzing user-generated content (UGC) in social media for travel decisions. By combining unsupervised expectation extraction with supervised fine-tuning informed by surveys, the framework reveals that leisure and social expectations are key drivers of engagement in UGC, more so than foundational natural and emotional factors. The study establishes LLMs as precision tools for quantifying expectations, advancing tourism analytics methodology. It also proposes targeted strategies for personalized experiences and social travel promotion. The framework's adaptability extends to consumer behavior research, showcasing the transformative potential of computational social science in optimizing marketing strategies. <div>

Abstract: Social media's rise establishes user-generated content (UGC) as pivotal for travel decisions, yet analytical methods lack scalability. This study introduces a dual-method LLM framework: unsupervised expectation extraction from UGC paired with survey-informed supervised fine-tuning. Findings reveal leisure/social expectations drive engagement more than foundational natural/emotional factors. By establishing LLMs as precision tools for expectation quantification, we advance tourism analytics methodology and propose targeted strategies for experience personalization and social travel promotion. The framework's adaptability extends to consumer behavior research, demonstrating computational social science's transformative potential in marketing optimization.

<div> Benchmark, Korean, linguistic tasks, large language models, evaluation<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces KoBALT, a comprehensive linguistic benchmark for evaluating large language models in Korean. It consists of 700 multiple-choice questions across five linguistic domains: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology. KoBALT addresses the limitations of conventional benchmarks by providing linguistically motivated questions with minimal n-gram overlap with standard Korean corpora to prevent data contamination. Evaluation of 20 LLMs shows varying performance across linguistic domains, with the highest achieving 61% general accuracy. Human preference evaluation validates KoBALT's effectiveness in assessing Korean language understanding. The benchmark aims to bridge the gap in linguistic evaluation for diverse languages and offers a robust framework for evaluating linguistic competence in Korean language models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We introduce KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks), a comprehensive linguistically-motivated benchmark comprising 700 multiple-choice questions spanning 24 phenomena across five linguistic domains: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology. KoBALT is designed to advance the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in Korean, a morphologically rich language, by addressing the limitations of conventional benchmarks that often lack linguistic depth and typological grounding. It introduces a suite of expert-curated, linguistically motivated questions with minimal n-gram overlap with standard Korean corpora, substantially mitigating the risk of data contamination and allowing a more robust assessment of true language understanding. Our evaluation of 20 contemporary LLMs reveals significant performance disparities, with the highest-performing model achieving 61\% general accuracy but showing substantial variation across linguistic domains - from stronger performance in semantics (66\%) to considerable weaknesses in phonology (31\%) and morphology (36\%). Through human preference evaluation with 95 annotators, we demonstrate a strong correlation between KoBALT scores and human judgments, validating our benchmark's effectiveness as a discriminative measure of Korean language understanding. KoBALT addresses critical gaps in linguistic evaluation for typologically diverse languages and provides a robust framework for assessing genuine linguistic competence in Korean language models.

<div> veracity, biases, LLMs, demographics, solutions
<br />
Summary: 
This study examines the biases present in Large Language Models (LLMs) regarding the association of solution veracity with demographics. Two types of biases were identified: Attribution Bias, where correct solutions are disproportionately attributed to certain demographic groups, and Evaluation Bias, where models assess solutions differently based on perceived author demographics. The experiments conducted on five value-aligned LLMs revealed consistent biases: African-American groups were given fewer correct solutions in math and coding tasks, while Asian authorships were least favored in writing evaluations. The models also automatically assigned racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in visualization code, indicating deeply embedded biases in their reasoning processes. These findings highlight the need for caution in deploying LLMs in educational and evaluation settings due to the pervasive demographic biases present.

Abstract: Despite LLMs' explicit alignment against demographic stereotypes, they have been shown to exhibit biases under various social contexts. In this work, we find that LLMs exhibit concerning biases in how they associate solution veracity with demographics. Through experiments across five human value-aligned LLMs on mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems, we reveal two forms of such veracity biases: Attribution Bias, where models disproportionately attribute correct solutions to certain demographic groups, and Evaluation Bias, where models' assessment of identical solutions varies based on perceived demographic authorship. Our results show pervasive biases: LLMs consistently attribute fewer correct solutions and more incorrect ones to African-American groups in math and coding, while Asian authorships are least preferred in writing evaluation. In additional studies, we show LLMs automatically assign racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in visualization code, suggesting these biases are deeply embedded in models' reasoning processes. Our findings indicate that demographic bias extends beyond surface-level stereotypes and social context provocations, raising concerns about LLMs' deployment in educational and evaluation settings.

Summary: <br />
Recent studies have explored the application of large language models (LLMs) in machine translation quality estimation (MTQE) by utilizing direct scoring methods, but these approaches often show low correlation with human judgments at the segment level. This paper introduces a generation-based evaluation paradigm that uses decoder-only LLMs to generate high-quality references, followed by semantic similarity scoring with sentence embeddings. The study conducted a comprehensive evaluation across 8 LLMs and 8 language pairs, demonstrating that the proposed method outperforms intra-LLM direct scoring baselines and external non-LLM reference-free metrics from MTME. The results highlight the effectiveness of generation-based evaluation and suggest a shift towards hybrid approaches that combine fluent generation with accurate semantic assessment. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent studies have applied large language models (LLMs) to machine translation quality estimation (MTQE) by prompting models to assign numeric scores. Nonetheless, these direct scoring methods tend to show low segment-level correlation with human judgments. In this paper, we propose a generation-based evaluation paradigm that leverages decoder-only LLMs to produce high-quality references, followed by semantic similarity scoring using sentence embeddings. We conduct the most extensive evaluation to date in MTQE, covering 8 LLMs and 8 language pairs. Empirical results show that our method outperforms both intra-LLM direct scoring baselines and external non-LLM reference-free metrics from MTME. These findings demonstrate the strength of generation-based evaluation and support a shift toward hybrid approaches that combine fluent generation with accurate semantic assessment.

<div> positional bias, model uncertainty, syntax, prompting, language diversity, language models

Positional bias in large language models varies across different languages, with the Qwen2.5-7B model showing a preference for late positions instead of the expected early-token bias. Explicit positional guidance reduces accuracy in all languages, challenging common prompt-engineering practices. Aligning context with positional bias increases entropy but does not predict accuracy reliably. Language models impose dominant word order even in free-word-order languages like Hindi. This cross-linguistic study sheds light on how positional bias interacts with model uncertainty, syntax, and prompting, revealing language-specific variations and challenging assumptions about language processing in large language models.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit positional bias -- systematic neglect of information at specific context positions -- yet its interplay with linguistic diversity remains poorly understood. We present a cross-linguistic study across five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi, Vietnamese), examining how positional bias interacts with model uncertainty, syntax, and prompting. Key findings: (1) Positional bias is model-driven, with language-specific variations -- Qwen2.5-7B favors late positions, challenging assumptions of early-token bias; (2) Explicit positional guidance (e.g., correct context is at position X) reduces accuracy across languages, undermining prompt-engineering practices; (3) Aligning context with positional bias increases entropy, yet minimal entropy does not predict accuracy. (4) We further uncover that LLMs differently impose dominant word order in free-word-order languages like Hindi.

<div> fine-tuning, Large Language Models (LLMs), meta-reasoning, reinforcement learning, distillation 

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach, RLKD, for distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models in Large Language Models (LLMs). The current method of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often lacks the complexity of authentic reasoning paths, which involve meta-reasoning and solving within a multi-branch structure. RLKD proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework guided by a Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM) to capture this rich reasoning structure. By converting reasoning paths into meta-reasoning-solving steps, RLKD allows student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit reasoning structure. Experiments demonstrate that RLKD outperforms traditional SFT-RL pipelines, even with minimal training data, highlighting the potential for enhanced student reasoning through this new approach.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning (which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving (which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime, unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.

Abstract: As large language models continue to advance, their application in educational contexts remains underexplored and under-optimized. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the first diverse benchmark tailored for educational scenarios, incorporating synthetic data containing 9 major scenarios and over 4,000 distinct educational contexts. To enable comprehensive assessment, we propose a set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics that cover 12 critical aspects relevant to both teachers and students. We further apply human annotation to ensure the effectiveness of the model-generated evaluation responses. Additionally, we succeed to train a relatively small-scale model on our constructed dataset and demonstrate that it can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art large models (e.g., Deepseek V3, Qwen Max) on the test set. Overall, this work provides a practical foundation for the development and evaluation of education-oriented language models. Code and data are released at https://github.com/ybai-nlp/EduBench.

They observe that drafting with layer skipping in SSD can be sensitive to domain shifts, resulting in a drop in acceleration performance. By leveraging K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search, KNN-SSD matches different skipped layers with various domain inputs, leading to a 1.3x-1.6x speedup in LLM inference across multiple tasks and models.

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a widely used paradigm to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs) without compromising generation quality. It works by efficiently drafting multiple tokens using a compact model and then verifying them in parallel using the target LLM. Notably, Self-Speculative Decoding proposes skipping certain layers to construct the draft model, which eliminates the need for additional parameters or training. Despite its strengths, we observe in this work that drafting with layer skipping exhibits significant sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a substantial drop in acceleration performance. To enhance the domain generalizability of this paradigm, we introduce KNN-SSD, an algorithm that leverages K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search to match different skipped layers with various domain inputs. We evaluated our algorithm in various models and multiple tasks, observing that its application leads to 1.3x-1.6x speedup in LLM inference.

Large language models (LLMs) are being studied as potential substitutes for human participants in cognitive tasks, such as the phonemic fluency task where words starting with a specific letter are generated. This study evaluated 34 different LLM configurations to determine their ability to approximate human behavioral variability. The results showed that while some configurations were able to match human averages and lexical preferences, none were able to capture the full extent of human variability. LLM outputs were found to be less diverse and rigid in structure compared to human responses.

These findings highlight the limitations of using LLMs to simulate human cognition and behavior.<br /><br />Summary: Large language models were assessed for their ability to mimic individual differences in the phonemic fluency task, but none could fully replicate human variability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as substitutes for human participants in cognitive tasks, but their ability to simulate human behavioral variability remains unclear. This study examines whether LLMs can approximate individual differences in the phonemic fluency task, where participants generate words beginning with a target letter. We evaluated 34 model configurations, varying prompt specificity, sampling temperature, and model type, and compared outputs to responses from 106 human participants. While some configurations, especially Claude 3.7 Sonnet, matched human averages and lexical preferences, none reproduced the scope of human variability. LLM outputs were consistently less diverse and structurally rigid, and LLM ensembles failed to increase diversity. Network analyses further revealed fundamental differences in retrieval structure between humans and models. These results highlight key limitations in using LLMs to simulate human cognition and behavior.

<div> Keywords: large language models, retraction, errors, internal belief, supervised fine-tuning <br />
Summary: <br />
In the study, the researchers explore how large language models (LLMs) acknowledge errors in their generated answers, defined as "retraction." They find that LLMs retract incorrect answers infrequently, often influenced by internal beliefs about the correctness of the answer. Models tend to retract answers they do not believe to be factually accurate, showing a causal relationship between internal belief and retraction behavior. Additionally, experiments show that models alter attention behavior during self-verification when they do not believe their answers. Furthermore, supervised fine-tuning significantly improves retraction performance by enhancing the model's ability to learn more accurate internal beliefs. The study provides insights into the dynamics of error acknowledgment and decision-making in LLMs, shedding light on ways to enhance their accuracy and reliability. <div>
arXiv:2505.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) admit their mistakes when they should know better? In this work, we define the behavior of acknowledging errors in previously generated answers as "retraction" and aim to understand when and why LLMs choose to retract. We first construct model-specific datasets to evaluate whether a model will retract an incorrect answer that contradicts its own parametric knowledge. While LLMs are capable of retraction, they do so only infrequently. We demonstrate that retraction is closely tied to previously identified indicators of models' internal belief: models fail to retract wrong answers that they "believe" to be factually correct. Steering experiments further demonstrate that internal belief causally influences model retraction. In particular, when the model does not believe its answer, this not only encourages the model to attempt to verify the answer, but also alters attention behavior during self-verification. Finally, we demonstrate that simple supervised fine-tuning significantly improves retraction performance by helping the model learn more accurate internal beliefs. Code and datasets are available on https://github.com/ayyyq/llm-retraction.

Summary:
The study focuses on simplifying health information for better understanding using generative AI, but notes that crucial information may be lost in the process. They compared different approaches to detect and insert missing information into simplified text. Results showed that adding missing entities improved text regeneration, with adding all missing entities being the most effective method. This was found to be better than adding top-ranked entities or random words. The study used cosine similarity and ROUGE scores to evaluate semantic similarity and content overlap between original, simplified, and reconstructed text. Overall, the findings suggest that identifying and adding missing entities can enhance the quality of simplified health information.

Abstract: Understanding health information is essential in achieving and maintaining a healthy life. We focus on simplifying health information for better understanding. With the availability of generative AI, the simplification process has become efficient and of reasonable quality, however, the algorithms remove information that may be crucial for comprehension. In this study, we compare generative AI to detect missing information in simplified text, evaluate its importance, and fix the text with the missing information. We collected 50 health information texts and simplified them using gpt-4-0613. We compare five approaches to identify missing elements and regenerate the text by inserting the missing elements. These five approaches involve adding missing entities and missing words in various ways: 1) adding all the missing entities, 2) adding all missing words, 3) adding the top-3 entities ranked by gpt-4-0613, and 4, 5) serving as controls for comparison, adding randomly chosen entities. We use cosine similarity and ROUGE scores to evaluate the semantic similarity and content overlap between the original, simplified, and reconstructed simplified text. We do this for both summaries and full text. Overall, we find that adding missing entities improves the text. Adding all the missing entities resulted in better text regeneration, which was better than adding the top-ranked entities or words, or random words. Current tools can identify these entities, but are not valuable in ranking them.

<div> training strategies, fact recall, language models, mixed training, shared parameters <br />
Summary:
This study explores how different training strategies affect the ability of language models (LMs) to recall factual knowledge. Traditional two-stage training, involving fact-storing examples followed by fact-recalling examples, often leads to rote memorization. In contrast, mixed training, which integrates both types of examples, has been shown to improve fact recall. The research introduces cross-task gradient trace to analyze shared parameters that are influenced by both types of examples. Results from experiments with synthetic datasets and two large models indicate that mixed training leads to a larger and more centralized set of shared parameters. This suggests that the emergence of specific parameters plays a crucial role in helping LMs generalize factual knowledge effectively across different task formulations. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.16178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fact recall, the ability of language models (LMs) to retrieve specific factual knowledge, remains a challenging task despite their impressive general capabilities. Common training strategies often struggle to promote robust recall behavior with two-stage training, which first trains a model with fact-storing examples (e.g., factual statements) and then with fact-recalling examples (question-answer pairs), tending to encourage rote memorization rather than generalizable fact retrieval. In contrast, mixed training, which jointly uses both types of examples, has been empirically shown to improve the ability to recall facts, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how these training strategies affect how model parameters are shaped during training and how these differences relate to their ability to recall facts. We introduce cross-task gradient trace to identify shared parameters, those strongly influenced by both fact-storing and fact-recalling examples. Our analysis on synthetic fact recall datasets with the Llama-3.2B and Pythia-2.8B models reveals that mixed training encouraging a larger and more centralized set of shared parameters. These findings suggest that the emergence of parameters may play a key role in enabling LMs to generalize factual knowledge across task formulations.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel supervised steering approach for large language models (LLMs) that operates in sparse, interpretable representation spaces. It uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to obtain sparse latent representations that aim to disentangle semantic attributes from model activations. Linear classifiers are then trained to identify task-relevant dimensions in these representations, followed by the learning of supervised steering vectors constrained to this subspace to align with desired behaviors. Experiments across sentiment, truthfulness, and politics polarity steering tasks demonstrate that the supervised steering vectors achieve higher success rates with minimal degradation in generation quality compared to existing methods. The analysis also reveals that a small subspace is sufficient for effective steering, allowing for more targeted and interpretable interventions. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but controlling their behavior reliably remains challenging, especially in open-ended generation settings. This paper introduces a novel supervised steering approach that operates in sparse, interpretable representation spaces. We employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs)to obtain sparse latent representations that aim to disentangle semantic attributes from model activations. Then we train linear classifiers to identify a small subspace of task-relevant dimensions in latent representations. Finally, we learn supervised steering vectors constrained to this subspace, optimized to align with target behaviors. Experiments across sentiment, truthfulness, and politics polarity steering tasks with multiple LLMs demonstrate that our supervised steering vectors achieve higher success rates with minimal degradation in generation quality compared to existing methods. Further analysis reveals that a notably small subspace is sufficient for effective steering, enabling more targeted and interpretable interventions.

Summary: 
The paper explores the relationship between emotion, embodiment, and everyday language by analyzing body part mentions (BPMs) in online English text. BPMs are common in personal narratives and tweets, with patterns varying by time and location. The text containing BPMs tends to be more emotionally charged, even when not explicitly describing physical reactions. The study also finds a strong correlation between body-related language and a range of poorer health outcomes. This research highlights the potential for future studies at the intersection of NLP, affective sciences, and human wellbeing. <div>

Abstract: This paper is the first investigation of the connection between emotion, embodiment, and everyday language in a large sample of natural language data. We created corpora of body part mentions (BPMs) in online English text (blog posts and tweets). This includes a subset featuring human annotations for the emotions of the person whose body part is mentioned in the text. We show that BPMs are common in personal narratives and tweets (~5% to 10% of posts include BPMs) and that their usage patterns vary markedly by time and %geographic location. Using word-emotion association lexicons and our annotated data, we show that text containing BPMs tends to be more emotionally charged, even when the BPM is not explicitly used to describe a physical reaction to the emotion in the text. Finally, we discover a strong and statistically significant correlation between body-related language and a variety of poorer health outcomes. In sum, we argue that investigating the role of body-part related words in language can open up valuable avenues of future research at the intersection of NLP, the affective sciences, and the study of human wellbeing.

Summary: 
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced to address various tasks under a zero-shot paradigm, but struggle with Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). This study extends the zero-shot paradigm to In-Context Learning (ICL) and optimizes three key factors related to demonstrations: retrieval, presentation, and distribution. The researchers discover and counteract a sentimental predictive bias in MLLMs. Strategies for these factors result in average accuracy improvements of 15.9% on six MSA datasets compared to the zero-shot paradigm and 11.2% compared to a random ICL baseline. <div>

Abstract: The advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled various multimodal tasks to be addressed under a zero-shot paradigm. This paradigm sidesteps the cost of model fine-tuning, emerging as a dominant trend in practical application. Nevertheless, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), a pivotal challenge in the quest for general artificial intelligence, fails to accommodate this convenience. The zero-shot paradigm exhibits undesirable performance on MSA, casting doubt on whether MLLMs can perceive sentiments as competent as supervised models. By extending the zero-shot paradigm to In-Context Learning (ICL) and conducting an in-depth study on configuring demonstrations, we validate that MLLMs indeed possess such capability. Specifically, three key factors that cover demonstrations' retrieval, presentation, and distribution are comprehensively investigated and optimized. A sentimental predictive bias inherent in MLLMs is also discovered and later effectively counteracted. By complementing each other, the devised strategies for three factors result in average accuracy improvements of 15.9% on six MSA datasets against the zero-shot paradigm and 11.2% against the random ICL baseline.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcriptions, but accurately transcribing children's conversational speech remains challenging. In this study, the use of LLMs in correcting ASR errors for children's conversational speech was explored. Experiments on two datasets revealed that LLMs are helpful in correcting zero-shot ASR outputs and fine-tuned CTC-based ASR outputs for children's speech. However, incorporating contextual information or using fine-tuned autoregressive ASR outputs posed challenges for LLMs to improve ASR performance in this context. The study highlights both the promises and limitations of LLMs in enhancing ASR accuracy for children's conversational speech datasets. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has recently shown remarkable progress, but accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving ASR transcriptions. However, their applications in child speech including conversational scenarios are underexplored. In this study, we explore the use of LLMs in correcting ASR errors for conversational child speech. We demonstrate the promises and challenges of LLMs through experiments on two children's conversational speech datasets with both zero-shot and fine-tuned ASR outputs. We find that while LLMs are helpful in correcting zero-shot ASR outputs and fine-tuned CTC-based ASR outputs, it remains challenging for LLMs to improve ASR performance when incorporating contextual information or when using fine-tuned autoregressive ASR (e.g., Whisper) outputs.

<div> idioms, language models, processing ability, contextual cues, reasoning-based inference
<br />
Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can handle idioms in various tasks, but little is known about how LLMs process idioms, especially in multilingual settings. The authors introduce the MIDAS dataset, a large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages with their meanings, and evaluate LLMs' performance in processing idioms. They find that LLMs rely on both memorization and integration of contextual cues and reasoning, particularly for compositional idioms. This suggests that LLMs' understanding of idioms emerges from a combination of internal knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.
<br /><br />Summary: 
- Idioms pose unique challenges for language models.
- Recent studies have used large language models to handle idioms but understanding of LLMs' processing mechanisms in multilingual settings is limited.
- The authors introduce the MIDAS dataset of idioms in six languages paired with their meanings.
- Evaluation of LLMs' processing ability reveals reliance on memorization and integration of contextual cues and reasoning.
- LLMs' understanding of idioms involves a hybrid approach combining internal knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference. <div>

Abstract: Idioms have long posed a challenge due to their unique linguistic properties, which set them apart from other common expressions. While recent studies have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to handle idioms across various tasks, e.g., idiom-containing sentence generation and idiomatic machine translation, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of idiom processing in LLMs, particularly in multilingual settings. To this end, we introduce MIDAS, a new large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages, each paired with its corresponding meaning. Leveraging this resource, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability, identifying key factors that influence their performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs rely not only on memorization, but also adopt a hybrid approach that integrates contextual cues and reasoning, especially when processing compositional idioms. This implies that idiom understanding in LLMs emerges from an interplay between internal knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.

Summary:<br />
This article explores the use of large language models (LLMs) in code evaluation tasks, specifically focusing on their ability to assess semantically equivalent code with superficial variations. The study identifies six types of biases that can affect the evaluation process and shows that LLM judges are susceptible to both positive and negative biases, leading to inflated or unfairly low scores. The researchers conducted experiments across five programming languages and multiple LLMs, finding that even when prompted to generate test cases before scoring, LLM judges remained vulnerable to biases. The study highlights the need for more robust code evaluation methods to ensure fair and accurate assessment of code correctness. <div>
arXiv:2505.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing use of large language models(LLMs) as evaluators, their application has expanded to code evaluation tasks, where they assess the correctness of generated code without relying on reference implementations. While this offers scalability and flexibility, it also raises a critical, unresolved question: Can LLM judges fairly and robustly evaluate semantically equivalent code with superficial variations? Functionally correct code often exhibits variations-such as differences in variable names, comments, or formatting-that should not influence its correctness. Yet, whether LLM judges can reliably handle these variations remains unclear. We present the first comprehensive study of this issue, defining six types of potential bias in code evaluation and revealing their systematic impact on LLM judges. Across five programming languages and multiple LLMs, we empirically demonstrate that all tested LLM judges are susceptible to both positive and negative biases, resulting in inflated or unfairly low scores. Moreover, we observe that LLM judges remain vulnerable to these biases even when prompted to generate test cases before scoring, highlighting the need for more robust code evaluation methods.

Personalizing jargon detection is crucial for enhancing accessibility to technical documents for readers with diverse backgrounds. This study examines efficient and scalable methods for personalized jargon detection, focusing on lightweight fine-tuning and personalized prompting approaches. The personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 and achieves comparable performance with minimal annotated data. Hybrid approaches combining limited annotations with user background signals are also explored.

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

This approach combines large language models with a retrieval-augmented generation framework to retrieve similar ideas and determine if a new idea belongs to an existing category or forms a new one.

arXiv:2505.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An objective, face-valid way to assess the originality of creative ideas is to measure how rare each idea is within a population -- an approach long used in creativity research but difficult to automate at scale. Tabulating response frequencies via manual bucketing of idea rephrasings is labor-intensive, error-prone, and brittle under large corpora. We introduce a fully automated, psychometrically validated pipeline for frequency-based originality scoring. Our method, MuseRAG, combines large language models (LLMs) with an externally orchestrated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Given a new idea, the system retrieves semantically similar prior idea buckets and zero-shot prompts the LLM to judge whether the new idea belongs to an existing bucket or forms a new one. The resulting buckets enable computation of frequency-based originality metrics. Across five datasets (N=1143, n_ideas=16294), MuseRAG matches human annotators in idea clustering structure and resolution (AMI = 0.59) and in participant-level scoring (r = 0.89) -- while exhibiting strong convergent and external validity. Our work enables intent-sensitive, human-aligned originality scoring at scale to aid creativity research.

<div> benchmark, language models, length instructions, evaluation, limitations
Summary:<br />
- The article introduces a new benchmark called LIFEBench to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow length instructions.<br />
- LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in English and Chinese with length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192 words.<br />
- The evaluation of 26 LLMs reveals that most models struggle to follow length instructions beyond a certain threshold, and many fail to reach maximum output lengths claimed by vendors.<br />
- Even long-context LLMs do not significantly improve in following length instructions.<br />
- Reasoning LLMs perform better than specialized long-text generation models in following length instructions.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) can solve PhD-level reasoning problems over long context inputs, they still struggle with a seemingly simpler task: following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel. Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192 words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall, LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.

<div> Proposed Keywords: Large language models, Retrieval-augmented generation, Graph-based RAG, Align-GRAG, Knowledge integration

Summary: 
Align-GRAG addresses limitations in graph-based Retrieval-augmented generation systems by introducing a novel reasoning-guided dual alignment framework. It efficiently prunes irrelevant knowledge nodes and establishes a unified semantic space through dual alignment of graph nodes and language representations. The method optimizes a graph encoder with LLM-summarized reasoning and leverages KL divergence loss and contrastive loss for alignment. The aligned graph data is integrated with LLM to generate coherent and accurate answers. Experimental results on the GraphQA benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of Align-GRAG across common sense reasoning, scene graph understanding, and knowledge graph reasoning tasks. The proposed method provides a solution to challenges faced by graph RAG systems in leveraging graph structures for enhanced understanding and efficient knowledge integration.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with issues like hallucinations and outdated information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these issues by grounding LLM outputs in external knowledge with an Information Retrieval (IR) system. Building on this foundation, graph-based RAG systems go a step further by retrieving subgraphs, which preserve the relationships between knowledge entities and provide more comprehensive context. However, graph RAG faces two challenges: (1) Retrieving relevant information introduces irrelevant nodes (especially in dense graph databases, where retrieval usually extends to adjacent nodes), and leads to overly lengthy inputs that hinder efficiency; (2) The representation gap between graph and language during generation with LLMs limits the ability to fully leverage graph structures for enhanced understanding. To address these limitations, we propose Align-GRAG, a novel reasoning-guided dual alignment framework in post-retrieval phrase. It first formulates a subgraph by retrieving nodes and edges. Then an Aligner is proposed to jointly optimizes a graph encoder with LLM-summarized reasoning. It achieves dual alignment of graph node and representation by leveraging KL divergence loss and contrastive loss, facilitating efficient pruning of irrelevant knowledge and establishing a unified semantic space. The Generator integrates the aligned graph data with LLM to produce coherent and accurate answers. Experiments on GraphQA benchmark across three tasks (including common sense reasoning, scene graph understanding, and knowledge graph reasoning) validate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be available upon accepted.

<div> Keywords: Large Reasoning Models, jailbreak attack, adaptive encryption, security vulnerabilities, DeepSeek-R1

Summary: 
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown superior logical capabilities compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs). However, potential security vulnerabilities in LRMs have not been extensively explored. A novel jailbreak attack called SEAL has been proposed to target LRMs by using an adaptive encryption pipeline to override their reasoning processes and bypass safety mechanisms. SEAL employs a stacked encryption approach with multiple ciphers that overwhelm the model's reasoning capabilities. Dynamic strategies, such as random and adaptive adjustments to cipher length, order, and combination, are used to prevent LRMs from developing countermeasures. Experimental results on popular reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4 show SEAL's effectiveness, achieving an 80.8% success rate on GPT-o4-mini. Note: The paper may contain inappropriate content. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large Reasoning Models have advanced logical capabilities, but their security vulnerabilities are a concern.

arXiv:2505.16241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated superior logical capabilities compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), gaining significant attention. Despite their impressive performance, the potential for stronger reasoning abilities to introduce more severe security vulnerabilities remains largely underexplored. Existing jailbreak methods often struggle to balance effectiveness with robustness against adaptive safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SEAL, a novel jailbreak attack that targets LRMs through an adaptive encryption pipeline designed to override their reasoning processes and evade potential adaptive alignment. Specifically, SEAL introduces a stacked encryption approach that combines multiple ciphers to overwhelm the models reasoning capabilities, effectively bypassing built-in safety mechanisms. To further prevent LRMs from developing countermeasures, we incorporate two dynamic strategies - random and adaptive - that adjust the cipher length, order, and combination. Extensive experiments on real-world reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, Claude Sonnet, and OpenAI GPT-o4, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, SEAL achieves an attack success rate of 80.8% on GPT o4-mini, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin of 27.2%.

Summary:
Diverse language model responses are essential for various tasks, but common diversity metrics and reward models tend to bias models towards shorter outputs, limiting expressiveness. The Diverse, not Short (Diverse-NS) framework addresses this issue by improving response diversity while maintaining length parity. By generating and filtering preference data, Diverse-NS enables effective training with minimal preference pairs. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B and Olmo-2 models, Diverse-NS significantly enhances lexical and semantic diversity. Smaller models like Olmo-2-7B can also serve as effective diversity teachers for larger models. By explicitly addressing length bias, Diverse-NS pushes models towards more diverse and expressive outputs, leading to consistent improvements in creative generation tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse language model responses are crucial for creative generation, open-ended tasks, and self-improvement training. We show that common diversity metrics, and even reward models used for preference optimization, systematically bias models toward shorter outputs, limiting expressiveness. To address this, we introduce Diverse, not Short (Diverse-NS), a length-controlled self-learning framework that improves response diversity while maintaining length parity. By generating and filtering preference data that balances diversity, quality, and length, Diverse-NS enables effective training using only 3,000 preference pairs. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B and the Olmo-2 family, Diverse-NS substantially enhances lexical and semantic diversity. We show consistent improvement in diversity with minor reduction or gains in response quality on four creative generation tasks: Divergent Associations, Persona Generation, Alternate Uses, and Creative Writing. Surprisingly, experiments with the Olmo-2 model family (7B, and 13B) show that smaller models like Olmo-2-7B can serve as effective "diversity teachers" for larger models. By explicitly addressing length bias, our method efficiently pushes models toward more diverse and expressive outputs.

Summary: 
In the study, researchers investigate the effectiveness of localized unlearning in large language models. They revisit existing approaches and conduct controlled experiments to evaluate the causal relationship between local parameter updates and knowledge removal. The results challenge the assumption that modifying specific parameters leads to effective unlearning, as the set of parameters required for successful knowledge removal is not strictly defined. The findings suggest that parameter locality does not necessarily indicate efficient knowledge removal in localized unlearning approaches. This research highlights the need for a more robust evaluation of the trade-off between removing target knowledge and preserving unrelated general knowledge in language models. <div>
arXiv:2505.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models often retain unintended content, prompting growing interest in knowledge unlearning. Recent approaches emphasize localized unlearning, which restricts parameter updates to specific regions in an effort to remove target knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge. However, their effectiveness remains uncertain due to the lack of robust and thorough evaluation of the trade-off between the competing goals of unlearning. In this paper, we begin by revisiting existing localized unlearning approaches. We then conduct controlled experiments to rigorously evaluate whether local parameter updates causally contribute to unlearning. Our findings reveal that the set of parameters that must be modified for effective unlearning is not strictly determined, challenging the core assumption of localized unlearning that parameter locality is inherently indicative of effective knowledge removal.

IRONIC is a new framework designed to analyze figurative language such as sarcasm across multi-modal inputs. It leverages Multi-modal Coherence Relations to examine referential, analogical, and pragmatic image-text linkages. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection compared to various baselines. This success highlights the importance of incorporating linguistic and cognitive insights into multi-modal reasoning strategies. IRONIC's in-context learning approach enhances the efficiency of sarcasm detection by tapping into cognitive processes that replicate human abilities. It fills the gap left by existing Chain-of-Thought approaches and paves the way for more accurate and nuanced interpretation of figurative language in multi-modal settings.

We present IRONIC, an in-context learning framework that leverages Multi-modal Coherence Relations to analyze referential, analogical and pragmatic image-text linkages. Our experiments show that IRONIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection across different baselines.

<div> Keywords: large language models, fine-tuning, mistake log, transformer copilot, performance improvement

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach called the Transformer Copilot for refining large language models through fine-tuning. By tracking the model's learning behavior and errors with a Mistake Log, a Copilot model is developed to enhance the inference performance of the original Transformer model. The Copilot continuously learns from the Mistake Log during joint training with the Pilot model and rectifies the Pilot's logits for better generation. Experimental results on various tasks show that the Transformer Copilot significantly improves performance, up to 34.5%, with minimal additional computational cost. The framework is scalable and transferable across different benchmarks, demonstrating the potential for enhancing the capabilities of language models in various domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals, analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense, arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and transferability.

Abstract: The achievements of Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing, especially for high-resource languages, call for a better understanding of their characteristics from a cognitive perspective. Researchers have attempted to evaluate artificial models by testing their ability to predict behavioral (e.g., eye-tracking fixations) and physiological (e.g., brain responses) variables during language processing (e.g., reading/listening). In this paper, we propose using spontaneous speech corpora to derive production variables (speech reductions, prosodic prominences) and applying them in a similar fashion. More precisely, we extract. We then test models trained with a standard procedure on different pretraining datasets (written, spoken, and mixed genres) for their ability to predict these two variables. Our results show that, after some fine-tuning, the models can predict these production variables well above baselines. We also observe that spoken genre training data provides more accurate predictions than written genres. These results contribute to the broader effort of using high-quality speech corpora as benchmarks for LLMs.

<title>HiMATE: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation Evaluation</title>

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables flexible and interpretable automatic evaluations. In the field of machine translation evaluation, utilizing LLMs with translation error annotations based on Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) yields more human-aligned judgments. However, current LLM-based evaluation methods still face challenges in accurately identifying error spans and assessing their severity. In this paper, we propose HiMATE, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation Evaluation. We argue that existing approaches inadequately exploit the fine-grained structural and semantic information within the MQM hierarchy. To address this, we develop a hierarchical multi-agent system grounded in the MQM error typology, enabling granular evaluation of subtype errors. Two key strategies are incorporated to further mitigate systemic hallucinations within the framework: the utilization of the model's self-reflection capability and the facilitation of agent discussion involving asymmetric information. Empirically, HiMATE outperforms competitive baselines across different datasets in conducting human-aligned evaluations. Further analyses underscore its significant advantage in error span detection and severity assessment, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 89% over the best-performing baseline. We make our code and data publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiMATE-Anony.

<title>Augmenting LLM Reasoning with Dynamic Notes Writing for Complex QA</title>

Abstract: Iterative RAG for multi-hop question answering faces challenges with lengthy contexts and the buildup of irrelevant information. This hinders a model's capacity to process and reason over retrieved content and limits performance. While recent methods focus on compressing retrieved information, they are either restricted to single-round RAG, require finetuning or lack scalability in iterative RAG. To address these challenges, we propose Notes Writing, a method that generates concise and relevant notes from retrieved documents at each step, thereby reducing noise and retaining only essential information. This indirectly increases the effective context length of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to reason and plan more effectively while processing larger volumes of input text. Notes Writing is framework agnostic and can be integrated with different iterative RAG methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness with three iterative RAG methods, across two models and four evaluation datasets. Notes writing yields an average improvement of 15.6 percentage points overall, with minimal increase in output tokens.

<title>ToDi: Token-wise Distillation via Fine-Grained Divergence Control</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16297</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer impressive performance but are impractical for resource-constrained deployment due to high latency and energy consumption. Knowledge distillation (KD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a smaller student model. However, conventional KD, notably approaches like Forward KL (FKL) and Reverse KL (RKL), apply uniform divergence loss across the entire vocabulary, neglecting token-level prediction discrepancies. By investigating these representative divergences via gradient analysis, we reveal that FKL boosts underestimated tokens, while RKL suppresses overestimated ones, showing their complementary roles. Based on this observation, we propose Token-wise Distillation (ToDi), a novel method that adaptively combines FKL and RKL per token using a sigmoid-based weighting function derived from the teacher-student probability log-ratio. ToDi dynamically emphasizes the appropriate divergence for each token, enabling precise distribution alignment. We demonstrate that ToDi consistently outperforms recent distillation baselines using uniform or less granular strategies across instruction-following benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies and efficiency analysis further validate ToDi's effectiveness and practicality.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing is a pivotal technique for navigating a diverse landscape of LLMs, aiming to select the best-performing LLMs tailored to the domains of user queries, while managing computational resources. However, current routing approaches often face limitations in scalability when dealing with a large pool of specialized LLMs, or in their adaptability to extending model scope and evolving capability domains. To overcome those challenges, we propose InferenceDynamics, a flexible and scalable multi-dimensional routing framework by modeling the capability and knowledge of models. We operate it on our comprehensive dataset RouteMix, and demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability in group-level routing using modern benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, GPQA, BigGenBench, and LiveBench, showcasing its ability to identify and leverage top-performing models for given tasks, leading to superior outcomes with efficient resource utilization. The broader adoption of Inference Dynamics can empower users to harness the full specialized potential of the LLM ecosystem, and our code will be made publicly available to encourage further research.

<title>PMPO: Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization for Small and Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16307</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16307</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt optimization offers a practical and broadly applicable alternative to fine-tuning for improving large language model (LLM) performance. However, existing methods often rely on costly output generation, self-critiquing abilities, or human-annotated preferences, which limit their scalability, especially for smaller or non-instruction-tuned models. We introduce PMPO (Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization), a unified framework that refines prompts using token-level cross-entropy loss as a direct, lightweight evaluation signal. PMPO identifies low-quality prompt segments by masking and measuring their impact on loss, then rewrites and selects improved variants by minimizing loss over positive and negative examples. Unlike prior methods, it requires no output sampling or human evaluation during optimization, relying only on forward passes and log-likelihoods. PMPO supports both supervised and preference-based tasks through a closely aligned loss-based evaluation strategy. Experiments show that PMPO consistently outperforms prior methods across model sizes and tasks: it achieves the highest average accuracy on BBH, performs strongly on GSM8K and AQUA-RAT, and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates by over 19 points. These results highlight PMPO's effectiveness, efficiency, and broad applicability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing metrics often lack the granularity and interpretability to capture nuanced clinical differences between candidate and ground-truth radiology reports, resulting in suboptimal evaluation. We introduce a Clinically-grounded tabular framework with Expert-curated labels and Attribute-level comparison for Radiology report evaluation (CLEAR). CLEAR not only examines whether a report can accurately identify the presence or absence of medical conditions, but also assesses whether it can precisely describe each positively identified condition across five key attributes: first occurrence, change, severity, descriptive location, and recommendation. Compared to prior works, CLEAR's multi-dimensional, attribute-level outputs enable a more comprehensive and clinically interpretable evaluation of report quality. Additionally, to measure the clinical alignment of CLEAR, we collaborate with five board-certified radiologists to develop CLEAR-Bench, a dataset of 100 chest X-ray reports from MIMIC-CXR, annotated across 6 curated attributes and 13 CheXpert conditions. Our experiments show that CLEAR achieves high accuracy in extracting clinical attributes and provides automated metrics that are strongly aligned with clinical judgment.

<title>SC4ANM: Identifying Optimal Section Combinations for Automated Novelty Prediction in Academic Papers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16330</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novelty is a core component of academic papers, and there are multiple perspectives on the assessment of novelty. Existing methods often focus on word or entity combinations, which provide limited insights. The content related to a paper's novelty is typically distributed across different core sections, e.g., Introduction, Methodology and Results. Therefore, exploring the optimal combination of sections for evaluating the novelty of a paper is important for advancing automated novelty assessment. In this paper, we utilize different combinations of sections from academic papers as inputs to drive language models to predict novelty scores. We then analyze the results to determine the optimal section combinations for novelty score prediction. We first employ natural language processing techniques to identify the sectional structure of academic papers, categorizing them into introduction, methods, results, and discussion (IMRaD). Subsequently, we used different combinations of these sections (e.g., introduction and methods) as inputs for pretrained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), employing novelty scores provided by human expert reviewers as ground truth labels to obtain prediction results. The results indicate that using introduction, results and discussion is most appropriate for assessing the novelty of a paper, while the use of the entire text does not yield significant results. Furthermore, based on the results of the PLMs and LLMs, the introduction and results appear to be the most important section for the task of novelty score prediction. The code and dataset for this paper can be accessed at https://github.com/njust-winchy/SC4ANM.

<title>Embodied Agents Meet Personalization: Exploring Memory Utilization for Personalized Assistance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16348</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in household object rearrangement tasks. However, these tasks primarily focus on single-turn interactions with simplified instructions, which do not truly reflect the challenges of providing meaningful assistance to users. To provide personalized assistance, embodied agents must understand the unique semantics that users assign to the physical world (e.g., favorite cup, breakfast routine) by leveraging prior interaction history to interpret dynamic, real-world instructions. Yet, the effectiveness of embodied agents in utilizing memory for personalized assistance remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we present MEMENTO, a personalized embodied agent evaluation framework designed to comprehensively assess memory utilization capabilities to provide personalized assistance. Our framework consists of a two-stage memory evaluation process design that enables quantifying the impact of memory utilization on task performance. This process enables the evaluation of agents' understanding of personalized knowledge in object rearrangement tasks by focusing on its role in goal interpretation: (1) the ability to identify target objects based on personal meaning (object semantics), and (2) the ability to infer object-location configurations from consistent user patterns, such as routines (user patterns). Our experiments across various LLMs reveal significant limitations in memory utilization, with even frontier models like GPT-4o experiencing a 30.5% performance drop when required to reference multiple memories, particularly in tasks involving user patterns. These findings, along with our detailed analyses and case studies, provide valuable insights for future research in developing more effective personalized embodied agents.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly difficult for researchers to stay updated and synthesize knowledge effectively. This paper presents XSum, a modular pipeline for multi-document summarization (MDS) in the scientific domain using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The pipeline includes two core components: a question-generation module and an editor module. The question-generation module dynamically generates questions adapted to the input papers, ensuring the retrieval of relevant and accurate information. The editor module synthesizes the retrieved content into coherent and well-structured summaries that adhere to academic standards for proper citation. Evaluated on the SurveySum dataset, XSum demonstrates strong performance, achieving considerable improvements in metrics such as CheckEval, G-Eval and Ref-F1 compared to existing approaches. This work provides a transparent, adaptable framework for scientific summarization with potential applications in a wide range of domains. Code available at https://github.com/webis-de/scolia25-xsum

<title>PaTH Attention: Position Encoding via Accumulating Householder Transformations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16381</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models (LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant, position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.
  This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm that minimizes I/O cost. Across both targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling experiments, we find that PaTH demonstrates superior performance compared to RoPE and other recent baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability in cross-lingual tasks. Understanding how LLMs acquire this ability is crucial for their interpretability. To quantify the cross-lingual ability of LLMs accurately, we propose a Word-Level Cross-Lingual Translation Task. To find how LLMs learn cross-lingual ability, we trace the outputs of LLMs' intermediate layers in the word translation task. We identify and distinguish two distinct behaviors in the forward pass of LLMs: co-occurrence behavior and semantic pivot behavior. We attribute LLMs' two distinct behaviors to the co-occurrence frequency of words and find the semantic pivot from the pre-training dataset. Finally, to apply our findings to improve the cross-lingual ability of LLMs, we reconstruct a semantic pivot-aware pre-training dataset using documents with a high proportion of semantic pivots. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing cross-lingual ability. Our research contributes insights into the interpretability of LLMs and offers a method for improving LLMs' cross-lingual ability.

<title>Resource for Error Analysis in Text Simplification: New Taxonomy and Test Collection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general public often encounters complex texts but does not have the time or expertise to fully understand them, leading to the spread of misinformation. Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) helps make information more accessible, but its evaluation methods have not kept up with advances in text generation, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, recent studies have shown that current ATS metrics do not correlate with the presence of errors. Manual inspections have further revealed a variety of errors, underscoring the need for a more nuanced evaluation framework, which is currently lacking. This resource paper addresses this gap by introducing a test collection for detecting and classifying errors in simplified texts. First, we propose a taxonomy of errors, with a formal focus on information distortion. Next, we introduce a parallel dataset of automatically simplified scientific texts. This dataset has been human-annotated with labels based on our proposed taxonomy. Finally, we analyze the quality of the dataset, and we study the performance of existing models to detect and classify errors from that taxonomy. These contributions give researchers the tools to better evaluate errors in ATS, develop more reliable models, and ultimately improve the quality of automatically simplified texts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the capabilities of large-scale pre-trained models evolve, understanding the determinants of their outputs becomes more important. Feature attribution aims to reveal which parts of the input elements contribute the most to model outputs. In speech processing, the unique characteristics of the input signal make the application of feature attribution methods challenging. We study how factors such as input type and aggregation and perturbation timespan impact the reliability of standard feature attribution methods, and how these factors interact with characteristics of each classification task. We find that standard approaches to feature attribution are generally unreliable when applied to the speech domain, with the exception of word-aligned perturbation methods when applied to word-based classification tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting cultural values in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, particularly due to biases and limited training data. Prior work primarily aligns LLMs with different cultural values using World Values Survey (WVS) data. However, it remains unclear whether this approach effectively captures cultural nuances or produces distinct cultural representations for various downstream tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate WVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and find that relying solely on survey data can homogenize cultural norms and interfere with factual knowledge. To investigate these issues, we augment WVS with encyclopedic and scenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd. While these narratives may have variable effects on downstream tasks, they consistently improve cultural distinctiveness than survey data alone. Our work highlights the inherent complexity of aligning cultural values with the goal of guiding task-specific behavior.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training. To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star. The code is available at https://github.com/dongguanting/Tool-Star.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models.

Abstract: In natural language generation for advertising, creating diverse and engaging ad texts is crucial for capturing a broad audience and avoiding advertising fatigue. Regardless of the importance of diversity, the impact of the diversity-enhancing methods in ad text generation -- mainly tested on tasks such as summarization and machine translation -- has not been thoroughly explored. Ad text generation significantly differs from these tasks owing to the text style and requirements. This research explores the relationship between diversity and ad quality in ad text generation by considering multiple factors, such as diversity-enhancing methods, their hyperparameters, input-output formats, and the models.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to 44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.

Abstract: The effective communication of procedural knowledge remains a significant challenge in natural language processing (NLP), as purely textual instructions often fail to convey complex physical actions and spatial relationships. We address this limitation by proposing a language-driven framework that translates procedural text into coherent visual instructions. Our approach models the linguistic structure of instructional content by decomposing it into goal statements and sequential steps, then conditioning visual generation on these linguistic elements. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a constituency parser-based text encoding mechanism that preserves semantic completeness even with lengthy instructions, (2) a pairwise discourse coherence model that maintains consistency across instruction sequences, and (3) a novel evaluation protocol specifically designed for procedural language-to-image alignment. Our experiments across three instructional datasets (HTStep, CaptainCook4D, and WikiAll) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in generating visuals that accurately reflect the linguistic content and sequential nature of instructions. This work contributes to the growing body of research on grounding procedural language in visual content, with applications spanning education, task guidance, and multimodal language understanding.

Abstract: Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews, purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem. High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution, establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems research.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for SemEval 2025 Task 11 Track A, focusing on multilabel emotion classification across 28 languages. We explore two main strategies: fully fine-tuning transformer models and classifier-only training, evaluating different settings such as fine-tuning strategies, model architectures, loss functions, encoders, and classifiers. Our findings suggest that training a classifier on top of prompt-based encoders such as mE5 and BGE yields significantly better results than fully fine-tuning XLMR and mBERT. Our best-performing model on the final leaderboard is an ensemble combining multiple BGE models, where CatBoost serves as the classifier, with different configurations. This ensemble achieves an average F1-macro score of 56.58 across all languages.

<title>Reading Between the Prompts: How Stereotypes Shape LLM's Implicit Personalization</title>

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user's demographic information from subtle cues in the conversation -- a phenomenon called implicit personalization. Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic conversations, by analyzing the models' latent user representations through both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs represent user identity.

<title>Teaching Large Language Models to Maintain Contextual Faithfulness via Synthetic Tasks and Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in both short-form and long-form generation tasks without human annotations. Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different downstream tasks, even outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

<title>LLaMAs Have Feelings Too: Unveiling Sentiment and Emotion Representations in LLaMA Models Through Probing</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become central to NLP, demonstrating their ability to adapt to various tasks through prompting techniques, including sentiment analysis. However, we still have a limited understanding of how these models capture sentiment-related information. This study probes the hidden layers of Llama models to pinpoint where sentiment features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment analysis.
  Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to 14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%.
  These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs, suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory requirements.

Abstract: Complex narrative contexts often challenge language models' ability to follow instructions, and existing benchmarks fail to capture these difficulties. To address this, we propose Concise-SAE, a training-free framework that improves instruction following by identifying and editing instruction-relevant neurons using only natural language instructions, without requiring labelled data. To thoroughly evaluate our method, we introduce FreeInstruct, a diverse and realistic benchmark of 1,212 examples that highlights the challenges of instruction following in narrative-rich settings. While initially motivated by complex narratives, Concise-SAE demonstrates state-of-the-art instruction adherence across varied tasks without compromising generation quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in LegalAI have primarily focused on individual case judgment analysis, often overlooking the critical appellate process within the judicial system. Appeals serve as a core mechanism for error correction and ensuring fair trials, making them highly significant both in practice and in research. To address this gap, we present the AppealCase dataset, consisting of 10,000 pairs of real-world, matched first-instance and second-instance documents across 91 categories of civil cases. The dataset also includes detailed annotations along five dimensions central to appellate review: judgment reversals, reversal reasons, cited legal provisions, claim-level decisions, and whether there is new information in the second instance. Based on these annotations, we propose five novel LegalAI tasks and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 20 mainstream models. Experimental results reveal that all current models achieve less than 50% F1 scores on the judgment reversal prediction task, highlighting the complexity and challenge of the appeal scenario. We hope that the AppealCase dataset will spur further research in LegalAI for appellate case analysis and contribute to improving consistency in judicial decision-making.

<title>CUB: Benchmarking Context Utilisation Techniques for Language Models</title>

Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks, such as question answering and fact checking. However, language models (LMs) may ignore relevant information that contradicts outdated parametric memory or be distracted by irrelevant contexts. While many context utilisation manipulation techniques (CMTs) that encourage or suppress context utilisation have recently been proposed to alleviate these issues, few have seen systematic comparison. In this paper, we develop CUB (Context Utilisation Benchmark) to help practitioners within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) identify the best CMT for their needs. CUB allows for rigorous testing on three distinct context types, observed to capture key challenges in realistic context utilisation scenarios. With this benchmark, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art methods, representative of the main categories of CMTs, across three diverse datasets and tasks, applied to nine LMs. Our results show that most of the existing CMTs struggle to handle the full set of types of contexts that may be encountered in real-world retrieval-augmented scenarios. Moreover, we find that many CMTs display an inflated performance on simple synthesised datasets, compared to more realistic datasets with naturally occurring samples. Altogether, our results show the need for holistic tests of CMTs and the development of CMTs that can handle multiple context types.

<title>Are the Hidden States Hiding Something? Testing the Limits of Factuality-Encoding Capabilities in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness. However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism, which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to LLM-generated datasets remains challenging. This study lays the groundwork for future research on factuality in LLMs and offers practical guidelines for more effective evaluation.

<title>Benchmarking and Pushing the Multi-Bias Elimination Boundary of LLMs via Causal Effect Estimation-guided Debiasing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16522</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies have indicated that current large language models (LLMs) may still utilize bias during inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. Some benchmarks are proposed to investigate the generalizability of LLMs, with each piece of data typically containing one type of controlled bias. However, a single piece of data may contain multiple types of biases in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-bias benchmark where each piece of data contains five types of biases. The evaluations conducted on this benchmark reveal that the performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods is unsatisfying, highlighting the challenge of eliminating multiple types of biases simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we propose a causal effect estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE). This method first estimates the causal effect of multiple types of biases simultaneously. Subsequently, we eliminate the causal effect of biases from the total causal effect exerted by both the semantic information and biases during inference. Experimental results show that CMBE can effectively eliminate multiple types of bias simultaneously to enhance the generalizability of LLMs.

<title>EnSToM: Enhancing Dialogue Systems with Entropy-Scaled Steering Vectors for Topic Maintenance</title>

Abstract: Small large language models (sLLMs) offer the advantage of being lightweight and efficient, which makes them suitable for resource-constrained environments. However, sLLMs often struggle to maintain topic consistency in task-oriented dialogue systems, which is critical for scenarios such as service chatbots. Specifically, it is important to ensure that the model denies off-topic or malicious inputs and adheres to its intended functionality so as to prevent potential misuse and uphold reliability. Towards this, existing activation engineering approaches have been proposed to manipulate internal activations during inference. While these methods are effective in certain scenarios, our preliminary experiments reveal their limitations in ensuring topic adherence. Therefore, to address this, we propose a novel approach termed Entropy-scaled Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance (EnSToM). EnSToM dynamically adjusts the steering intensity based on input uncertainty, which allows the model to handle off-topic distractors effectively while preserving on-topic accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that EnSToM achieves significant performance gain with a relatively small data size compared to fine-tuning approaches. By improving topic adherence without compromising efficiency, our approach provides a robust solution for enhancing sLLM-based dialogue systems.

<title>Mechanistic Understanding and Mitigation of Language Confusion in English-Centric Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Language confusion -- where large language models (LLMs) generate unintended languages against the user's need -- remains a critical challenge, especially for English-centric models. We present the first mechanistic interpretability (MI) study of language confusion, combining behavioral benchmarking with neuron-level analysis. Using the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB), we show that confusion points (CPs) -- specific positions where language switches occur -- are central to this phenomenon. Through layer-wise analysis with TunedLens and targeted neuron attribution, we reveal that transition failures in the final layers drive confusion. We further demonstrate that editing a small set of critical neurons, identified via comparative analysis with multilingual-tuned models, substantially mitigates confusion without harming general competence or fluency. Our approach matches multilingual alignment in confusion reduction for most languages and yields cleaner, higher-quality outputs. These findings provide new insights into the internal dynamics of LLMs and highlight neuron-level interventions as a promising direction for robust, interpretable multilingual language modeling.

<title>Think Silently, Think Fast: Dynamic Latent Compression of LLM Reasoning Chains</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Prior benchmarks for evaluating the domain-specific knowledge of large language models (LLMs) lack the scalability to handle complex academic tasks. To address this, we introduce \texttt{ScholarBench}, a benchmark centered on deep expert knowledge and complex academic problem-solving, which evaluates the academic reasoning ability of LLMs and is constructed through a three-step process. \texttt{ScholarBench} targets more specialized and logically complex contexts derived from academic literature, encompassing five distinct problem types. Unlike prior benchmarks, \texttt{ScholarBench} evaluates the abstraction, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs across eight distinct research domains. To ensure high-quality evaluation data, we define category-specific example attributes and design questions that are aligned with the characteristic research methodologies and discourse structures of each domain. Additionally, this benchmark operates as an English-Korean bilingual dataset, facilitating simultaneous evaluation for linguistic capabilities of LLMs in both languages. The benchmark comprises 5,031 examples in Korean and 5,309 in English, with even state-of-the-art models like o3-mini achieving an average evaluation score of only 0.543, demonstrating the challenging nature of this benchmark.

<title>URLs Help, Topics Guide: Understanding Metadata Utility in LLM Training</title>

arXiv:2505.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly pretrained on vast corpora of text without utilizing contextual metadata such as source, quality, or topic, leading to a context-free learning paradigm. While recent studies suggest that adding metadata like URL information as context (i.e., auxiliary inputs not used in the loss calculation) can improve training efficiency and downstream performance, they offer limited understanding of which types of metadata are truly effective and under what conditions. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation and find that not all metadata types contribute equally. Only URL context speeds up training, whereas quality scores and topic/format domain information offer no clear benefit. Furthermore, the improved downstream performances of URL conditioning emerge only when longer prompts are used at inference time. In addition, we demonstrate that context-aware pretraining enables more controllable generation than context-free pretraining, in a classifier-free guidance fashion. Although topic and format metadata do not accelerate training, they are effective for steering outputs, offering human-interpretable control over generation.

<div> Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark, counterfactual edits, temporal edits, token-level evaluation, text-level evaluation

Summary: 
The article discusses the topic of Knowledge Editing (KE) and introduces a new script-based benchmark called ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark). This benchmark evaluates KE methods in real-world application scenarios and includes both counterfactual and temporal edits. It integrates token-level and text-level evaluation methods, providing a comprehensive analysis of existing KE techniques. The benchmark expands evaluation beyond fact-based questions to include action-based questions, revealing a drop in performance for all KE methods on established metrics. Text-level evaluation poses challenges for KE methods, highlighting the complexity of the task. The ScEdit benchmark is publicly available on GitHub for further research and development in the field of Knowledge Editing. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection. However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g., recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) -- which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based ("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question) evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a challenging task. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/asdfo123/ScEdit.

<div> Keywords: agents, environments, SynWorld, action space, Monte Carlo Tree Search

Summary: 
Agents interact with environments by planning and executing actions to expand their capabilities. However, LLM-based agents can struggle in new or unconventional environments. To address this, the SynWorld framework enables agents to explore environments autonomously by synthesizing scenarios with multi-step action invocation and using Monte Carlo Tree Search. This approach helps agents optimize workflows, enhance their understanding of actions, and refine their action knowledge effectively. Experimental results show that SynWorld is a versatile method for learning action knowledge in novel environments. The code for SynWorld is available on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/SynWorld. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In the interaction between agents and their environments, agents expand their capabilities by planning and executing actions. However, LLM-based agents face substantial challenges when deployed in novel environments or required to navigate unconventional action spaces. To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/SynWorld.

Abstract: The development of high-performing, robust, and reliable speech technologies depends on large, high-quality datasets. However, African languages -- including our focus, Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba -- remain under-represented due to insufficient data. Popular voice-enabled technologies do not support any of the 2000+ African languages, limiting accessibility for circa one billion people. While previous dataset efforts exist for the target languages, they lack the scale and diversity needed for robust speech models. To bridge this gap, we introduce the NaijaVoices dataset, a 1,800-hour speech-text dataset with 5,000+ speakers. We outline our unique data collection approach, analyze its acoustic diversity, and demonstrate its impact through finetuning experiments on automatic speech recognition, averagely achieving 75.86% (Whisper), 52.06% (MMS), and 42.33% (XLSR) WER improvements. These results highlight NaijaVoices' potential to advance multilingual speech processing for African languages.

<div> perception accuracy, reasoning length, hallucination, multimodal tasks, attention analysis

Summary:<br /><br /> The study explores the trade-off between reasoning ability and perceptual fidelity in multimodal large language models. Longer reasoning chains in these models lead to increased hallucination, as they drift away from image-grounded content and rely more on language priors. The RH-AUC metric quantifies how model perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, revealing that larger models achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception. The study introduces RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for multimodal tasks, to assess this trade-off. It is found that the balance between reasoning and perception is influenced more by the types and domains of training data rather than its volume. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluation frameworks that consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

Summary: 
The article introduces RedTeamCUA, an adversarial testing framework that combines a VM-based OS environment with Docker-based web platforms to evaluate computer-use agents (CUAs) for potential vulnerabilities related to indirect prompt injection. The framework allows for flexible adversarial scenario configuration and bypasses navigational limitations of CUAs by initiating tests directly at the point of an adversarial injection. Through the development of RTC-Bench, a benchmark with 864 examples, the study identifies significant vulnerabilities in current CUAs, with ASRs ranging from 7.6% to 50%. The results show that even advanced CUAs are susceptible to indirect prompt injection, highlighting the need for robust defenses in the face of realistic hybrid web-OS attack scenarios. RedTeamCUA provides a crucial tool for comprehensive analysis of CUA vulnerabilities and emphasizes the importance of addressing these risks before real-world deployment. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) promise to automate complex tasks across operating systems (OS) and the web, but remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection. Current evaluations of this threat either lack support realistic but controlled environments or ignore hybrid web-OS attack scenarios involving both interfaces. To address this, we propose RedTeamCUA, an adversarial testing framework featuring a novel hybrid sandbox that integrates a VM-based OS environment with Docker-based web platforms. Our sandbox supports key features tailored for red teaming, such as flexible adversarial scenario configuration, and a setting that decouples adversarial evaluation from navigational limitations of CUAs by initializing tests directly at the point of an adversarial injection. Using RedTeamCUA, we develop RTC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with 864 examples that investigate realistic, hybrid web-OS attack scenarios and fundamental security vulnerabilities. Benchmarking current frontier CUAs identifies significant vulnerabilities: Claude 3.7 Sonnet | CUA demonstrates an ASR of 42.9%, while Operator, the most secure CUA evaluated, still exhibits an ASR of 7.6%. Notably, CUAs often attempt to execute adversarial tasks with an Attempt Rate as high as 92.5%, although failing to complete them due to capability limitations. Nevertheless, we observe concerning ASRs of up to 50% in realistic end-to-end settings, with the recently released frontier Claude 4 Opus | CUA showing an alarming ASR of 48%, demonstrating that indirect prompt injection presents tangible risks for even advanced CUAs despite their capabilities and safeguards. Overall, RedTeamCUA provides an essential framework for advancing realistic, controlled, and systematic analysis of CUA vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses to indirect prompt injection prior to real-world deployment.

Abstract: Evaluating tables qualitatively and quantitatively poses a significant challenge, as standard metrics often overlook subtle structural and content-level discrepancies. To address this, we propose a rubric-based evaluation framework that integrates multi-level structural descriptors with fine-grained contextual signals, enabling more precise and consistent table comparison. Building on this, we introduce TabXEval, an eXhaustive and eXplainable two-phase evaluation framework. TabXEval first aligns reference and predicted tables structurally via TabAlign, then performs semantic and syntactic comparison using TabCompare, offering interpretable and granular feedback. We evaluate TabXEval on TabXBench, a diverse, multi-domain benchmark featuring realistic table perturbations and human annotations. A sensitivity-specificity analysis further demonstrates the robustness and explainability of TabXEval across varied table tasks.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a systematic approach, JQL, for curating high-quality multilingual training data for large language models, efficiently reducing computational demands. Using lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings, the approach improves cross-lingual transferability and scalability. JQL's annotation pipeline outperforms heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2 across 35 languages, enhancing downstream model training quality and data retention rates. This research raises the standards for multilingual dataset development by providing practical insights and valuable resources. <div>

Abstract: High-quality multilingual training data is essential for effectively pretraining large language models (LLMs). Yet, the availability of suitable open-source multilingual datasets remains limited. Existing state-of-the-art datasets mostly rely on heuristic filtering methods, restricting both their cross-lingual transferability and scalability. Here, we introduce JQL, a systematic approach that efficiently curates diverse and high-quality multilingual data at scale while significantly reducing computational demands. JQL distills LLMs' annotation capabilities into lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings. These models exhibit robust multilingual and cross-lingual performance, even for languages and scripts unseen during training. Evaluated empirically across 35 languages, the resulting annotation pipeline substantially outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2. JQL notably enhances downstream model training quality and increases data retention rates. Our research provides practical insights and valuable resources for multilingual data curation, raising the standards of multilingual dataset development.

Summary:
Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) is an AI-in-the-loop methodology aimed at optimizing human annotation efforts for vision-language alignment. It leverages sequential annotation to reduce redundant workload by having subsequent annotators focus only on missing visual information. By utilizing a multimodal interface that allows annotators to read and talk simultaneously, CoTalk increases annotation speed and improves the comprehensiveness of annotated samples. Intrinsic evaluations show the effectiveness of CoTalk in producing comprehensive semantic units, while extrinsic evaluations demonstrate its practical utility in aiding vision-language alignment. Experiments with participants have shown that CoTalk leads to faster annotation speeds and better retrieval performance compared to conventional parallel annotation methods. This innovative framework has the potential to maximize the number of annotated samples and enhance their quality within fixed budget constraints.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While densely annotated image captions significantly facilitate the learning of robust vision-language alignment, methodologies for systematically optimizing human annotation efforts remain underexplored. We introduce Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk), an AI-in-the-loop methodology designed to maximize the number of annotated samples and improve their comprehensiveness under fixed budget constraints (e.g., total human annotation time). The framework is built upon two key insights. First, sequential annotation reduces redundant workload compared to conventional parallel annotation, as subsequent annotators only need to annotate the ``residual'' -- the missing visual information that previous annotations have not covered. Second, humans process textual input faster by reading while outputting annotations with much higher throughput via talking; thus a multimodal interface enables optimized efficiency. We evaluate our framework from two aspects: intrinsic evaluations that assess the comprehensiveness of semantic units, obtained by parsing detailed captions into object-attribute trees and analyzing their effective connections; extrinsic evaluation measures the practical usage of the annotated captions in facilitating vision-language alignment. Experiments with eight participants show our Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) improves annotation speed (0.42 vs. 0.30 units/sec) and retrieval performance (41.13% vs. 40.52%) over the parallel method.

Summary:<br /><br />Recent research has focused on improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. While current methods operate at the token level, LLMs still experience hallucinations, particularly in longer contexts. To address this, Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD) is introduced as a novel decoding strategy that actively determines when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By treating decoding as a sequential decision-making process, ActLCD uses reinforcement learning to optimize factuality beyond individual tokens. Experimental results demonstrate ActLCD outperforms existing techniques across multiple benchmarks, proving its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations in various generation scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the challenges of aligning large language models with human preferences, highlighting the multifaceted nature of preference feedback. It introduces SITAlign, a framework that implements the concept of satisficing alignment by optimizing a primary objective while satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. Drawing from research on bounded rationality, which suggests humans follow satisficing strategies in decision-making, the framework aims to reflect how humans actually make decisions. The theoretical analysis includes sub-optimality bounds for the satisficing-based inference alignment approach. Empirical validation on various benchmarks shows that SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective decoding strategy, demonstrating superior performance in maximizing helpfulness while adhering to harmlessness thresholds. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4 win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on harmlessness.

AdvAgent is a black-box red-teaming framework designed to attack web agents by optimizing adversarial prompts using reinforcement learning. The framework leverages a reinforcement learning-based pipeline to train an adversarial prompter model, effectively exploiting vulnerabilities in web agents while maintaining stealthiness and controllability. Extensive evaluations show that AdvAgent achieves high success rates against state-of-the-art GPT-4-based web agents across diverse web tasks. The framework highlights critical vulnerabilities in current web agents and emphasizes the need for stronger defense mechanisms. Existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection against the attacks launched by AdvAgent. The researchers have released the code for AdvAgent, allowing for further exploration and potentially improving defense mechanisms against such attacks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2410.17401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation model-based agents are increasingly used to automate complex tasks, enhancing efficiency and productivity. However, their access to sensitive resources and autonomous decision-making also introduce significant security risks, where successful attacks could lead to severe consequences. To systematically uncover these vulnerabilities, we propose AdvAgent, a black-box red-teaming framework for attacking web agents. Unlike existing approaches, AdvAgent employs a reinforcement learning-based pipeline to train an adversarial prompter model that optimizes adversarial prompts using feedback from the black-box agent. With careful attack design, these prompts effectively exploit agent weaknesses while maintaining stealthiness and controllability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AdvAgent achieves high success rates against state-of-the-art GPT-4-based web agents across diverse web tasks. Furthermore, we find that existing prompt-based defenses provide only limited protection, leaving agents vulnerable to our framework. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current web agents and emphasize the urgent need for stronger defense mechanisms. We release code at https://ai-secure.github.io/AdvAgent/.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, pruning, regional gradients, perplexity improvement, lightweight approach

Summary:
The article introduces Wanda++, a new pruning framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that utilizes decoder-block-level regional gradients to enhance the pruning process. By incorporating regional gradients for the first time, Wanda++ effectively minimizes output discrepancies between dense and sparse decoder outputs, resulting in improved accuracy without the need for full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. In language modeling tasks, Wanda++ surpasses existing methods by up to a 32% improvement in perplexity and demonstrates strong generalization to downstream tasks. Despite its regional optimization approach, Wanda++ remains compatible with sparsity-aware fine-tuning techniques like LoRA, further reducing perplexity to a great extent. This lightweight framework can prune a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single H100 GPU, making it efficient for practical usage. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2503.04992v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal accuracy impact. However, existing methods often suffer from accuracy degradation without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Moreover, despite updating weights with regional optimization, Wanda++ remains orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, further reducing perplexity with LoRA in great extend. Our approach is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single H100 GPU.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence Curation (HiREC) framework to address the issue of duplicate retrieval in standardized financial documents. By performing hierarchical retrieval and evidence curation, HiREC reduces confusion among similar texts and selects relevant passages while removing irrelevant ones. The framework also generates complementary queries to gather missing information. To evaluate the approach, the authors introduce a Large-scale Open-domain Financial (LOFin) question answering benchmark consisting of SEC documents and question-answer pairs. The benchmark aims to improve accuracy and completeness in knowledge-intensive tasks utilizing large language models in the finance domain. The code and data for LOFin are publicly available on GitHub, offering a valuable resource for further research in this area. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based large language models (LLMs) are widely used in finance for their excellent performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, standardized documents (e.g., SEC filing) share similar formats such as repetitive boilerplate texts, and similar table structures. This similarity forces traditional RAG methods to misidentify near-duplicate text, leading to duplicate retrieval that undermines accuracy and completeness. To address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence Curation (HiREC) framework. Our approach first performs hierarchical retrieval to reduce confusion among similar texts. It first retrieve related documents and then selects the most relevant passages from the documents. The evidence curation process removes irrelevant passages. When necessary, it automatically generates complementary queries to collect missing information. To evaluate our approach, we construct and release a Large-scale Open-domain Financial (LOFin) question answering benchmark that includes 145,897 SEC documents and 1,595 question-answer pairs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/deep-over/LOFin-bench-HiREC.

<div> Variable binding, symbolic computation, neural networks, dereferencing, attention<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This study explores how a Transformer model can acquire the ability to handle variable bindings in symbolic programs without explicit architectural support. Through training on programs with variable assignments and chains of dependencies, the model goes through three training phases: random prediction, heuristic prioritization, and systematic dereferencing. By analyzing causal interventions, the researchers find that the model leverages residual streams as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the model to track variable bindings across layers, enabling accurate dereferencing. The results demonstrate how Transformer models can learn to implement systematic variable binding, bridging the gap between connectionist and symbolic approaches.

Abstract: Variable binding -- the ability to associate variables with values -- is fundamental to symbolic computation and cognition. Although classical architectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it is not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding operations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a Transformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where variables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each program requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep to find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments acting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with three distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical constants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and (3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment chains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit the residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in accurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to implement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support, bridging connectionist and symbolic approaches. To facilitate reproducible research, we developed Variable Scope, an interactive web platform for exploring our findings at https://variablescope.org

<div> CLIP, DCLIP, multimodal retrieval, fine-tuned, image-text<br />
Summary:<br />
Distill CLIP (DCLIP) is a variant of the CLIP model designed to improve image-text retrieval while maintaining strong zero-shot classification abilities. DCLIP uses a meta teacher-student distillation approach, where a cross-modal transformer teacher is fine-tuned to generate enhanced embeddings through bidirectional cross-attention between image regions and text. By training on a smaller dataset, DCLIP significantly enhances retrieval metrics and retains most of CLIP's classification performance. This approach effectively balances task specialization and generalization, offering a resource-efficient solution for advanced vision-language tasks.<br /> <div>

Abstract: We present Distill CLIP (DCLIP), a fine-tuned variant of the CLIP model that enhances multimodal image-text retrieval while preserving the original model's strong zero-shot classification capabilities. CLIP models are typically constrained by fixed image resolutions and limited context, which can hinder their effectiveness in retrieval tasks that require fine-grained cross-modal understanding. DCLIP addresses these challenges through a meta teacher-student distillation framework, where a cross-modal transformer teacher is fine-tuned to produce enriched embeddings via bidirectional cross-attention between YOLO-extracted image regions and corresponding textual spans. These semantically and spatially aligned global representations guide the training of a lightweight student model using a hybrid loss that combines contrastive learning and cosine similarity objectives. Despite being trained on only ~67,500 samples curated from MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and Conceptual Captions-just a fraction of CLIP's original dataset-DCLIP significantly improves image-text retrieval metrics (Recall@K, MAP), while retaining approximately 94% of CLIP's zero-shot classification performance. These results demonstrate that DCLIP effectively mitigates the trade-off between task specialization and generalization, offering a resource-efficient, domain-adaptive, and detail-sensitive solution for advanced vision-language tasks.

Abstract: AI copilots represent a new generation of AI-powered systems designed to assist users, particularly knowledge workers and developers, in complex, context-rich tasks. As these systems become more embedded in daily workflows, personalization has emerged as a critical factor for improving usability, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Central to this personalization is preference optimization: the system's ability to detect, interpret, and align with individual user preferences. While prior work in intelligent assistants and optimization algorithms is extensive, their intersection within AI copilots remains underexplored. This survey addresses that gap by examining how user preferences are operationalized in AI copilots. We investigate how preference signals are sourced, modeled across different interaction stages, and refined through feedback loops. Building on a comprehensive literature review, we define the concept of an AI copilot and introduce a taxonomy of preference optimization techniques across pre-, mid-, and post-interaction phases. Each technique is evaluated in terms of advantages, limitations, and design implications. By consolidating fragmented efforts across AI personalization, human-AI interaction, and language model adaptation, this work offers both a unified conceptual foundation and a practical design perspective for building user-aligned, persona-aware AI copilots that support end-to-end adaptability and deployment.

arXiv:2505.23419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and data contamination. In this work, we present SWE-bench-Live, a live-updatable benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is \method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy, we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous, contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world software development settings.

<div> Keywords: rule-based reinforcement learning, multimodal large language models, jigsaw puzzles, generalization, visual tasks

Summary: 
Firstly, multimodal large language models show significant improvement in jigsaw puzzle solving through fine-tuning. They can achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize well to complex configurations. Secondly, training on jigsaw puzzles can lead to generalization on other visual tasks, depending on the task configurations. Thirdly, MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, but there may be a tendency to favor direct answering in open-source models. Complex reasoning patterns seem to be pre-existing rather than emergent, increasing in frequency with training and task difficulty. Finally, rule-based reinforcement learning exhibits more effective generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning, but an initial cold start phase with SFT may hinder subsequent optimization in RL. Overall, this study sheds light on the unique challenges and potential in rule-based visual RL in multimodal learning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile, physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue. Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the field of physics.

Summary:
This study examines the effectiveness of Process Reward Models (PRMs) in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. The analysis considers various perspectives such as training methodologies, scalability, and generalization capabilities. The findings suggest that there is a diminishing return in performance as the PRM scale increases, highlighting the importance of balancing model size and computational cost. The diversity of training datasets significantly impacts PRM performance, emphasizing the need for varied data. Test-time scaling strategies, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Best-of-N Sampling, are identified as effective methods based on available computational resources. PRMs trained on mathematical datasets show comparable performance to those trained for code generation, indicating robust cross-domain generalization. Additionally, the study reveals that PRMs have a preference for selecting responses with similar underlying patterns, providing insights for optimization. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models have underscored the efficacy of Process Reward Models (PRMs) in addressing intermediate errors through structured feedback mechanisms. This study analyzes PRMs from multiple perspectives, including training methodologies, scalability, and generalization capabilities. We investigate the interplay between pre-training and reward model training FLOPs to assess their influence on PRM efficiency and accuracy in complex reasoning tasks. Our analysis reveals a pattern of diminishing returns in performance with increasing PRM scale, highlighting the importance of balancing model size and computational cost. Furthermore, the diversity of training datasets significantly impacts PRM performance, emphasizing the importance of diverse data to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. We further examine test-time scaling strategies, identifying Monte Carlo Tree Search as the most effective method when computational resources are abundant, while Best-of-N Sampling serves as a practical alternative under resource-limited conditions. Notably, our findings indicate that PRMs trained on mathematical datasets exhibit performance comparable to those tailored for code generation, suggesting robust cross-domain generalization. Employing a gradient-based metric, we observe that PRMs exhibit a preference for selecting responses with similar underlying patterns, further informing their optimization.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Hierarchical Tool Error Checklist (HiTEC) framework to address parameter misfilling issues in large language models (LLMs) when calling external tools. This framework consists of a global error checklist for common issues and a local checklist for tool-specific failures. Two deployments are proposed: HiTEC-In Context Learning (HiTEC-ICL) and HiTEC-Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (HiTEC-KTO). HiTEC-ICL uses a conversational approach to refine parameter handling, while HiTEC-KTO generates negative examples for optimization. Experimental results on public datasets show that HiTEC significantly improves parameter-filling accuracy and tool-calling success rates compared to baseline methods. This framework offers a systematic way to diagnose and mitigate tool-calling errors without extensive real-world interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, particularly through the integration of external tools and APIs. However, their effectiveness is frequently hampered by parameter mis-filling during tool calling. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Tool Error Checklist (HiTEC) framework to systematically diagnose and mitigate tool-calling errors without relying on extensive real-world interactions. HiTEC introduces a two-tiered approach: a global error checklist that identifies common, cross-tool issues, and a local error checklist that targets tool-specific and contextual failures. Building on this structure, we propose two deployments: HiTEC-In Context Learning (HiTEC-ICL) and HiTEC-Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (HiTEC-KTO). HiTEC-ICL embeds the global checklist in the initial prompts and leverages a two-round conversational interaction to dynamically refine parameter handling, while HiTEC-KTO generates high-quality negative examples to drive fine-tuning via preference-based optimization. Extensive experiments across five public datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parameter-filling accuracy and tool-calling success rates compared to baseline methods.

Summary: 
The study introduces the Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT), a framework consisting of 58 techniques categorized into nine groups to identify subtle social influence in text. The researchers create the SITT dataset, a corpus of 746 dialogues annotated by 11 experts in Polish and translated into English. Five large language models (LLMs) are evaluated on their ability to recognize social influence techniques, with Claude 3.5 showing moderate success. However, the overall performance of LLMs is limited, especially for context-sensitive techniques. The study highlights the need for domain-specific fine-tuning and emphasizes the models' lack of sensitivity to nuanced linguistic cues. This work serves as a valuable resource for exploring how LLMs perceive and categorize social influence strategies in natural dialogues.

Abstract: In this work we present the Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT), a comprehensive framework of 58 empirically grounded techniques organized into nine categories, designed to detect subtle forms of social influence in textual content. We also investigate the LLMs ability to identify various forms of social influence. Building on interdisciplinary foundations, we construct the SITT dataset -- a 746-dialogue corpus annotated by 11 experts in Polish and translated into English -- to evaluate the ability of LLMs to identify these techniques. Using a hierarchical multi-label classification setup, we benchmark five LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama-3.1, Mixtral, and PLLuM. Our results show that while some models, notably Claude 3.5, achieved moderate success (F1 score = 0.45 for categories), overall performance of models remains limited, particularly for context-sensitive techniques. The findings demonstrate key limitations in current LLMs' sensitivity to nuanced linguistic cues and underscore the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning. This work contributes a novel resource and evaluation example for understanding how LLMs detect, classify, and potentially replicate strategies of social influence in natural dialogues.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in error handling. Current error-handling works are performed in a passive manner, with explicit error-handling instructions. However, in real-world scenarios, explicit error-handling instructions are usually unavailable. In this paper, our work identifies this challenge as how to conduct proactive error handling without explicit error handling instructions. To promote further research, this work introduces a new benchmark, termed Mis-prompt, consisting of four evaluation tasks, an error category taxonomy, and a new evaluation dataset. Furthermore, this work analyzes current LLMs' performance on the benchmark, and the experimental results reveal that current LLMs show poor performance on proactive error handling, and SFT on error handling instances improves LLMs' proactive error handling capabilities. The dataset will be publicly available.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal language models, reference words, possessive pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, perspective-taking

Summary: 
Multimodal language models (MLMs) were evaluated on their use of reference words compared to human performance. Three word classes - vocabulary words, possessive pronouns, and demonstrative pronouns - were tested, revealing that MLMs struggle with possessives and demonstratives due to limitations in perspective-taking and spatial reasoning. While MLMs showed improvement with prompt engineering on possessive use, they remained below human-level competence in using demonstrative pronouns. These findings highlight the challenges faced by current NLP systems in producing grammatical forms that require pragmatics and social cognition. This study contributes both theoretical and empirical evidence to the ongoing discussion about the capabilities of MLMs in understanding and producing human-like communication.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) increasingly communicate in human-like ways, yet their ability to use reference words remains largely overlooked despite their ubiquity in everyday communication. Our study addresses this gap by comparing human and MLM use of three word classes with increasing cognitive demands: vocabulary words, possessive pronouns (`mine' vs `yours'), and demonstrative pronouns (`this one' vs `that one'). Evaluating seven state-of-the-art MLMs against human participants, we observe a clear difficulty hierarchy: while MLMs approach human-level performance on the vocabulary task, they show substantial deficits with possessives and demonstratives. Our analysis reveals these difficulties stem from limitations in perspective-taking and spatial reasoning. Although prompt engineering improved model performance on possessive use, demonstrative use remained well below human-level competence. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that producing grammatical forms requiring pragmatics and social cognition remains a clear challenge in current NLP systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping public discourse, yet their politico-economic biases remain underexamined in non-Western and low-resource multilingual contexts. This paper presents a systematic analysis of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five low-resource languages spoken in Pakistan: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, and Pashto. We propose a novel framework that integrates an adapted Political Compass Test (PCT) with a multi-level framing analysis. Our method combines quantitative assessment of political orientation across economic (left-right) and social (libertarian-authoritarian) axes with qualitative analysis of framing through content, style, and emphasis. We further contextualize this analysis by aligning prompts with 11 key socio-political themes relevant to Pakistani society. Our results reveal that LLMs predominantly align with liberal-left values, echoing Western training data influences, but exhibit notable shifts toward authoritarian framing in regional languages, suggesting strong cultural modulation effects. We also identify consistent model-specific bias signatures and language-conditioned variations in ideological expression. These findings show the urgent need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing frameworks.

<div> benchmarks, large language models, multi-turn dialogue, contextual variations, performance degradation

Summary:<br />
- Popular benchmarks do not adequately assess large language models in multi-turn dialogue scenarios.
- A new set of benchmarks varying context volume and nature was introduced.
- LLM performance on multiple-choice questions can significantly decrease in multi-turn exchanges.
- Even highly capable models like GPT-4o may exhibit reduced accuracy.
- Performance differences between larger and smaller models are not always predictable.
- Strategic placement of the task description within context can improve accuracy significantly. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn dialogue and other sustained interactive scenarios, it is essential to understand how extended context affects their performance. Popular benchmarks, focusing primarily on single-turn question answering (QA) tasks, fail to capture the effects of multi-turn exchanges. To address this gap, we introduce a novel set of benchmarks that systematically vary the volume and nature of prior context. We evaluate multiple conventional LLMs, including GPT, Claude, and Gemini, across these benchmarks to measure their sensitivity to contextual variations. Our findings reveal that LLM performance on multiple-choice questions can degrade dramatically in multi-turn interactions, with performance drops as large as 73% for certain models. Even highly capable models such as GPT-4o exhibit up to a 32% decrease in accuracy. Notably, the relative performance of larger versus smaller models is not always predictable. Moreover, the strategic placement of the task description within the context can substantially mitigate performance drops, improving the accuracy by as much as a factor of 3.5. These findings underscore the need for robust strategies to design, evaluate, and mitigate context-related sensitivity in LLMs.

<br />Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools that can mimic human behavior and capabilities. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows LLMs to generate varied outputs based on their database contents, making them valuable for studying human behavior in social science research where large experiments are impractical. In this paper, the use of interacting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as an alternative to LLMs is explored. The study compares a simplified GMM model to experimental simulations of interacting LLMs, showing that interacting GMMs can capture dynamics similar to interacting LLMs. Key similarities and differences between the two models are investigated, highlighting the potential of GMMs in modeling complex interactions. The benefits, possible modifications, and future research directions for GMMs are also discussed. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a powerful tool with the ability to match human capabilities and behavior in many settings. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) further allows LLMs to generate diverse output depending on the contents of their RAG database. This motivates their use in the social sciences to study human behavior between individuals when large-scale experiments are infeasible. However, LLMs depend on complex, computationally expensive algorithms. In this paper, we introduce interacting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as an alternative to similar frameworks using LLMs. We compare a simplified model of GMMs to select experimental simulations of LLMs whose updating and response depend on feedback from other LLMs. We find that interacting GMMs capture important features of the dynamics in interacting LLMs, and we investigate key similarities and differences between interacting LLMs and GMMs. We conclude by discussing the benefits of Gaussian mixture models, potential modifications, and future research directions.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, refusal behaviors, COSMIC, steering directions, alignment conditions
Summary: 
The article introduces COSMIC, an automated framework for identifying viable steering directions and target layers in Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on specific refusal templates detectable in model outputs. COSMIC utilizes cosine similarity metrics for direction selection, achieving comparable steering performance to existing methods while being independent of model outputs. It can reliably identify refusal directions in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, steering them toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals. The framework demonstrates robustness across a wide range of alignment conditions, showcasing its ability to enhance the safety and behavior of LLMs without requiring assumptions about their refusal behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode behaviors such as refusal within their activation space, yet identifying these behaviors remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often rely on predefined refusal templates detectable in output tokens or require manual analysis. We introduce \textbf{COSMIC} (Cosine Similarity Metrics for Inversion of Concepts), an automated framework for direction selection that identifies viable steering directions and target layers using cosine similarity - entirely independent of model outputs. COSMIC achieves steering performance comparable to prior methods without requiring assumptions about a model's refusal behavior, such as the presence of specific refusal tokens. It reliably identifies refusal directions in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, and is capable of steering such models toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals, demonstrating robustness across a wide range of alignment conditions.

Code-switching is the practice of alternating between two or more languages within a conversation, presenting a challenge for Automatic Speech Recognition systems designed for single languages. To address this issue, LinguaMaster presents SwitchLingua, a diverse dataset featuring 420K code-switching textual samples in 12 languages and over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers across 18 countries and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds.

arXiv:2506.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-switching (CS) is the alternating use of two or more languages within a conversation or utterance, often influenced by social context and speaker identity. This linguistic phenomenon poses challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which are typically designed for a single language and struggle to handle multilingual inputs. The growing global demand for multilingual applications, including Code-Switching ASR (CSASR), Text-to-Speech (CSTTS), and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), highlights the inadequacy of existing monolingual datasets.
  Although some code-switching datasets exist, most are limited to bilingual mixing within homogeneous ethnic groups, leaving a critical need for a large-scale, diverse benchmark akin to ImageNet in computer vision.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LinguaMaster}, a multi-agent collaboration framework specifically designed for efficient and scalable multilingual data synthesis. Leveraging this framework, we curate \textbf{SwitchLingua}, the first large-scale multilingual and multi-ethnic code-switching dataset, including: (1) 420K CS textual samples across 12 languages, and (2) over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers representing 18 countries/regions and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds, based on the textual data. This dataset captures rich linguistic and cultural diversity, offering a foundational resource for advancing multilingual and multicultural research. Furthermore, to address the issue that existing ASR evaluation metrics lack sensitivity to code-switching scenarios, we propose the \textbf{Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER)}, a novel evaluation metric that incorporates semantic information, providing a more accurate and context-aware assessment of system performance.

Summary:  
Hallucination, the production of inaccurate or non-factual statements, remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs). Current classification-based methods struggle to detect non-factual information early in the output sequence, reducing reliability. To address this, a novel method called Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs) is proposed. It assesses statement truthfulness by capturing LLM dynamics in the latent space using neural differential equations (Neural DEs). The latent space sequence is then mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. Extensive experiments across datasets and LLMs show HD-NDEs' effectiveness, achieving a significant improvement in AUC-ROC on the True-False dataset compared to existing techniques. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable advancements, yet hallucination, where models produce inaccurate or non-factual statements, remains a significant challenge for real-world deployment. Although current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space. Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of HD-NDEs, especially, achieving over 14% improvement in AUC-ROC on the True-False dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Verifiable Rewards, Creative Writing, Generative Reward Model, Policy Optimization

Summary:
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been successful in tasks with objective ground-truth answers, but faces challenges in subjective tasks like creative writing. This paper introduces a new approach that bridges the gap between verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. The proposed method combines a pairwise Generative Reward Model (GenRM) based on writing principles with a Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. This allows for transforming subjective assessments into reliable rewards and enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise comparison during training. The approach aims to improve writing capabilities of large language models without supervised fine-tuning and shows resistance to reward hacking. Experimental results on writing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. This work opens up possibilities for a unified reward modeling framework in reinforcement learning for language tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning tasks with objective ground-truth answers, such as mathematics and code generation. However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences, which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable, verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based, reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework, thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm applicable across all language tasks.

It highlights the challenges faced when using large language models (LLMs), such as relying on superficial cues that can lead to inaccurate predictions. The study focuses on drug status extraction and reveals how mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely influence models to predict drug use where there is none, as well as uncovering gender disparities in model performance.

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDOH) extraction from clinical text is critical for downstream healthcare analytics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, they may rely on superficial cues leading to spurious predictions. Using the MIMIC portion of the SHAC (Social History Annotation Corpus) dataset and focusing on drug status extraction as a case study, we demonstrate that mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely induce models to predict current/past drug use where none is present, while also uncovering concerning gender disparities in model performance. We further evaluate mitigation strategies - such as prompt engineering and chain-of-thought reasoning - to reduce these false positives, providing insights into enhancing LLM reliability in health domains.

Abstract: Personalization is essential for question answering systems that are user-centric. Despite its importance, personalization in answer generation has been relatively underexplored. This is mainly due to lack of resources for training and evaluating personalized question answering systems. We address this gap by introducing LaMP-QA -- a benchmark designed for evaluating personalized long-form answer generation. The benchmark covers questions from three major categories: (1) Arts & Entertainment, (2) Lifestyle & Personal Development, and (3) Society & Culture, encompassing over 45 subcategories in total. To assess the quality and potential impact of the LaMP-QA benchmark for personalized question answering, we conduct comprehensive human and automatic evaluations, to compare multiple evaluation strategies for evaluating generated personalized responses and measure their alignment with human preferences. Furthermore, we benchmark a number of non-personalized and personalized approaches based on open-source and proprietary large language models (LLMs). Our results show that incorporating the personalized context provided leads to performance improvements of up to 39%. The benchmark is publicly released to support future research in this area.

Abstract: Sanskrit, an ancient language with a rich linguistic heritage, presents unique challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to its phonemic complexity and the phonetic transformations that occur at word junctures, similar to the connected speech found in natural conversations. Due to these complexities, there has been limited exploration of ASR in Sanskrit, particularly in the context of its poetic verses, which are characterized by intricate prosodic and rhythmic patterns. This gap in research raises the question: How can we develop an effective ASR system for Sanskrit, particularly one that captures the nuanced features of its poetic form? In this study, we introduce Vedavani, the first comprehensive ASR study focused on Sanskrit Vedic poetry. We present a 54-hour Sanskrit ASR dataset, consisting of 30,779 labelled audio samples from the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda. This dataset captures the precise prosodic and rhythmic features that define the language. We also benchmark the dataset on various state-of-the-art multilingual speech models.$^{1}$ Experimentation revealed that IndicWhisper performed the best among the SOTA models.

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3 models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS) models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

Abstract: Current LLMs are trained to refuse potentially harmful input queries regardless of whether users actually had harmful intents, causing a tradeoff between safety and user experience. Through a study of 480 participants evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs, we examine how different refusal strategies affect user perceptions across varying motivations. Our findings reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user motivation has negligible impact. Partial compliance -- providing general information without actionable details -- emerges as the optimal strategy, reducing negative user perceptions by over 50% to flat-out refusals. Complementing this, we analyze response patterns of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs and evaluate how 6 reward models score different refusal strategies, demonstrating that models rarely deploy partial compliance naturally and reward models currently undervalue it. This work demonstrates that effective guardrails require focusing on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than detecting intent, offering a path toward AI safety mechanisms that ensure both safety and sustained user engagement.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Radiology reports are critical for clinical decision-making but often lack a standardized format, limiting both human interpretability and machine learning (ML) applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in reformatting clinical text, their high computational requirements, lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns hinder practical deployment. To address these challenges, we explore lightweight encoder-decoder models (<300M parameters)-specifically T5 and BERT2BERT-for structuring radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus datasets. We benchmark these models against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B), adapted using prefix prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) finetuning. Our best-performing lightweight model outperforms all LLMs adapted using prompt-based techniques on a human-annotated test set. While some LoRA-finetuned LLMs achieve modest gains over the lightweight model on the Findings section (BLEU 6.4%, ROUGE-L 4.8%, BERTScore 3.6%, F1-RadGraph 1.1%, GREEN 3.6%, and F1-SRR-BERT 4.3%), these improvements come at the cost of substantially greater computational resources. For example, LLaMA-3-70B incurred more than 400 times the inference time, cost, and carbon emissions compared to the lightweight model. These results underscore the potential of lightweight, task-specific models as sustainable and privacy-preserving solutions for structuring clinical text in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) is a common pretraining method for code Language Model Models (LLMs). Existing LLMs treat code as plain text and mask random character spans, but AST-FIM leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to mask complete syntactic structures for more coherent training examples aligned with universal code structures and editing patterns. The Real-FIM-Eval benchmark, derived from 30,000+ GitHub commits in 12 languages, evaluates real-world FIM programming tasks. Experiments on 1B and 8B parameter models show that AST-FIM is beneficial for real-world code editing, outperforming standard random-character FIM by up to 5 percentage points on standard benchmarks.

Summary: <br />
Accurate intent classification is crucial for effective customer service routing, improving connection between customers and agents while reducing time and cost. However, scalability issues arise with expanding product lines, leading to challenges in handling the increasing number of intents and taxonomy variations. The REIC approach, which combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology, addresses these challenges by dynamically incorporating relevant knowledge for precise intent classification without the need for frequent retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that REIC surpasses traditional fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service applications.

Abstract: Accurate intent classification is critical for efficient routing in customer service, ensuring customers are connected with the most suitable agents while reducing handling times and operational costs. However, as companies expand their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings. Our results highlight its effectiveness in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in adaptive and large-scale intent classification systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly diverse, yet many suffer from monolithic designs that tightly couple core functions like query reformulation, retrieval, reasoning, and verification. This limits their interpretability, systematic evaluation, and targeted improvement, especially for complex multi-hop question answering. We introduce ComposeRAG, a novel modular abstraction that decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic, composable modules. Each module, such as Question Decomposition, Query Rewriting, Retrieval Decision, and Answer Verification, acts as a parameterized transformation on structured inputs/outputs, allowing independent implementation, upgrade, and analysis. To enhance robustness against errors in multi-step reasoning, ComposeRAG incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure. Evaluated on four challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, ComposeRAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity. Specifically, it achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over fine-tuning-based methods and up to a 5% gain over reasoning-specialized pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, ComposeRAG significantly enhances grounding: its verification-first design reduces ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings, and by approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive contributions from each component. These findings underscore ComposeRAG's capacity to deliver flexible, transparent, scalable, and high-performing multi-hop reasoning with improved grounding and interpretability.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare decision-making represents one of the most challenging domains for Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the integration of diverse knowledge sources, complex reasoning, and various external analytical tools. Current AI systems often rely on either task-specific models, which offer limited adaptability, or general language models without grounding with specialized external knowledge and tools. We introduce MedOrch, a novel framework that orchestrates multiple specialized tools and reasoning agents to provide comprehensive medical decision support. MedOrch employs a modular, agent-based architecture that facilitates the flexible integration of domain-specific tools without altering the core system. Furthermore, it ensures transparent and traceable reasoning processes, enabling clinicians to meticulously verify each intermediate step underlying the system's recommendations. We evaluate MedOrch across three distinct medical applications: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, chest X-ray interpretation, and medical visual question answering, using authentic clinical datasets. The results demonstrate MedOrch's competitive performance across these diverse medical tasks. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 93.26%, surpassing the state-of-the-art baseline by over four percentage points. For predicting Alzheimer's disease progression, it attains a 50.35% accuracy, marking a significant improvement. In chest X-ray analysis, MedOrch exhibits superior performance with a Macro AUC of 61.2% and a Macro F1-score of 25.5%. Moreover, in complex multimodal visual question answering (Image+Table), MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 54.47%. These findings underscore MedOrch's potential to advance healthcare AI by enabling reasoning-driven tool utilization for multimodal medical data processing and supporting intricate cognitive tasks in clinical decision-making.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various NLP tasks, but their reliability in critical domains like medicine, especially in low-resource languages such as Persian, is not well studied. The PersianMedQA dataset, containing expert-validated multiple-choice medical questions in Persian and English, was introduced to assess LLMs' performance. Over 40 state-of-the-art models were tested, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) scenarios. General models like GPT-4.1 outperformed others, achieving high accuracy in both languages. Persian fine-tuned models struggled with domain reasoning and instruction-following, while the impact of translation on performance was also analyzed. Despite larger model sizes, robust performance required strong domain and language adaptation. PersianMedQA establishes a basis for evaluating multilingual and culturally informed medical reasoning in LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be accessed at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA

<div> implicit bias, language models, racial concepts, bias mitigation, model representation <br />
Summary: <br />
The study delves into the discrepancy between explicit and implicit bias evaluations in value-aligned language models. While these models appear unbiased in explicit assessments, they exhibit stereotypes in implicit associations. The research reveals that alignment can amplify implicit bias in model outputs by overlooking racial concepts in early internal representations when facing ambiguous contexts. This lack of representation fails to activate safety mechanisms, leading to unintended biases. By incentivizing the early model layers to incorporate racial concepts, a new bias mitigation strategy is proposed. Contrary to conventional approaches like machine unlearning, this method focuses on increasing the model's awareness of race, thus effectively mitigating implicit bias. Similar to the concept of race blindness in humans, ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in language models. <div>

Abstract: Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks, raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers. In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans, ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly used in hiring processes, where candidates often provide demographic information like gender, race, disability, or veteran status. This data is collected for diversity and inclusion efforts but presents concerns about bias in candidate selection when fed to LLMs. While previous studies have shown how disability can affect CV screening, this study specifically examines the impact of voluntarily disclosed disability information on LLM-driven candidate selection. In cases where candidates had identical qualifications and backgrounds but differed in disability status, LLMs consistently favored those who stated they did not have a disability over those who did not disclose their disability status or stated they had a disability. This bias was observed even in job roles with minimal employment rate gaps between individuals with and without disabilities, such as Cashiers or Software Developers.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into hiring processes, concerns about fairness have gained prominence. When applying for jobs, companies often request/require demographic information, including gender, race, and disability or veteran status. This data is collected to support diversity and inclusion initiatives, but when provided to LLMs, especially disability-related information, it raises concerns about potential biases in candidate selection outcomes. Many studies have highlighted how disability can impact CV screening, yet little research has explored the specific effect of voluntarily disclosed information on LLM-driven candidate selection. This study seeks to bridge that gap. When candidates shared identical gender, race, qualifications, experience, and backgrounds, and sought jobs with minimal employment rate gaps between individuals with and without disabilities (e.g., Cashier, Software Developer), LLMs consistently favored candidates who disclosed that they had no disability. Even in cases where candidates chose not to disclose their disability status, the LLMs were less likely to select them compared to those who explicitly stated they did not have a disability.

Summary:
Large Language Models are being increasingly used in critical domains, emphasizing the need for them to detect false assumptions and engage in critical reasoning. Existing benchmarks focus on single-hop false-premise questions, but real-world scenarios often require multi-hop inference for verifying consistency across multiple reasoning steps. To address this gap, the MultiHoax benchmark is introduced. This dataset encompasses seven countries and ten diverse knowledge categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to facilitate factual reasoning across regions. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art Large Language Models struggle in detecting false premises across various countries, knowledge categories, and multi-hop reasoning scenarios. This highlights the necessity for enhanced false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models.

Abstract: As Large Language Models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, their ability to detect false assumptions and reason critically is crucial for ensuring reliable outputs. False-premise questions (FPQs) serve as an important evaluation method by exposing cases where flawed assumptions lead to incorrect responses. While existing benchmarks focus on single-hop FPQs, real-world reasoning often requires multi-hop inference, where models must verify consistency across multiple reasoning steps rather than relying on surface-level cues. To address this gap, we introduce MultiHoax, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle false premises in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable factual reasoning across regions. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to detect false premises across different countries, knowledge categories, and multi-hop reasoning types, highlighting the need for improved false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: The success of large language models has driven interest in developing similar speech processing capabilities. However, a key challenge is the scarcity of high-quality spontaneous speech data, as most existing datasets contain scripted dialogues. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for eliciting and recording natural dialogues and release our Stage 1 dataset with 200+ hours of spontaneous speech. Our approach fosters fluid, natural conversations while encouraging a diverse range of topics and interactive exchanges. Unlike traditional methods, it facilitates genuine interactions, providing a reproducible framework for future data collection. This paper introduces our dataset and methodology, laying the groundwork for addressing the shortage of spontaneous speech data. We plan to expand this dataset in future stages, offering a growing resource for the research community.

arXiv:2506.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual large language model embeddings are increasingly utilized for topic modeling and clustering. However, current methods often scale poorly, rely on opaque similarity metrics, and struggle in multilingual settings. In this work, we present a novel, scalable, interpretable, hierarchical, and multilingual approach to clustering news articles and social media data. To do this, we first train multilingual Matryoshka embeddings that can determine story similarity at varying levels of granularity based on which subset of the dimensions of the embeddings is examined. This embedding model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2022 Task 8 test dataset (Pearson $\rho$ = 0.816). Once trained, we develop an efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm that leverages the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings to identify unique news stories, narratives, and themes. We conclude by illustrating how our approach can identify and cluster stories, narratives, and overarching themes within real-world news datasets.

Summary: 
This study investigates the role of including English data in Continued Pretraining (CPT) for language adaptation. While including English does not affect validation perplexity, it is crucial for developing downstream capabilities in the target language. A language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL) highlights the importance of including English in CPT to prevent early catastrophic forgetting during training. The absence of English data leads to a significant shift in model parameters and hinders the model's ability to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language. The study introduces curriculum learning and exponential moving average of weights as effective strategies to reduce the reliance on English data in CPT. These insights shed light on the dynamics of emergent abilities in language adaptation and provide a foundation for designing more effective adaptation methods in the future. <div>

Abstract: Continued pretraining (CPT) is a popular approach to adapt existing large language models (LLMs) to new languages. When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future.

Abstract: This paper introduces DLM-One, a score-distillation-based framework for one-step sequence generation with continuous diffusion language models (DLMs). DLM-One eliminates the need for iterative refinement by aligning the scores of a student model's outputs in the continuous token embedding space with the score function of a pretrained teacher DLM. We investigate whether DLM-One can achieve substantial gains in sampling efficiency for language modeling. Through comprehensive experiments on DiffuSeq -- a representative continuous DLM -- we show that DLM-One achieves up to ~500x speedup in inference time while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark text generation tasks used to evaluate the teacher models. We further analyze the method's empirical behavior across multiple datasets, providing initial insights into its generality and practical applicability. Our findings position one-step diffusion as a promising direction for efficient, high-quality language generation and broader adoption of continuous diffusion models operating in embedding space for natural language processing.

Summary: <br />
This article introduces a new method for utilizing unvoiced electromyography (EMG) as a communication tool for individuals who cannot produce vocal speech. Unlike previous approaches that required both voiced and unvoiced EMG signals along with speech data, this method focuses solely on unvoiced EMG signals. By developing an EMG adaptor module that maps EMG features into a large language model's input space, the average word error rate for converting unvoiced EMG to text was significantly reduced. Even with minimal data availability, the model outperformed specialized models by 20%. While large language models have been effective in speech recognition tasks, adapting them to understand articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG poses challenges. This study marks a significant advancement in enabling large language models to comprehend unvoiced speech patterns using surface EMG signals. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Unvoiced electromyography (EMG) is an effective communication tool for individuals unable to produce vocal speech. However, most prior methods rely on paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for EMG-to-text conversion, which is not practical for such individuals. Given the rise of large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that maps EMG features into an LLM's input space, achieving an average word error rate (WER) of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown to be extendable to new language modalities -- such as audio -- understanding articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG remains more challenging. This work takes a crucial first step toward enabling LLMs to comprehend unvoiced speech using surface EMG.

<div> compression, Large Language Models, lossless, LZ77, semantics

Summary:
The paper introduces a task-agnostic lossless compression technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) similar to LZ77. The technique reduces the input token sequence length by an average of 27% and 18% for two evaluation tasks. This results in 47% and 33% less encoding computation due to the quadratic nature of attention in transformer-based LLMs. The transformation is easily reversible, preserving semantic information. The approach is evaluated on tasks requiring strict preservation of semantics/syntax, showing that existing lossy compression methods perform poorly in this context. The lossless compression technique only produces a small performance gap compared to using the uncompressed input, suggesting that with larger models and increased computing resources, the gap could be eliminated entirely. <div>

Abstract: Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\% and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would likely erase the gap entirely.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are used for generating movie reviews by utilizing three different models, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0. The study evaluates the generated reviews based on factors like vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic consistency compared to IMDb user reviews. Results show that while LLMs produce syntactically fluent reviews, emotional richness and stylistic coherence still need improvement. Participants in a survey had difficulty distinguishing LLM-generated reviews from IMDb reviews. DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, GPT-4o had an emphasis on positive emotions, and Gemini-2.0 showcased excessive emotional intensity. Overall, LLMs have potential for generating movie reviews, but further refinement is necessary to enhance the quality and emotional depth of the generated content.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been prominent in various tasks, including text generation and summarisation. The applicability of LLMs to the generation of product reviews is gaining momentum, paving the way for the generation of movie reviews. In this study, we propose a framework that generates movie reviews using three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0), and evaluate their performance by comparing the generated outputs with IMDb user reviews. We use movie subtitles and screenplays as input to the LLMs and investigate how they affect the quality of reviews generated. We review the LLM-based movie reviews in terms of vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic consistency in comparison to IMDB user reviews. The results demonstrate that LLMs are capable of generating syntactically fluent and structurally complete movie reviews. Nevertheless, there is still a noticeable gap in emotional richness and stylistic coherence between LLM-generated and IMDb reviews, suggesting that further refinement is needed to improve the overall quality of movie review generation. We provided a survey-based analysis where participants were told to distinguish between LLM and IMDb user reviews. The results show that LLM-generated reviews are difficult to distinguish from IMDB user reviews. We found that DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, closely matching IMDb reviews. GPT-4o overemphasised positive emotions, while Gemini-2.0 captured negative emotions better but showed excessive emotional intensity.

Abstract: As language models evolve to tackle complex, multifaceted tasks, their evaluation must adapt to capture this intricacy. A granular, skill-specific understanding of model capabilities can empower researchers to make informed model development plans. In this paper, we introduce SkillVerse, an unsupervised tree-structured diagnosis framework for understanding model proficiency in specific abilities. With LLM as a judge, SkillVerse first critiques the model responses, and then organizes them into a hierarchical structure termed dendrogram. Given proficiency at arbitrary levels of granularity, SkillVerse is flexible to produce insights of behaviors of modern large models. We also demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream tasks: 1) improving model in-context learning by 25% using a tree-search algorithm to select more informative few-shot demonstrations, and 2) accurately predicting new model weaknesses with a 55% success rate, 22% higher than without SkillVerse.

Summary: TreeRare is a new framework proposed to enhance question answering tasks that require complex and knowledge-intensive reasoning. It utilizes syntax trees to guide information retrieval and reasoning in a bottom-up fashion, generating subcomponent-based queries at each node to resolve uncertainty. A subcomponent question answering module synthesizes relevant passages into context-aware evidence, which is aggregated across the tree to form a final answer. Experimental results across various datasets show that TreeRare outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in handling ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning questions. <div>
arXiv:2506.00331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real practice, questions are typically complex and knowledge-intensive, requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize the multifaceted nature of the question and reason across multiple information sources. Iterative and adaptive retrieval, where LLMs decide when and what to retrieve based on their reasoning, has been shown to be a promising approach to resolve complex, knowledge-intensive questions. However, the performance of such retrieval frameworks is limited by the accumulation of reasoning errors and misaligned retrieval results. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeRare (Syntax Tree-Guided Retrieval and Reasoning), a framework that utilizes syntax trees to guide information retrieval and reasoning for question answering. Following the principle of compositionality, TreeRare traverses the syntax tree in a bottom-up fashion, and in each node, it generates subcomponent-based queries and retrieves relevant passages to resolve localized uncertainty. A subcomponent question answering module then synthesizes these passages into concise, context-aware evidence. Finally, TreeRare aggregates the evidence across the tree to form a final answer. Experiments across five question answering datasets involving ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning demonstrate that TreeRare achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Code-mixing involves the seamless integration of linguistic elements from multiple languages within a single discourse, reflecting natural multilingual communication patterns. Despite its prominence in informal interactions such as social media, chat messages and instant-messaging exchanges, there has been a lack of publicly available corpora that are author-labeled and suitable for modeling human conversations and relationships. This study introduces the first labeled and general-purpose corpus for understanding code-mixing in context while maintaining rigorous privacy and ethical standards. Our live project will continuously gather, verify, and integrate code-mixed messages into a structured dataset released in JSON format, accompanied by detailed metadata and linguistic statistics. To date, it includes over 355,641 messages spanning various code-mixing patterns, with a primary focus on English, Mandarin, and other languages. We expect the Codemix Corpus to serve as a foundational dataset for research in computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and NLP applications.

<div> Keywords: emotion recognition, language models, Theory-of-Mind, cognitive appraisal theory, dataset<br />
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) are often used for emotion recognition but struggle with understanding emotional states beyond surface-level cues. This study explores how LLMs reason about emotions using contextual information within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. By creating a specialized ToM evaluation dataset grounded in Cognitive Appraisal Theory, the researchers assessed the models' ability for both forward and backward reasoning. The study found that LLMs can reason to some extent but struggle to associate situational outcomes and appraisals with specific emotions. This highlights the importance of incorporating psychological theories in the training and evaluation of LLMs for emotion reasoning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Datasets used for emotion recognition tasks typically contain overt cues that can be used in predicting the emotions expressed in a text. However, one challenge is that texts sometimes contain covert contextual cues that are rich in affective semantics, which warrant higher-order reasoning abilities to infer emotional states, not simply the emotions conveyed. This study advances beyond surface-level perceptual features to investigate how large language models (LLMs) reason about others' emotional states using contextual information, within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. Grounded in Cognitive Appraisal Theory, we curate a specialized ToM evaluation dataset1 to assess both forward reasoning - from context to emotion- and backward reasoning - from emotion to inferred context. We showed that LLMs can reason to a certain extent, although they are poor at associating situational outcomes and appraisals with specific emotions. Our work highlights the need for psychological theories in the training and evaluation of LLMs in the context of emotion reasoning.

Abstract: The Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM) project has developed a series of fully open speech foundation models using academic-scale resources, but their training data remains insufficient. This work enhances OWSM by integrating YODAS, a large-scale web-crawled dataset with a Creative Commons license. However, incorporating YODAS is nontrivial due to its wild nature, which introduces challenges such as incorrect language labels and audio-text misalignments. To address this, we develop a scalable data-cleaning pipeline using public toolkits, yielding a dataset with 166,000 hours of speech across 75 languages. Our new series of OWSM v4 models, trained on this curated dataset alongside existing OWSM data, significantly outperform previous versions on multilingual benchmarks. Our models even match or surpass frontier industrial models like Whisper and MMS in multiple scenarios. We will publicly release the cleaned YODAS data, pre-trained models, and all associated scripts via the ESPnet toolkit.

Summary:
Test-time computation is crucial for improving the reliability and quality of large language models (LLMs). Semantic clustering, which groups outputs with the same meaning, plays a key role in enhancing LLM performance. However, existing methods often rely on external models, leading to high computational costs and limited context-awareness. To address this, Latent Semantic Clustering (LSC) is proposed as a lightweight and context-sensitive solution that uses internal hidden states of the generator LLM for clustering. LSC eliminates the need for external models, significantly improving computational efficiency while maintaining or exceeding the performance of current methods. This approach has been extensively tested across various LLMs and datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing test-time scaling strategies.

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation--generating and analyzing multiple or sequential outputs for a single input--has become a promising strategy for improving the reliability and quality of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by advances in uncertainty quantification and multi-step reasoning. A key shared component is semantic clustering, which groups outputs that differ in form but convey the same meaning. Semantic clustering enables estimation of the distribution over the semantics of outputs and helps avoid redundant exploration of reasoning paths. However, existing approaches typically rely on external models, which introduce substantial computational overhead and often fail to capture context-aware semantics. We propose Latent Semantic Clustering (LSC), a lightweight and context-sensitive method that leverages the generator LLM's internal hidden states for clustering, eliminating the need for external models. Our extensive experiment across various LLMs and datasets shows that LSC significantly improves the computational efficiency of test-time scaling while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing methods.

Abstract: Decoding continuous language from neural signals remains a significant challenge in the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We introduce Neuro2Semantic, a novel framework that reconstructs the semantic content of perceived speech from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Our approach consists of two phases: first, an LSTM-based adapter aligns neural signals with pre-trained text embeddings; second, a corrector module generates continuous, natural text directly from these aligned embeddings. This flexible method overcomes the limitations of previous decoding approaches and enables unconstrained text generation. Neuro2Semantic achieves strong performance with as little as 30 minutes of neural data, outperforming a recent state-of-the-art method in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential for practical applications in brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding technologies.

Effective communication training is crucial for nurses to provide high-quality patient care. While standardized patient simulations are valuable, they can be costly and inflexible. Virtual patient systems offer a scalable alternative, but most lack the ability to adapt to trainees' varying communication skills. Adaptive-VP, a framework introduced in this study, utilizes large language models to dynamically adjust virtual patient behavior based on trainee input. The framework includes a pipeline for creating flexible yet clinically sound scenarios and a system for evaluating trainee communication in real time and modifying virtual patient responses accordingly. Evaluation results showed that Adaptive-VP produced natural and realistic interactions, reflecting real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses confirmed its effectiveness, positioning it as a scalable and valuable tool for nursing communication training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Effective communication training is essential to preparing nurses for high-quality patient care. While standardized patient (SP) simulations provide valuable experiential learning, they are often costly and inflexible. Virtual patient (VP) systems offer a scalable alternative, but most fail to adapt to the varying communication skills of trainees. In particular, when trainees respond ineffectively, VPs should escalate in hostility or become uncooperative--yet this level of adaptive interaction remains largely unsupported. To address this gap, we introduce Adaptive-VP, a VP dialogue generation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically adapt VP behavior based on trainee input. The framework features a pipeline for constructing clinically grounded yet flexible VP scenarios and a modular system for assessing trainee communication and adjusting VP responses in real time, while ensuring learner safety. We validated Adaptive-VP by simulating challenging patient conversations. Automated evaluation using a corpus from practicing nurses showed that our communication skill evaluation mechanism reflected real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses further confirmed that Adaptive-VP produced more natural and realistic interactions than existing approaches, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and effective tool for nursing communication training.

Summary: 
SHARE is a new approach for self-correction in text-to-SQL tasks that addresses two critical limitations in existing methods. It utilizes Small Language Models (SLMs) in a sequential pipeline to transform declarative SQL queries into stepwise action trajectories, enabling more precise error localization and efficient correction. SHARE also introduces a hierarchical self-evolution strategy for data-efficient training. Experimental results show that SHARE significantly enhances self-correction capabilities across various Large Language Models (LLMs). It remains robust in low-resource training settings, making it valuable for text-to-SQL applications with data privacy concerns. <div>
arXiv:2506.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current self-correction approaches in text-to-SQL face two critical limitations: 1) Conventional self-correction methods rely on recursive self-calls of LLMs, resulting in multiplicative computational overhead, and 2) LLMs struggle to implement effective error detection and correction for declarative SQL queries, as they fail to demonstrate the underlying reasoning path. In this work, we propose SHARE, an SLM-based Hierarchical Action corREction assistant that enables LLMs to perform more precise error localization and efficient correction. SHARE orchestrates three specialized Small Language Models (SLMs) in a sequential pipeline, where it first transforms declarative SQL queries into stepwise action trajectories that reveal underlying reasoning, followed by a two-phase granular refinement. We further propose a novel hierarchical self-evolution strategy for data-efficient training. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARE effectively enhances self-correction capabilities while proving robust across various LLMs. Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis shows that SHARE maintains strong performance even in low-resource training settings, which is particularly valuable for text-to-SQL applications with data privacy constraints.

Summary: 
The article introduces the 3E Criteria for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of search strategies in Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights the trade-off between performance and computational cost in current methods and proposes the Speculative Reward Model (SRM) to enhance decision-making efficiency. SRM integrates an external reward assigner and a speculative verification mechanism to guide search strategies towards optimal actions.

arXiv:2506.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for handling intricate tasks. However, existing approaches prioritize performance but often overlook the balance between effectiveness and computational cost. To address this, we first introduce the 3E Criteria to systematically assess the cost-effectiveness of search strategies, revealing that existing methods often trade significant efficiency for marginal performance gains. To improve LLM decision-making while maintaining efficiency, we propose the Speculative Reward Model (SRM), a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates with existing search strategies. Specifically, SRM employs an external reward assigner to predict optimal actions, reducing reliance on LLMs' internal self-evaluation. And a speculative verification mechanism is used to prune suboptimal choices and guide the search toward more promising steps. We evaluate SRM on several complex decision-making tasks including mathematical reasoning, planning and numerical reasoning in specialized domains. Experimental results show that SRM reduces costs to 1/10 of the original search framework on average while maintaining effectiveness.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the optimization of textual prompts in large language models (LLMs) through the Textual Gradient Descent (TGD) framework. It highlights that scaling the number of training examples initially improves TGD's performance but later degrades it for various NLP tasks. Data scaling improves results but also increases computational costs. To address this, the Textual Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M) method is proposed, which reweights prompt sampling based on past batch distributions to facilitate scalable in-context learning. Empirical results across nine NLP tasks show that TSGD-M significantly outperforms TGD baselines and reduces variance, particularly in tasks such as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), natural language understanding tasks, and reasoning tasks. This approach enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of optimizing textual prompts in LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As prompts play an increasingly critical role in large language models (LLMs), optimizing textual prompts has become a crucial challenge. The Textual Gradient Descent (TGD) framework has emerged as a promising data-driven approach that iteratively refines textual prompts using LLM - suggested updates (or textual gradients) over minibatches of training samples. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that scaling the number of training examples initially improves but later degrades TGD's performance across multiple downstream NLP tasks. However, while data scaling improves results for most tasks, it also significantly increases the computational cost when leveraging LLMs. To address this, we draw inspiration from numerical gradient descent and propose Textual Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M) - a method that facilitates scalable in-context learning by reweighting prompt sampling based on past batch distributions. Across nine NLP tasks spanning three domains - including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), natural language understanding tasks, and reasoning tasks - TSGD-M significantly outperforms TGD baselines that do not incorporate reweighted sampling, while also reducing variance in most tasks.

<div> Keywords: children, automatic speech recognition, causal structure discovery, fine-tuned models, interdependent relationships

Summary: 
Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance is influenced by various factors, including physiological differences, cognitive development, and external factors like vocabulary and background noise. Existing analysis often overlooks the interconnected nature of these factors, such as how age impacts both ASR accuracy and pronunciation skills. In this study, a causal structure discovery method is used to untangle the relationships between physiology, cognition, extrinsic factors, and ASR errors in children. Causal quantification is then employed to measure the impact of each factor on children's ASR performance. The analysis is extended to fine-tuned models to determine which factors are alleviated by fine-tuning and which persist. Experiments on Whisper and Wav2Vec2.0 ASR systems validate the findings' generalizability across different models. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into understanding and improving children's ASR accuracy by considering the complex interplay of physiological, cognitive, and extrinsic factors. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) often underperforms compared to that of adults due to a confluence of interdependent factors: physiological (e.g., smaller vocal tracts), cognitive (e.g., underdeveloped pronunciation), and extrinsic (e.g., vocabulary limitations, background noise). Existing analysis methods examine the impact of these factors in isolation, neglecting interdependencies-such as age affecting ASR accuracy both directly and indirectly via pronunciation skills. In this paper, we introduce a causal structure discovery to unravel these interdependent relationships among physiology, cognition, extrinsic factors, and ASR errors. Then, we employ causal quantification to measure each factor's impact on children's ASR. We extend the analysis to fine-tuned models to identify which factors are mitigated by fine-tuning and which remain largely unaffected. Experiments on Whisper and Wav2Vec2.0 demonstrate the generalizability of our findings across different ASR systems.

<div> adaptive parallel decoding, diffusion large language models, throughput, quality, autoregressive decoding

Summary: 
Adaptive Parallel Decoding (APD) is introduced as a method to enhance the generation speed of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) by dynamically adjusting the number of tokens sampled in parallel. This approach deviates from traditional autoregressive decoding by combining dLLM marginal probabilities with an auxiliary autoregressive model for more efficient token generation. By optimizing APD with techniques like KV caching and limiting input size, it offers three tunable parameters to balance throughput and quality tradeoffs. APD demonstrates significantly higher throughput while maintaining minimal quality degradation on various downstream benchmarks. This innovative method provides a promising solution to the bottleneck of autoregressive decoding in LLMs and showcases the potential for achieving faster generation speeds without compromising model quality. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation speed of LLMs are bottlenecked by autoregressive decoding, where tokens are predicted sequentially one by one. Alternatively, diffusion large language models (dLLMs) theoretically allow for parallel token generation, but in practice struggle to achieve the speed of autoregressive models without significantly sacrificing quality. We therefore introduce adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly tradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher throughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: In context learning, text generation, noisy annotations, perplexity, debiasing framework

Summary:
In the study, a new approach is proposed for detecting noise in annotations in the context of text generation for in context learning (ICL). The existing method based on perplexity is reexamined to address biases arising from annotations and large language models (LLMs). A dual debiasing framework is introduced to correct perplexity estimates using synthesized neighbors, leading to a robust Sample Cleanliness Score that accurately identifies sample cleanliness regardless of overall corpus noise levels. Extensive experiments showcase the superior noise detection capabilities of the proposed method, with ICL performance comparable to fully clean demonstration corpora even in the presence of high noise ratios. The approach demonstrates resilience to extremely high noise levels, making it a promising solution for improving the quality of demonstrations in ICL settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In context learning (ICL) relies heavily on high quality demonstrations drawn from large annotated corpora. Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed. We reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior noise detection capabilities and show that its final ICL performance is comparable to that of a fully clean demonstration corpus. Moreover, our approach remains robust even when noise ratios are extremely high.

Summary: <br />
The study focuses on enhancing chatbots by incorporating both visual and auditory aspects into conversations. Existing research has mainly focused on visual tasks, neglecting auditory elements. The new Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$) dataset is introduced for this purpose. A novel multimodal conversation model with multimodal memory retrieval is proposed and trained on the $M^3C$. The model is capable of engaging in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs. Human evaluations show the model's strong performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, indicating its potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As chatbots continue to evolve toward human-like, real-world, interactions, multimodality remains an active area of research and exploration. So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears", namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots with "eyes and ears" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset, Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model, trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents.

<title>DYNAC: Dynamic Vocabulary based Non-Autoregressive Contextualization for Speech Recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00422</link>

Abstract: Contextual biasing (CB) improves automatic speech recognition for rare and unseen phrases. Recent studies have introduced dynamic vocabulary, which represents context phrases as expandable tokens in autoregressive (AR) models. This method improves CB accuracy but with slow inference speed. While dynamic vocabulary can be applied to non-autoregressive (NAR) models, such as connectionist temporal classification (CTC), the conditional independence assumption fails to capture dependencies between static and dynamic tokens. This paper proposes DYNAC (Dynamic Vocabulary-based NAR Contextualization), a self-conditioned CTC method that integrates dynamic vocabulary into intermediate layers. Conditioning the encoder on dynamic vocabulary, DYNAC effectively captures dependencies between static and dynamic tokens while reducing the real-time factor (RTF). Experimental results show that DYNAC reduces RTF by 81% with a 0.1-point degradation in word error rate on the LibriSpeech 960 test-clean set.

Abstract: Multi-answer question answering (QA), where questions can have many valid answers, presents a significant challenge for existing retrieval-augmented generation-based QA systems, as these systems struggle to retrieve and then synthesize a large number of evidence passages. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new multi-answer QA framework -- Retrieval-augmented Independent Reading with Inter-passage Verification (RI$^2$VER). Our framework retrieves a large set of passages and processes each passage individually to generate an initial high-recall but noisy answer set. Then we propose a new inter-passage verification pipeline that validates every candidate answer through (1) Verification Question Generation, (2) Gathering Additional Evidence, and (3) Verification with inter-passage synthesis. Evaluations on the QAMPARI and RoMQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines across various model sizes, achieving an average F1 score improvement of 11.17%. Further analysis validates that our inter-passage verification pipeline enables our framework to be particularly beneficial for questions requiring multi-evidence synthesis.

<title>G2S: A General-to-Specific Learning Framework for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting with Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00445</link>

Abstract: Forecasting over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) which predicts future facts based on historical ones has received much attention. Recent studies have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task to enhance the models' generalization abilities. However, these models perform forecasting via simultaneously learning two kinds of entangled knowledge in the TKG: (1) general patterns, i.e., invariant temporal structures shared across different scenarios; and (2) scenario information, i.e., factual knowledge engaged in specific scenario, such as entities and relations. As a result, the learning processes of these two kinds of knowledge may interfere with each other, which potentially impact the generalization abilities of the models. To enhance the generalization ability of LLMs on this task, in this paper, we propose a General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) that disentangles the learning processes of the above two kinds of knowledge. In the general learning stage, we mask the scenario information in different TKGs and convert it into anonymous temporal structures. After training on these structures, the model is able to capture the general patterns across different TKGs. In the specific learning stage, we inject the scenario information into the structures via either in-context learning or fine-tuning modes. Experimental results show that G2S effectively improves the generalization abilities of LLMs.

<title>Fact-Controlled Diagnosis of Hallucinations in Medical Text Summarization</title>

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during summarization of patient-clinician dialogues pose significant risks to patient care and clinical decision-making. However, the phenomenon remains understudied in the clinical domain, with uncertainty surrounding the applicability of general-domain hallucination detectors. The rarity and randomness of hallucinations further complicate their investigation. In this paper, we conduct an evaluation of hallucination detection methods in the medical domain, and construct two datasets for the purpose: A fact-controlled Leave-N-out dataset -- generated by systematically removing facts from source dialogues to induce hallucinated content in summaries; and a natural hallucination dataset -- arising organically during LLM-based medical summarization. We show that general-domain detectors struggle to detect clinical hallucinations, and that performance on fact-controlled hallucinations does not reliably predict effectiveness on natural hallucinations. We then develop fact-based approaches that count hallucinations, offering explainability not available with existing methods. Notably, our LLM-based detectors, which we developed using fact-controlled hallucinations, generalize well to detecting real-world clinical hallucinations. This research contributes a suite of specialized metrics supported by expert-annotated datasets to advance faithful clinical summarization systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates a critical design decision in the practice of massively multilingual continual pre-training -- the inclusion of parallel data. Specifically, we study the impact of bilingual translation data for massively multilingual language adaptation of the Llama3 family of models to 500 languages. To this end, we construct the MaLA bilingual translation corpus, containing data from more than 2,500 language pairs. Subsequently, we develop the EMMA-500 Llama 3 suite of four massively multilingual models -- continually pre-trained from the Llama 3 family of base models extensively on diverse data mixes up to 671B tokens -- and explore the effect of continual pre-training with or without bilingual translation data. Comprehensive evaluation across 7 tasks and 12 benchmarks demonstrates that bilingual data tends to enhance language transfer and performance, particularly for low-resource languages. We open-source the MaLA corpus, EMMA-500 Llama 3 suite artefacts, code, and model generations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet their significant computational demands hinder practical deployment. While efforts to improve LVLM efficiency are growing, existing methods lack comprehensive evaluation across diverse backbones, benchmarks, and metrics.

We introduce EffiVLM-Bench, a unified framework for assessing not only absolute performance but also generalization and loyalty, while exploring Pareto-optimal trade-offs. Our extensive experiments and in-depth analyses offer insights into optimal strategies for accelerating LVLMs. We open-source code and recipes for EffiVLM-Bench to foster future research.

<title>PVP: An Image Dataset for Personalized Visual Persuasion with Persuasion Strategies, Viewer Characteristics, and Persuasiveness Ratings</title>

Abstract: Visual persuasion, which uses visual elements to influence cognition and behaviors, is crucial in fields such as advertising and political communication. With recent advancements in artificial intelligence, there is growing potential to develop persuasive systems that automatically generate persuasive images tailored to individuals. However, a significant bottleneck in this area is the lack of comprehensive datasets that connect the persuasiveness of images with the personal information about those who evaluated the images. To address this gap and facilitate technological advancements in personalized visual persuasion, we release the Personalized Visual Persuasion (PVP) dataset, comprising 28,454 persuasive images across 596 messages and 9 persuasion strategies. Importantly, the PVP dataset provides persuasiveness scores of images evaluated by 2,521 human annotators, along with their demographic and psychological characteristics (personality traits and values). We demonstrate the utility of our dataset by developing a persuasive image generator and an automated evaluator, and establish benchmark baselines. Our experiments reveal that incorporating psychological characteristics enhances the generation and evaluation of persuasive images, providing valuable insights for personalized visual persuasion.

Abstract: Multi-hop questions still stump large language models (LLMs), which struggle to link information across multiple reasoning steps. We introduce Auto-Patch, a novel method that dynamically patches hidden states during inference to enhance multi-hop reasoning in LLMs. Building on the PatchScopes framework, Auto-Patch selectively modifies internal representations using a learned classifier. Evaluated on the MuSiQue dataset, Auto-Patch improves the solve rate from 18.45\% (baseline) to 23.63~$\pm$~0.7\% (3 runs), narrowing the gap to Chain-of-Thought prompting (27.44\%). Our results highlight the potential of dynamic hidden state interventions for advancing complex reasoning in LLMs.

<title>Synergizing LLMs with Global Label Propagation for Multimodal Fake News Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00488</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist multimodal fake news detection by predicting pseudo labels. However, LLM-generated pseudo labels alone demonstrate poor performance compared to traditional detection methods, making their effective integration non-trivial. In this paper, we propose Global Label Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) for multimodal fake news detection, which integrates LLM capabilities via label propagation techniques. The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not propagate their own labels back to themselves. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that by synergizing LLMs with label propagation, our model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various tasks, leveraging their exceptional in-context learning ability with only a few examples. Accordingly, the selection of optimal in-context examples has been actively studied in the field of machine translation. However, these studies presuppose the presence of a demonstration pool with human-annotated pairs, making them less applicable to low-resource languages where such an assumption is challenging to meet. To overcome this limitation, this paper explores the research direction of in-context example generation for machine translation. Specifically, we propose Demonstration Augmentation for Translation (DAT), a simple yet effective approach that generates example pairs without relying on any external resources. This method builds upon two prior criteria, relevance and diversity, which have been highlighted in previous work as key factors for in-context example selection. Through experiments and analysis on low-resource languages where human-annotated pairs are scarce, we show that DAT achieves superior translation quality compared to the baselines. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of progressively accumulating generated pairs during test time to build and reuse a demonstration pool. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/aiclaudev/DAT.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have demonstrated strong advantages in addressing complex real-world tasks. However, due to the introduction of additional attack surfaces, MASs are particularly vulnerable to misinformation injection. To facilitate a deeper understanding of misinformation propagation dynamics within these systems, we introduce MisinfoTask, a novel dataset featuring complex, realistic tasks designed to evaluate MAS robustness against such threats. Building upon this, we propose ARGUS, a two-stage, training-free defense framework leveraging goal-aware reasoning for precise misinformation rectification within information flows. Our experiments demonstrate that in challenging misinformation scenarios, ARGUS exhibits significant efficacy across various injection attacks, achieving an average reduction in misinformation toxicity of approximately 28.17% and improving task success rates under attack by approximately 10.33%.

<title>Evaluating the Evaluation of Diversity in Commonsense Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In commonsense generation, given a set of input concepts, a model must generate a response that is not only commonsense bearing, but also capturing multiple diverse viewpoints. Numerous evaluation metrics based on form- and content-level overlap have been proposed in prior work for evaluating the diversity of a commonsense generation model. However, it remains unclear as to which metrics are best suited for evaluating the diversity in commonsense generation. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of diversity metrics for commonsense generation. We find that form-based diversity metrics tend to consistently overestimate the diversity in sentence sets, where even randomly generated sentences are assigned overly high diversity scores. We then use an Large Language Model (LLM) to create a novel dataset annotated for the diversity of sentences generated for a commonsense generation task, and use it to conduct a meta-evaluation of the existing diversity evaluation metrics. Our experimental results show that content-based diversity evaluation metrics consistently outperform the form-based counterparts, showing high correlations with the LLM-based ratings. We recommend that future work on commonsense generation should use content-based metrics for evaluating the diversity of their outputs.

arXiv:2506.00519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit knowledge disparities across languages. Encouraging LLMs to \textit{abstain} when faced with knowledge gaps is a promising strategy to reduce hallucinations in multilingual settings. Current abstention strategies for multilingual scenarios primarily rely on generating feedback in various languages using LLMs and performing self-reflection. However, these methods can be adversely impacted by inaccuracies and biases in the generated feedback. To address this, from a causal perspective, we introduce \textit{CausalAbstain}, a method that helps LLMs determine whether to utilize multiple generated feedback responses and how to identify the most useful ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{CausalAbstain} effectively selects helpful feedback and enhances abstention decisions with interpretability in both native language (\textsc{Casual-native}) and multilingual (\textsc{Causal-multi}) settings, outperforming strong baselines on two benchmark datasets covering encyclopedic and commonsense knowledge QA tasks. Our code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/peachch/CausalAbstain.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the Intellectual Property (IP) field often struggle with diverse user queries, including colloquial expressions, spelling errors, and ambiguous terminology, leading to inaccurate retrieval and suboptimal responses. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Angle Question Generation and Retrieval Fine-Tuning Method (MQG-RFM), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate varied user inquiries and fine-tunes retrieval models to align semantically equivalent but linguistically diverse questions. Unlike complex architectural modifications, MQG-RFM adopts a lightweight Data-to-Tune paradigm, combining prompt-engineered query generation with hard negative mining to enhance retrieval robustness without costly infrastructure changes. Experimental results on a Taiwan patent Q&amp;A dataset show 185.62% improvement in retrieval accuracy on the Patent Consultation dataset and 262.26% improvement on the Novel Patent Technology Report dataset, with 14.22% and 53.58% improvements in generation quality over the baselines, respectively. By bridging the gap between user intent and system comprehension through semantic-aware retrieval optimization, MQG-RFM offers a practical, scalable approach for rapid, cost-effective deployment among small and medium-sized agencies seeking reliable patent intelligence solutions. Additionally, our proposed method has already been adopted by ScholarMate, the largest professional research social networking platform in China, to support real-world development and deployment. A demo version of the instantiated is available at https://github.com/renruntao/patent_rag.

<title>Decoupling Reasoning and Knowledge Injection for In-Context Knowledge Editing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently update Large Language Models (LLMs) by modifying specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. Among knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) offers a lightweight solution by injecting new knowledge directly into the input context, leaving model parameters unchanged. However, existing ICE approaches do not explicitly separate the newly injected knowledge from the model's original reasoning process. This entanglement often results in conflicts between external updates and internal parametric knowledge, undermining the consistency and accuracy of the reasoning path.In this work, we conduct preliminary experiments to examine how parametric knowledge influences reasoning path planning. We find that the model's reasoning is tightly coupled with its internal knowledge, and that naively injecting new information without adapting the reasoning path often leads to performance degradation, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To this end, we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that decouples reasoning from knowledge editing by generating a masked reasoning path and then resolving knowledge edits via hybrid retrieval and model-based validation. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show that DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE methods by mitigating knowledge conflicts and preserving reasoning consistency. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bebr2/DecKER .

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to perform complex reasoning and decision-making through free-form language interactions. However, in open-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking games), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens, resulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a space can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance, hindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose ARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient and effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks, consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.

Abstract: Evaluation frameworks for text summarization have evolved in terms of both domain coverage and metrics. However, existing benchmarks still lack domain-specific assessment criteria, remain predominantly English-centric, and face challenges with human annotation due to the complexity of reasoning. To address these, we introduce MSumBench, which provides a multi-dimensional, multi-domain evaluation of summarization in English and Chinese. It also incorporates specialized assessment criteria for each domain and leverages a multi-agent debate system to enhance annotation quality. By evaluating eight modern summarization models, we discover distinct performance patterns across domains and languages. We further examine large language models as summary evaluators, analyzing the correlation between their evaluation and summarization capabilities, and uncovering systematic bias in their assessment of self-generated summaries. Our benchmark dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/MSumBench.

Abstract: Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents (CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios, to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges: dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues, enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual, demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in psychological counseling compared to existing baselines. The ethically reviewed and screened code can be found on https://github.com/sci-m-wang/AnnaAgent.

<title>The Hidden Language of Harm: Examining the Role of Emojis in Harmful Online Communication and Content Moderation</title>

Abstract: Social media platforms have become central to modern communication, yet they also harbor offensive content that challenges platform safety and inclusivity. While prior research has primarily focused on textual indicators of offense, the role of emojis, ubiquitous visual elements in online discourse, remains underexplored. Emojis, despite being rarely offensive in isolation, can acquire harmful meanings through symbolic associations, sarcasm, and contextual misuse. In this work, we systematically examine emoji contributions to offensive Twitter messages, analyzing their distribution across offense categories and how users exploit emoji ambiguity. To address this, we propose an LLM-powered, multi-step moderation pipeline that selectively replaces harmful emojis while preserving the tweet's semantic intent. Human evaluations confirm our approach effectively reduces perceived offensiveness without sacrificing meaning.

<title>Entriever: Energy-based Retriever for Knowledge-Grounded Dialog Systems</title>

Abstract: A retriever, which retrieves relevant knowledge pieces from a knowledge base given a context, is an important component in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Retrievers have been introduced in knowledge-grounded dialog systems to improve knowledge acquisition. In knowledge-grounded dialog systems, when conditioning on a given context, there may be multiple relevant and correlated knowledge pieces. However, knowledge pieces are usually assumed to be conditionally independent in current retriever models. To address this issue, we propose Entriever, an energy-based retriever. Entriever directly models the candidate retrieval results as a whole instead of modeling the knowledge pieces separately, with the relevance score defined by an energy function. We explore various architectures of energy functions and different training methods for Entriever, and show that Entriever substantially outperforms the strong cross-encoder baseline in knowledge retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we show that in semi-supervised training of knowledge-grounded dialog systems, Entriever enables effective scoring of retrieved knowledge pieces and significantly improves end-to-end performance of dialog systems.

Abstract: Contract review is a complex and time-intensive task that typically demands specialized legal expertise, rendering it largely inaccessible to non-experts. Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives. To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source, end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component, enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable, and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.

<title>Enhancing Clinical Multiple-Choice Questions Benchmarks with Knowledge Graph Guided Distractor Generation</title>

Abstract: Clinical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment require strong decision-making abilities, highlighting the importance of rigorous evaluation benchmarks to assess the reliability of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a knowledge-guided data augmentation framework that enhances the difficulty of clinical multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets by generating distractors (i.e., incorrect choices that are similar to the correct one and may confuse existing LLMs). Using our KG-based pipeline, the generated choices are both clinically plausible and deliberately misleading. Our approach involves multi-step, semantically informed walks on a medical knowledge graph to identify distractor paths-associations that are medically relevant but factually incorrect-which then guide the LLM in crafting more deceptive distractors. We apply the designed knowledge graph guided distractor generation (KGGDG) pipline, to six widely used medical QA benchmarks and show that it consistently reduces the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs. These findings establish KGGDG as a powerful tool for enabling more robust and diagnostic evaluations of medical LLMs.

<title>Improving Dialogue State Tracking through Combinatorial Search for In-Context Examples</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00622</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dialogue state tracking (DST), in-context learning comprises a retriever that selects labeled dialogues as in-context examples and a DST model that uses these examples to infer the dialogue state of the query dialogue. Existing methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and (3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch, a method that scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20x gain in data efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch attains a 12% absolute improvement in the upper bound DST performance over traditional approaches when no retrieval errors are assumed. This significantly increases the headroom for practical DST performance while demonstrating that existing methods rely on suboptimal data for retriever training.

<title>LID Models are Actually Accent Classifiers: Implications and Solutions for LID on Accented Speech</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior research indicates that LID model performance significantly declines on accented speech; however, the specific causes, extent, and characterization of these errors remain under-explored. (i) We identify a common failure mode on accented speech whereby LID systems often misclassify L2 accented speech as the speaker's native language or a related language. (ii) We present evidence suggesting that state-of-the-art models are invariant to permutations of short spans of speech, implying they classify on the basis of short phonotactic features indicative of accent rather than language. Our analysis reveals a simple method to enhance model robustness to accents through input chunking. (iii) We present an approach that integrates sequence-level information into our model without relying on monolingual ASR systems; this reduces accent-language confusion and significantly enhances performance on accented speech while maintaining comparable results on standard LID.

<title>Social Construction of Urban Space: Understanding Neighborhood Boundaries Using Rental Listings</title>

Abstract: Rental listings offer a unique window into how urban space is socially constructed through language. We analyze Chicago Craigslist rental advertisements from 2018 to 2024 to examine how listing agents characterize neighborhoods, identifying mismatches between institutional boundaries and neighborhood claims. Through manual and large language model annotation, we classify unstructured listings from Craigslist according to their neighborhood. Geospatial analysis reveals three distinct patterns: properties with conflicting neighborhood designations due to competing spatial definitions, border properties with valid claims to adjacent neighborhoods, and ``reputation laundering" where listings claim association with distant, desirable neighborhoods. Through topic modeling, we identify patterns that correlate with spatial positioning: listings further from neighborhood centers emphasize different amenities than centrally-located units. Our findings demonstrate that natural language processing techniques can reveal how definitions of urban spaces are contested in ways that traditional methods overlook.

Abstract: Toxic speech on online platforms is a growing concern, impacting user experience and online safety. While text-based toxicity detection is well-studied, audio-based approaches remain underexplored, especially for low-resource languages like Vietnamese. This paper introduces ViToSA (Vietnamese Toxic Spans Audio), the first dataset for toxic spans detection in Vietnamese speech, comprising 11,000 audio samples (25 hours) with accurate human-annotated transcripts. We propose a pipeline that combines ASR and toxic spans detection for fine-grained identification of toxic content. Our experiments show that fine-tuning ASR models on ViToSA significantly reduces WER when transcribing toxic speech, while the text-based toxic spans detection (TSD) models outperform existing baselines. These findings establish a novel benchmark for Vietnamese audio-based toxic spans detection, paving the way for future research in speech content moderation.

<title>Improving the Calibration of Confidence Scores in Text Generation Using the Output Distribution's Characteristics</title>

Abstract: Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a confident model could distribute its output probability among multiple sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic confidence metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities associated with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics. Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored. We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges: selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in realistic, multi-answer applications.

Abstract: Stuttering is a complex disorder that requires specialized expertise for effective assessment and treatment. This paper presents an effort to enhance the FluencyBank dataset with a new stuttering annotation scheme based on established clinical standards. To achieve high-quality annotations, we hired expert clinicians to label the data, ensuring that the resulting annotations mirror real-world clinical expertise. The annotations are multi-modal, incorporating audiovisual features for the detection and classification of stuttering moments, secondary behaviors, and tension scores. In addition to individual annotations, we additionally provide a test set with highly reliable annotations based on expert consensus for assessing individual annotators and machine learning models. Our experiments and analysis illustrate the complexity of this task that necessitates extensive clinical expertise for valid training and evaluation of stuttering assessment models.

Abstract: Information Extraction (IE) systems are traditionally domain-specific, requiring costly adaptation that involves expert schema design, data annotation, and model training. While Large Language Models have shown promise in zero-shot IE, performance degrades significantly in unseen domains where label definitions differ. This paper introduces GUIDEX, a novel method that automatically defines domain-specific schemas, infers guidelines, and generates synthetically labeled instances, allowing for better out-of-domain generalization. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 with GUIDEX sets a new state-of-the-art across seven zeroshot Named Entity Recognition benchmarks. Models trained with GUIDEX gain up to 7 F1 points over previous methods without humanlabeled data, and nearly 2 F1 points higher when combined with it. Models trained on GUIDEX demonstrate enhanced comprehension of complex, domain-specific annotation schemas. Code, models, and synthetic datasets are available at neilus03.github.io/guidex.com

Abstract: Sarcasm is a form of humor where expressions convey meanings opposite to their literal interpretations. Classifying and generating sarcasm using large language models is vital for interpreting human communication. Sarcasm poses challenges for computational models, due to its nuanced nature. We introduce Sarc7, a benchmark that classifies 7 types of sarcasm: self-deprecating, brooding, deadpan, polite, obnoxious, raging, and manic by annotating entries of the MUStARD dataset. Classification was evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and a novel emotion-based prompting technique. We propose an emotion-based generation method developed by identifying key components of sarcasm-incongruity, shock value, and context dependency. Our classification experiments show that Gemini 2.5, using emotion-based prompting, outperforms other setups with an F1 score of 0.3664. Human evaluators preferred our emotion-based prompting, with 38.46% more successful generations than zero-shot prompting.

Abstract: Malicious attackers can exploit large language models (LLMs) by engaging them in multi-turn dialogues to achieve harmful objectives, posing significant safety risks to society. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defense mechanism: SafeTy Reasoning Elicitation Alignment for Multi-Turn Dialogues (STREAM). STREAM defends LLMs against multi-turn attacks while preserving their functional capabilities. Our approach involves constructing a human-annotated dataset, the Safety Reasoning Multi-turn Dialogues dataset, which is used to fine-tune a plug-and-play safety reasoning moderator. This model is designed to identify malicious intent hidden within multi-turn conversations and alert the target LLM of potential risks. We evaluate STREAM across multiple LLMs against prevalent multi-turn attack strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing defense techniques, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 51.2%, all while maintaining comparable LLM capability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3) recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test 3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors, highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings.

<title>From Argumentative Text to Argument Knowledge Graph: A New Framework for Structured Argumentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features. We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference over arguments and the relations between them.

Abstract: Unlike traditional cascaded pipelines, end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems preserve full differentiability and capture non-phonemic information, making them well-suited for modeling spoken interactions. However, existing E2E approaches often require large-scale training data and generates responses lacking semantic coherence. We propose a simple yet effective strategy leveraging a chain-of-thought (CoT) formulation, ensuring that training on conversational data remains closely aligned with the multimodal language model (LM)'s pre-training on speech recognition~(ASR), text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), and text LM tasks. Our method achieves over 1.5 ROUGE-1 improvement over the baseline, successfully training spoken dialogue systems on publicly available human-human conversation datasets, while being compute-efficient enough to train on just 300 hours of public human-human conversation data, such as the Switchboard. We will publicly release our models and training code.

arXiv:2506.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a gradient-informed fine-tuning method for large language models under few-shot conditions. The goal is to enhance task adaptability and training stability when data is limited. The method builds on a base loss function and introduces two gradient-related regularization terms. The first enforces gradient direction consistency to guide parameter updates along task-relevant directions and prevent drift. The second controls gradient magnitude to avoid abnormal updates. Together, these components support a more efficient and stable optimization path. To further improve cross-task generalization, the method incorporates a gradient alignment mechanism. This mechanism measures the consistency between optimization directions of the source and target tasks. It enhances fine-tuning performance in multi-task and cross-domain scenarios. Across various natural language understanding tasks, the method outperforms existing fine-tuning strategies in average accuracy, gradient stability, and directional alignment. Empirical evaluations under different sample sizes and domain-specific tasks confirm the method's robustness and broad applicability in low-resource environments. In particular, the method shows clear advantages in controlling parameter update paths. The results demonstrate that a gradient-based fine-tuning framework can effectively leverage the representational power of large language models. It ensures training stability while reducing dependence on large volumes of labeled data.

Abstract: Narrative frames are a powerful way of conceptualizing and communicating complex, controversial ideas, however automated frame analysis to date has mostly overlooked this framing device. In this paper, we connect elements of narrativity with fundamental aspects of framing, and present a framework which formalizes and operationalizes such aspects. We annotate and release a data set of news articles in the climate change domain, analyze the dominance of narrative frame components across political leanings, and test LLMs in their ability to predict narrative frames and their components. Finally, we apply our framework in an unsupervised way to elicit components of narrative framing in a second domain, the COVID-19 crisis, where our predictions are congruent with prior theoretical work showing the generalizability of our approach.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive capabilities in human language comprehension and reasoning, yet their potential in cybersecurity remains underexplored. We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons. An anonymized version of DefenderBench is available at https://github.com/microsoft/DefenderBench.

Abstract: In video dubbing, aligning translated audio with the source audio is a significant challenge. Our focus is on achieving this efficiently, tailored for real-time, on-device video dubbing scenarios. We developed a phoneme-based end-to-end length-sensitive speech translation (LSST) model, which generates translations of varying lengths short, normal, and long using predefined tags. Additionally, we introduced length-aware beam search (LABS), an efficient approach to generate translations of different lengths in a single decoding pass. This approach maintained comparable BLEU scores compared to a baseline without length awareness while significantly enhancing synchronization quality between source and target audio, achieving a mean opinion score (MOS) gain of 0.34 for Spanish and 0.65 for Korean, respectively.

Abstract: We propose Data Swarms, an algorithm to optimize the generation of synthetic evaluation data and advance quantitative desiderata of LLM evaluation. We first train a swarm of initial data generators using existing data, and define various evaluation objectives to reflect the desired properties of evaluation (e.g., generate more difficult problems for the evaluated models) and quantitatively evaluate data generators. We then employ particle swarm optimization to optimize the swarm of data generators, where they collaboratively search through the model parameter space to find new generators that advance these objectives. We further extend it to Adversarial Swarms, where the data generator swarm generates harder data while the test taker model swarm learns from such data, co-evolving dynamically for better data and models simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Data Swarms outperforms eight data generation baselines across five evaluation objectives, while Adversarial Swarms produce more robust learning of synthetic data and stronger generalization. Further analysis reveals that Data Swarms successfully optimizes compositions of multiple evaluation objectives and generalizes to new off-the-shelf LLMs, unseen at optimization time.

<title>Assortment of Attention Heads: Accelerating Federated PEFT with Head Pruning and Strategic Client Selection</title>

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the de-facto approach in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks in Natural Language Processing. However, its adoption in privacy-preserving distributed learning frameworks, such as Federated Learning (FL), remains relatively limited. This is mainly due to challenges specific to FL, such as resource-constrained devices and diverse data distributions among clients. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to perform PEFT within the FL framework for Multi-Head Attention (MHA) based language models. We address the challenges through head pruning, a novel head-specific weighted aggregation mechanism, and a client selection strategy. Head pruning minimizes training complexity within the clients, guided by the importance score computed based on the confidence of the attention head. Weighted aggregation of heads ensures the global model captures crucial updates from diverse clients complementing our client selection strategy. We show results on the MultiNLI benchmark along with 20 Newsgroups, XL-Sum, and E2E NLG datasets. We use the MultiNLI dataset and T5-small model with LoRA as our PEFT method, attaining sparsity levels of up to 90%, resulting in a communication advantage of up to 1.8x and a reduction in training OPs of 3.9x while maintaining the accuracy drop under 2%.

Abstract: Addressing gender bias and maintaining logical coherence in machine translation remains challenging, particularly when translating between natural gender languages, like English, and genderless languages, such as Persian, Indonesian, and Finnish. We introduce the Translate-with-Care (TWC) dataset, comprising 3,950 challenging scenarios across six low- to mid-resource languages, to assess translation systems' performance. Our analysis of diverse technologies, including GPT-4, mBART-50, NLLB-200, and Google Translate, reveals a universal struggle in translating genderless content, resulting in gender stereotyping and reasoning errors. All models preferred masculine pronouns when gender stereotypes could influence choices. Google Translate and GPT-4 showed particularly strong bias, favoring male pronouns 4-6 times more than feminine ones in leadership and professional success contexts. Fine-tuning mBART-50 on TWC substantially resolved these biases and errors, led to strong generalization, and surpassed proprietary LLMs while remaining open-source. This work emphasizes the need for targeted approaches to gender and semantic coherence in machine translation, particularly for genderless languages, contributing to more equitable and accurate translation systems.

<title>Understanding and Mitigating Cross-lingual Privacy Leakage via Language-specific and Universal Privacy Neurons</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00759</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive data capture rich information embedded in the training data. However, this also introduces the risk of privacy leakage, particularly involving personally identifiable information (PII). Although previous studies have shown that this risk can be mitigated through methods such as privacy neurons, they all assume that both the (sensitive) training data and user queries are in English. We show that they cannot defend against the privacy leakage in cross-lingual contexts: even if the training data is exclusively in one language, these (private) models may still reveal private information when queried in another language. In this work, we first investigate the information flow of cross-lingual privacy leakage to give a better understanding. We find that LLMs process private information in the middle layers, where representations are largely shared across languages. The risk of leakage peaks when converted to a language-specific space in later layers. Based on this, we identify privacy-universal neurons and language-specific privacy neurons. Privacy-universal neurons influence privacy leakage across all languages, while language-specific privacy neurons are only related to specific languages. By deactivating these neurons, the cross-lingual privacy leakage risk is reduced by 23.3%-31.6%.

<title>Dynamic Chunking and Selection for Reading Comprehension of Ultra-Long Context in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately read and comprehend extremely long texts. Current methods for improvement typically rely on splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains robustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to 256k tokens.

<title>Improving Automatic Evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Biomedical Relation Extraction via LLMs-as-the-Judge</title>

arXiv:2506.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in biomedical relation extraction, even in zero-shot scenarios. However, evaluating LLMs in this task remains challenging due to their ability to generate human-like text, often producing synonyms or abbreviations of gold-standard answers, making traditional automatic evaluation metrics unreliable. On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications. This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction. We benchmark 8 LLMs as judges to evaluate the responses generated by 5 other LLMs across 3 biomedical relation extraction datasets. Unlike other text-generation tasks, we observe that LLM-based judges perform quite poorly (usually below 50% accuracy) in the biomedical relation extraction task. Our findings reveal that it happens mainly because relations extracted by LLMs do not adhere to any standard format. To address this, we propose structured output formatting for LLM-generated responses that helps LLM-Judges to improve their performance by about 15% (on average). We also introduce a domain adaptation technique to further enhance LLM-Judge performance by effectively transferring knowledge between datasets. We release both our human-annotated and LLM-annotated judgment data (36k samples in total) for public use here: https://github.com/tahmedge/llm_judge_biomedical_re.

<title>KG-TRACES: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning and Attribution Supervision</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00783</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.

Abstract: Improving cultural competence of language technologies is important. However most recent works rarely engage with the communities they study, and instead rely on synthetic setups and imperfect proxies of culture. In this work, we take a human-centered approach to discover and measure language-based cultural norms, and cultural competence of LLMs. We focus on a single kind of culture, research cultures, and a single task, adapting writing across research cultures. Through a set of interviews with interdisciplinary researchers, who are experts at moving between cultures, we create a framework of structural, stylistic, rhetorical, and citational norms that vary across research cultures. We operationalise these features with a suite of computational metrics and use them for (a) surfacing latent cultural norms in human-written research papers at scale; and (b) highlighting the lack of cultural competence of LLMs, and their tendency to homogenise writing. Overall, our work illustrates the efficacy of a human-centered approach to measuring cultural norms in human-written and LLM-generated texts.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances recency and factuality in answers. However, existing evaluations rarely test how well these systems cope with real-world noise, conflicting between internal and external retrieved contexts, or fast-changing facts. We introduce Retrieval-Aware Robustness Evaluation (RARE), a unified framework and large-scale benchmark that jointly stress-tests query and document perturbations over dynamic, time-sensitive corpora. One of the central features of RARE is a knowledge-graph-driven synthesis pipeline (RARE-Get) that automatically extracts single and multi-hop relations from the customized corpus and generates multi-level question sets without manual intervention. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct a dataset (RARE-Set) spanning 400 expert-level time-sensitive finance, economics, and policy documents and 48,322 questions whose distribution evolves as the underlying sources change. To quantify resilience, we formalize retrieval-conditioned robustness metrics (RARE-Met) that capture a model's ability to remain correct or recover when queries, documents, or real-world retrieval results are systematically altered. Our results show that RAG systems exhibit surprising vulnerability to perturbations, with document robustness consistently being the weakest point regardless of generator size or architecture. RAG systems consistently show lower robustness on multi-hop queries than single-hop queries across all domains.

<title>Fast or Slow? Integrating Fast Intuition and Deliberate Thinking for Enhancing Visual Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with complex reasoning tasks in Visual Question Answering (VQA). While current methods have advanced by incorporating visual prompts, our study uncovers critical limitations: these approaches indiscriminately annotate all detected objects for every visual question, generating excessive visual markers that degrade task performance. This issue stems primarily from a lack of focus on key visual elements, raising two important questions: Are all objects equally important, and do all questions require visual prompts? Motivated by Dual Process Theory, which distinguishes between instinctive and deliberate cognitive modes in human reasoning, we propose FOCUS, a plug-and-play approach that dynamically adapts to the complexity of questions, combining fast intuitive judgments with deliberate analytical reasoning to enhance the vision-language reasoning capability of the MLLM. For straightforward questions, FOCUS supports efficient zero-shot reasoning. For more complex tasks, it employs the conceptualizing before observation strategy to highlight critical elements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks, ScienceQA, TextQA, VizWiz, and MME, demonstrate that FOCUS consistently improves the performance of both open-source and black-box MLLMs, achieving significant gains across all datasets. Ablation studies further validate the importance of combining diverse cognitive strategies with refined visual information for superior performance. Code will be released.

Abstract: We propose GuessBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on modeling the pervasive, noisy, and pluralistic human creativity. GuessBench sources data from "Guess the Build", an online multiplayer Minecraft minigame where one player constructs a Minecraft build given a concept (e.g. caterpillar) and others try to guess it with natural language hints, presenting a pristine testbed for sensemaking creativity in the wild with VLMs acting as guessers. We curate 1500 images from the actual gameplay and design 2000 problems spanning static and dynamic image settings, natural language hints of varying completeness, and more. Extensive experiments with six open/API VLMs and five reasoning enhancement approaches demonstrate that GuessBench presents a uniquely challenging task in creativity modeling: even the start-of-the-art GPT-4o is incorrect on 34% of instances, while we observe a huge performance gap (13.87% vs. 53.93% on average) between open and API models. When used as a resource to improve VLMs, fine-tuning on the reasoning traces for GuessBench problems improves visual perception tasks by 15.36% on average. Further analysis reveals that VLM performance in creativity sensemaking correlates with the frequency of the concept in training data, while the accuracy drops sharply for concepts in underrepresented cultural contexts and low-resource languages.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved natural language generation, including creative tasks like poetry composition. However, most progress remains concentrated in high-resource languages. This raises an important question: Can LLMs be adapted for structured poetic generation in a low-resource, morphologically rich language such as Sanskrit? In this work, we introduce a dataset designed for translating English prose into structured Sanskrit verse, with strict adherence to classical metrical patterns, particularly the Anushtub meter. We evaluate a range of generative models-both open-source and proprietary-under multiple settings. Specifically, we explore constrained decoding strategies and instruction-based fine-tuning tailored to metrical and semantic fidelity. Our decoding approach achieves over 99% accuracy in producing syntactically valid poetic forms, substantially outperforming general-purpose models in meter conformity. Meanwhile, instruction-tuned variants show improved alignment with source meaning and poetic style, as supported by human assessments, albeit with marginal trade-offs in metrical precision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge but struggle to stay up-to-date, often leading to errors and hallucinations. Knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a \weight token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances, ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models. Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the excessive reliance on the central model inherent in the model ensemble technique, making it more suitable for knowledge editing. Extensive experiments on diverse LLMs demonstrate that OnceEdit consistently outperforms existing methods while achieving superior editing efficiency. Further analysis confirms its adaptability and stability in multi-model editing scenarios. Our code will be available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive datasets that encapsulate substantial world knowledge. However, their outputs often include confidently stated inaccuracies. Earlier works suggest that LLMs encode truthfulness as a distinct linear feature, termed the "truth direction", which can classify truthfulness reliably. We address several open questions about the truth direction: (i) whether LLMs universally exhibit consistent truth directions; (ii) whether sophisticated probing techniques are necessary to identify truth directions; and (iii) how the truth direction generalizes across diverse contexts. Our findings reveal that not all LLMs exhibit consistent truth directions, with stronger representations observed in more capable models, particularly in the context of logical negation. Additionally, we demonstrate that truthfulness probes trained on declarative atomic statements can generalize effectively to logical transformations, question-answering tasks, in-context learning, and external knowledge sources. Finally, we explore the practical application of truthfulness probes in selective question-answering, illustrating their potential to improve user trust in LLM outputs. These results advance our understanding of truth directions and provide new insights into the internal representations of LLM beliefs.

Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs) by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion. Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing, which efficiently modifies the knowledge in large language models, has gathered great attention. Current benchmarks primarily use multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios, particularly when questions require complex reasoning, involving one-to-many relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological and model-specific perspectives. The datasets are available at https://github.com/kzjkzj666/CompKE.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to 17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward structured knowledge expertise.

Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

<title>How Bidirectionality Helps Language Models Learn Better via Dynamic Bottleneck Estimation</title>

Abstract: Bidirectional language models have better context understanding and perform better than unidirectional models on natural language understanding tasks, yet the theoretical reasons behind this advantage remain unclear. In this work, we investigate this disparity through the lens of the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which formalizes a trade-off between compressing input information and preserving task-relevant content. We propose FlowNIB, a dynamic and scalable method for estimating mutual information during training that addresses key limitations of classical IB approaches, including computational intractability and fixed trade-off schedules. Theoretically, we show that bidirectional models retain more mutual information and exhibit higher effective dimensionality than unidirectional models. To support this, we present a generalized framework for measuring representational complexity and prove that bidirectional representations are strictly more informative under mild conditions. We further validate our findings through extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks using FlowNIB, revealing how information is encoded and compressed throughout training. Together, our work provides a principled explanation for the effectiveness of bidirectional architectures and introduces a practical tool for analyzing information flow in deep language models.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt. GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union, Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models, BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks. The dataset and model are shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP

<title>What's Missing in Vision-Language Models? Probing Their Struggles with Causal Order Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on downstream tasks, their ability to understand and reason about causal relationships in visual inputs remains unclear. Robust causal reasoning is fundamental to solving complex high-level reasoning tasks, yet existing benchmarks often include a mixture of reasoning questions, and VLMs can frequently exploit object recognition and activity identification as shortcuts to arrive at the correct answers, making it challenging to truly assess their causal reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce VQA-Causal and VCR-Causal, two new benchmarks specifically designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate VLMs' causal reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal that while VLMs excel in object and activity recognition, they perform poorly on causal reasoning tasks, often only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further analysis suggests that this limitation stems from a severe lack of causal expressions in widely used training datasets, where causal relationships are rarely explicitly conveyed. We additionally explore fine-tuning strategies with hard negative cases, showing that targeted fine-tuning can improve model's causal reasoning while maintaining generalization and downstream performance. Our study highlights a key gap in current VLMs and lays the groundwork for future work on causal understanding.

<title>CC-Tuning: A Cross-Lingual Connection Mechanism for Improving Joint Multilingual Supervised Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often exhibit imbalanced multilingual capabilities due to their English-centric training corpora. To address this, existing fine-tuning approaches operating at the data-level (e.g., through data augmentation or distillation) typically introduce implicit cross-lingual alignment, overlooking the potential for more profound, latent-level cross-lingual interactions. In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the model to benefit from both linguistic resources. This process is facilitated with a trainable Decision Maker that identifies beneficial activations. Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation transformation. Our experiments on six benchmarks covering 22 languages show that CC-Tuning outperforms vanilla SFT and offers a strong latent-level alternative to data-level augmentation methods. Further analysis also highlights the practicality of CC-Tuning and the potential of latent-level cross-lingual interactions in advancing the multilingual performance of LLMs.

<title>Not Every Token Needs Forgetting: Selective Unlearning to Limit Change in Utility in Large Language Model Unlearning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning has recently gained significant attention, driven by the need to remove unwanted information, such as private, sensitive, or copyrighted content, from LLMs. However, conventional unlearning approaches indiscriminately update model parameters to forget all tokens in a target document, including common tokens (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, general nouns) that carry general knowledge. In this paper, we highlight that not every token needs forgetting. We propose Selective Unlearning (SU), which identifies a critical subset of tokens within the forgetting set that is relevant to the unwanted information, and unlearns only those tokens. Experiments on two benchmarks and six baseline unlearning algorithms demonstrate that SU not only achieves effective unlearning on the targeted forget data, but also significantly preserves the model's utility in the retaining set.

Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) has led to a wide range of MLLM applications, and a number of benchmark datasets have sprung up in order to assess MLLM abilities. However, full-coverage Q&amp;A testing on large-scale data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy, which aims to quickly obtain MLLM performance metrics by quizzing fewer question. First, First, we constructed the interview dataset, which was built on an existing MLLM assessment dataset, by adding difficulty labels based on the performance of some typical MLLMs in this dataset. Second, we propose an MLLM Interview strategy, which obtains an initial performance situation of the large model by quizzing a small number of topics and then continuously tries to test the model's limits. Through extensive experiments, the result shows that the MITV strategy proposed in this paper performs well on MLLM benchmark datasets, and it is able to obtain the model evaluation capability faster through a small number of questions and answers.

Abstract: Affordance theory posits that environments inherently offer action possibilities that shape perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, their ability to perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce A4Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance}, assessing understanding of inherent object properties through 1,282 question-answer pairs spanning nine sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs. Evaluating 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) against human performance, we find that proprietary models generally outperform open-source counterparts, but all exhibit limited capabilities, particularly in transformative affordance perception. Furthermore, even top-performing models, such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware interactions. The dataset is available in https://github.com/JunyingWang959/A4Bench/.

Abstract: LLMs exhibit promising Social Intelligence (SI) in modeling human behavior, raising the need to evaluate LLMs' SI and their discrepancy with humans. SI equips humans with interpersonal abilities to behave wisely in navigating social interactions to achieve social goals. This presents an operational evaluation paradigm: outcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation and process-oriented interpersonal ability evaluation, which existing work fails to address. To this end, we propose SocialEval, a script-based bilingual SI benchmark, integrating outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually crafting narrative scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that contains plot lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive view of how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer more positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure. Analysis of LLMs' formed representation space and neuronal activations reveals that LLMs have developed ability-specific functional partitions akin to the human brain.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL transforms the user queries from natural language to executable SQL programs, enabling non-experts to interact with complex databases. Existing prompt-based methods craft meticulous text guidelines and examples to facilitate SQL generation, but their accuracy is hindered by the large semantic gap between the texts and the low-resource SQL programs. In this work, we propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular, Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program following the guidance of each Python program.The final SQL program matches the reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performing baseline.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.

Abstract: Compositionality is a key aspect of human intelligence, essential for reasoning and generalization. While transformer-based models have become the de facto standard for many language modeling tasks, little is known about how they represent compound words, and whether these representations are compositional. In this study, we test compositionality in Mistral, OpenAI Large, and Google embedding models, and compare them with BERT. First, we evaluate compositionality in the representations by examining six diverse models of compositionality (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.). We find that ridge regression, albeit linear, best accounts for compositionality. Surprisingly, we find that the classic vector addition model performs almost as well as any other model. Next, we verify that most embedding models are highly compositional, while BERT shows much poorer compositionality. We verify and visualize our findings with a synthetic dataset consisting of fully transparent adjective-noun compositions. Overall, we present a thorough investigation of compositionality.

Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs.

Abstract: Sarcasm fundamentally alters meaning through tone and context, yet detecting it in speech remains a challenge due to data scarcity. In addition, existing detection systems often rely on multimodal data, limiting their applicability in contexts where only speech is available. To address this, we propose an annotation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a sarcasm dataset. Using a publicly available sarcasm-focused podcast, we employ GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 for initial sarcasm annotations, followed by human verification to resolve disagreements. We validate this approach by comparing annotation quality and detection performance on a publicly available sarcasm dataset using a collaborative gating architecture. Finally, we introduce PodSarc, a large-scale sarcastic speech dataset created through this pipeline. The detection model achieves a 73.63% F1 score, demonstrating the dataset's potential as a benchmark for sarcasm detection research.

<title>From Objectives to Questions: A Planning-based Framework for Educational Mathematical Question Generation</title>

Abstract: Automatically generating high-quality mathematical problems that align with educational objectives is a crucial task in NLP-based educational technology. Traditional generation methods focus primarily on textual quality, but they often overlook educational objectives. Moreover, these methods address only single-dimensional, simple question generation, failing to meet complex, multifaceted educational requirements. To address these challenges, we constructed and annotated EduMath, a dataset of 16k mathematical questions with multi-dimensional educational objectives. Based on this dataset, we developed EQGEVAL, which incorporates three evaluation dimensions and is designed to assess the ability of models to generate educational questions. Drawing inspiration from teachers' problem design processes, we propose the Educational Question Planning with self-Reflection (EQPR) method for educational mathematical question generation, following a "plan-evaluate-optimize" approach. Specifically, by combining planning algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models, we continuously optimize questions through iterative feedback. This self-optimization mechanism ensures that the generated questions both fit the educational context and strategically achieve specific basic educational objectives. Through extensive experiments based on EQGEVAL, we have demonstrated that EQPR achieves significant improvements in generating questions that meet multi-dimensional educational objectives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming valuable to corporate data management due to their ability to process text from various document formats and facilitate user interactions through natural language queries. However, LLMs must consider the sensitivity of information when communicating with employees, especially given access restrictions. Simple filtering based on user clearance levels can pose both performance and privacy challenges. To address this, we propose the concept of sensitivity awareness (SA), which enables LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. In addition, we developed a benchmarking environment called ACCESS DENIED INC to evaluate SA. Our experimental findings reveal significant variations in model behavior, particularly in managing unauthorized data requests while effectively addressing legitimate queries. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking sensitivity-aware language models and provides insights to enhance privacy-centric AI systems in corporate environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content spanning ideological rhetoric to explicit instructions for violence. However, existing safety evaluations often rely on simplistic binary labels (safe and unsafe), overlooking the nuanced spectrum of risk these outputs pose. To address this, we present XGUARD, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the severity of extremist content generated by LLMs. XGUARD includes 3,840 red teaming prompts sourced from real world data such as social media and news, covering a broad range of ideologically charged scenarios. Our framework categorizes model responses into five danger levels (0 to 4), enabling a more nuanced analysis of both the frequency and severity of failures. We introduce the interpretable Attack Severity Curve (ASC) to visualize vulnerabilities and compare defense mechanisms across threat intensities. Using XGUARD, we evaluate six popular LLMs and two lightweight defense strategies, revealing key insights into current safety gaps and trade-offs between robustness and expressive freedom. Our work underscores the value of graded safety metrics for building trustworthy LLMs.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.

Abstract: This paper presents LEMONADE, a large-scale conflict event dataset comprising 39,786 events across 20 languages and 171 countries, with extensive coverage of region-specific entities. LEMONADE is based on a partially reannotated subset of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which has documented global conflict events for over a decade.
  To address the challenge of aggregating multilingual sources for global event analysis, we introduce abstractive event extraction (AEE) and its subtask, abstractive entity linking (AEL). Unlike conventional span-based event extraction, our approach detects event arguments and entities through holistic document understanding and normalizes them across the multilingual dataset. We evaluate various large language models (LLMs) on these tasks, adapt existing zero-shot event extraction systems, and benchmark supervised models. Additionally, we introduce ZEST, a novel zero-shot retrieval-based system for AEL.
  Our best zero-shot system achieves an end-to-end F1 score of 58.3%, with LLMs outperforming specialized event extraction models such as GoLLIE. For entity linking, ZEST achieves an F1 score of 45.7%, significantly surpassing OneNet, a state-of-the-art zero-shot baseline that achieves only 23.7%. However, these zero-shot results lag behind the best supervised systems by 20.1% and 37.0% in the end-to-end and AEL tasks, respectively, highlighting the need for further research.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings. However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.

Abstract: Diary analysis presents challenges, particularly in extracting meaningful information from large corpora, where traditional methods often fail to deliver satisfactory results. This study introduces a novel method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and cluster the various purposes of diary writing. By "purposes," we refer to the intentions behind diary writing, such as documenting life events, self-reflection, or practicing language skills. Our approach is applied to Soviet-era diaries (1922-1929) from the Prozhito digital archive, a rich collection of personal narratives. We evaluate different proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that GPT-4o and o1-mini achieve the best performance, while a template-based baseline is significantly less effective. Additionally, we analyze the retrieved purposes based on gender, age of the authors, and the year of writing. Furthermore, we examine the types of errors made by the models, providing a deeper understanding of their limitations and potential areas for improvement in future research.

Abstract: Access to humanities research databases is often hindered by the limitations of traditional interaction formats, particularly in the methods of searching and response generation. This study introduces an LLM-based smart assistant designed to facilitate natural language communication with digital humanities data. The assistant, developed in a chatbot format, leverages the RAG approach and integrates state-of-the-art technologies such as hybrid search, automatic query generation, text-to-SQL filtering, semantic database search, and hyperlink insertion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, experiments were conducted to assess the response quality of various language models. The testing was based on the Prozhito digital archive, which contains diary entries from predominantly Russian-speaking individuals who lived in the 20th century. The chatbot is tailored to support anthropology and history researchers, as well as non-specialist users with an interest in the field, without requiring prior technical training. By enabling researchers to query complex databases with natural language, this tool aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency in humanities research. The study highlights the potential of Large Language Models to transform the way researchers and the public interact with digital archives, making them more intuitive and inclusive.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

Abstract: Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their internal mechanisms by linking neural representations to interpretable semantics. However, how neurons functionally co-activate with each other to give rise to emergent capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity topology of LLM neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By analyzing internal neural graphs across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural topology. This predictability is robust even when retaining just 1% of neuron connections or probing models after only 8 pretraining steps, highlighting the sparsity and early emergence of topological patterns. Further graph matching analysis suggests that, despite significant distinctions in architectures, parameters, and training data, different LLMs develop intricate and consistent neural topological structures that may form the foundation for their language generation abilities. Codes and data for the graph probing toolbox are released at https://github.com/DavyMorgan/llm-graph-probing.

Abstract: Emotions manifest through physical experiences and bodily reactions, yet identifying such embodied emotions in text remains understudied. We present an embodied emotion classification dataset, CHEER-Ekman, extending the existing binary embodied emotion dataset with Ekman's six basic emotion categories. Using automatic best-worst scaling with large language models, we achieve performance superior to supervised approaches on our new dataset. Our investigation reveals that simplified prompting instructions and chain-of-thought reasoning significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy, enabling smaller models to achieve competitive performance with larger ones.

<title>SealQA: Raising the Bar for Reasoning in Search-Augmented Language Models</title>

Abstract: We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors: (1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3) LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors. On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally, while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.

<title>How Programming Concepts and Neurons Are Shared in Code Language Models</title>

Abstract: Several studies have explored the mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) in coding tasks, but most have focused on programming languages (PLs) in a monolingual setting. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between multiple PLs and English in the concept space of LLMs. We perform a few-shot translation task on 21 PL pairs using two Llama-based models. By decoding the embeddings of intermediate layers during this task, we observe that the concept space is closer to English (including PL keywords) and assigns high probabilities to English tokens in the second half of the intermediate layers. We analyze neuron activations for 11 PLs and English, finding that while language-specific neurons are primarily concentrated in the bottom layers, those exclusive to each PL tend to appear in the top layers. For PLs that are highly aligned with multiple other PLs, identifying language-specific neurons is not feasible. These PLs also tend to have a larger keyword set than other PLs and are closer to the model's concept space regardless of the input/output PL in the translation task. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs internally represent PLs, revealing structural patterns in the model's concept space. Code is available at https://github.com/cisnlp/code-specific-neurons.

<title>zip2zip: Inference-Time Adaptive Vocabularies for Language Models via Token Compression</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01084</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers optimized for general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a framework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference time, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable "hypertokens" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant that trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences. We show that an existing LLM can be zip2zip-fied in 10 GPU-hours via parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting zip2zip LLMs effectively learn to use hypertokens at inference time, reducing input and output sequence length by 20-60\%, with significant improvements in inference latency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in tasks related to coreference resolution. However, previous studies mostly assessed LLM performance on coreference resolution with nouns and third person pronouns. This study evaluates LLM performance on coreference resolution with indexical like I, you, here and tomorrow, which come with unique challenges due to their linguistic properties. We present the first study examining how LLMs interpret indexicals in English, releasing the English Indexical Dataset with 1600 multiple-choice questions. We evaluate pioneering LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and DeepSeek V3. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit an impressive performance with some indexicals (I), while struggling with others (you, here, tomorrow), and that syntactic cues (e.g. quotation) contribute to LLM performance with some indexicals, while they reduce performance with others. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/metehanoguzz/LLMs-Indexicals-English.

<title>Contextual Candor: Enhancing LLM Trustworthiness Through Hierarchical Unanswerability Detection</title>

arXiv:2506.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pervasive deployment of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI systems has revolutionized information access, yet their propensity for generating factually unsupported or hallucinated responses remains a critical impediment to trustworthiness and widespread adoption. This paper introduces Reinforced Unanswerability Learning (RUL), a novel hybrid training paradigm designed to imbue LLMs with the intrinsic capability to accurately detect unanswerable questions and generate reliably appropriate responses. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on external classifiers or simple prompting, RUL integrates a discriminative unanswerability prediction head with the LLM's generative core, guided by a multi-stage learning strategy. This includes supervised fine-tuning on a novel, richly annotated dataset, Enhanced-CAsT-Answerability (ECA), which features hierarchical answerability labels and ground-truth refusal responses. Crucially, RUL incorporates a subsequent reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase to refine the nuance, helpfulness, and informativeness of refusal responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate RUL's superior performance, achieving significantly higher accuracy in unanswerability detection across sentence, paragraph, and ranking levels, and substantially increasing the generation of appropriate refusals for unanswerable queries, alongside strong performance on answerable questions. Human evaluations further corroborate RUL's effectiveness, highlighting a marked improvement in perceived helpfulness and trustworthiness, ultimately paving the way for more reliable and user-centric conversational AI.

arXiv:2506.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated that systems trained solely on text can acquire extensive world knowledge, develop reasoning capabilities, and internalize abstract semantic concepts--showcasing properties that can be associated with general intelligence. This raises an intriguing question: Do such concepts emerge in models trained on other modalities, such as speech? Furthermore, when models are trained jointly on multiple modalities: Do they develop a richer, more structured semantic understanding? To explore this, we analyze the conceptual structures learned by speech and textual models both individually and jointly. We employ Latent Concept Analysis, an unsupervised method for uncovering and interpreting latent representations in neural networks, to examine how semantic abstractions form across modalities. For reproducibility we made scripts and other resources available to the community.

<title>A Word is Worth 4-bit: Efficient Log Parsing with Binary Coded Decimal Recognition</title>

arXiv:2506.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System-generated logs are typically converted into categorical log templates through parsing. These templates are crucial for generating actionable insights in various downstream tasks. However, existing parsers often fail to capture fine-grained template details, leading to suboptimal accuracy and reduced utility in downstream tasks requiring precise pattern identification. We propose a character-level log parser utilizing a novel neural architecture that aggregates character embeddings. Our approach estimates a sequence of binary-coded decimals to achieve highly granular log templates extraction. Our low-resource character-level parser, tested on revised Loghub-2k and a manually annotated industrial dataset, matches LLM-based parsers in accuracy while outperforming semantic parsers in efficiency.

<title>Mispronunciation Detection Without L2 Pronunciation Dataset in Low-Resource Setting: A Case Study in Finland Swedish</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mispronunciation detection (MD) models are the cornerstones of many language learning applications. Unfortunately, most systems are built for English and other major languages, while low-resourced language varieties, such as Finland Swedish (FS), lack such tools. In this paper, we introduce our MD model for FS, trained on 89 hours of first language (L1) speakers' spontaneous speech and tested on 33 minutes of L2 transcribed read-aloud speech.
  We trained a multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model with entropy regularization, followed by temperature scaling and top-k normalization after the inference to better adapt it for MD. The main novelty of our method lies in its simplicity, requiring minimal L2 data. The process is also language-independent, making it suitable for other low-resource languages. Our proposed algorithm allows us to balance Recall (43.2%) and Precision (29.8%), compared with the baseline model's Recall (77.5%) and Precision (17.6%).

<title>The Inverse Scaling Effect of Pre-Trained Language Model Surprisal Is Not Due to Data Leakage</title>

arXiv:2506.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In psycholinguistic modeling, surprisal from larger pre-trained language models has been shown to be a poorer predictor of naturalistic human reading times. However, it has been speculated that this may be due to data leakage that caused language models to see the text stimuli during training. This paper presents two studies to address this concern at scale. The first study reveals relatively little leakage of five naturalistic reading time corpora in two pre-training datasets in terms of length and frequency of token $n$-gram overlap. The second study replicates the negative relationship between language model size and the fit of surprisal to reading times using models trained on 'leakage-free' data that overlaps only minimally with the reading time corpora. Taken together, this suggests that previous results using language models trained on these corpora are not driven by the effects of data leakage.

<title>LAQuer: Localized Attribution Queries in Content-grounded Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grounded text generation models often produce content that deviates from their source material, requiring user verification to ensure accuracy. Existing attribution methods associate entire sentences with source documents, which can be overwhelming for users seeking to fact-check specific claims. In contrast, existing sub-sentence attribution methods may be more precise but fail to align with users' interests. In light of these limitations, we introduce Localized Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task that localizes selected spans of generated output to their corresponding source spans, allowing fine-grained and user-directed attribution. We compare two approaches for the LAQuer task, including prompting large language models (LLMs) and leveraging LLM internal representations. We then explore a modeling framework that extends existing attributed text generation methods to LAQuer. We evaluate this framework across two grounded text generation tasks: Multi-document Summarization (MDS) and Long-form Question Answering (LFQA). Our findings show that LAQuer methods significantly reduce the length of the attributed text. Our contributions include: (1) proposing the LAQuer task to enhance attribution usability, (2) suggesting a modeling framework and benchmarking multiple baselines, and (3) proposing a new evaluation setting to promote future research on localized attribution in content-grounded generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with culturally-specific reasoning tasks, particularly in low-resource languages, hindering their global applicability. Addressing this gap is crucial for equitable AI deployment. We introduce Culturally-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (CG-CoT), a novel prompting strategy that combines dense vector retrieval of cultural context with explicit reasoning sequences. Our extensive experiments on Yoruba proverb interpretation demonstrate that CG-CoT provides significantly higher culturally-aligned accuracy and depth than traditional prompting methods, validated through both automated metrics and LLM-based evaluations. Notably, we uncover stark disparities between token-level translation metrics like BLEU and human-judged cultural relevance, suggesting a rethinking of evaluation approaches for low-resource NLP.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language is often used strategically, particularly in high-stakes, adversarial settings, yet most work on pragmatics and LLMs centers on cooperativity. This leaves a gap in systematic understanding of non-cooperative discourse. To address this, we introduce CoBRA (Cooperation-Breach Response Assessment), along with three interpretable metrics -- Benefit at Turn (BaT), Penalty at Turn (PaT), and Normalized Relative Benefit at Turn (NRBaT) -- to quantify the perceived strategic effects of discourse moves. We also present CHARM, an annotated dataset of real courtroom cross-examinations, to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Using these tools, we evaluate a range of LLMs and show that LLMs generally exhibit limited pragmatic understanding of strategic language. While model size shows an increase in performance on our metrics, reasoning ability does not help and largely hurts, introducing overcomplication and internal confusion.

arXiv:2506.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (and, in particular, sparse autoencoders) attempts to learn a set of human-understandable concepts that can explain variation on an abstract space. A basic limitation of this approach is that it neither exploits nor represents the semantic relationships between the learned concepts. In this paper, we introduce a modified SAE architecture that explicitly models a semantic hierarchy of concepts. Application of this architecture to the internal representations of large language models shows both that semantic hierarchy can be learned, and that doing so improves both reconstruction and interpretability. Additionally, the architecture leads to significant improvements in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Detecting ambiguity is important for language understanding, including uncertainty estimation, humour detection, and processing garden path sentences. We assess language models' sensitivity to ambiguity by introducing an adversarial ambiguity dataset that includes syntactic, lexical, and phonological ambiguities along with adversarial variations (e.g., word-order changes, synonym replacements, and random-based alterations). Our findings show that direct prompting fails to robustly identify ambiguity, while linear probes trained on model representations can decode ambiguity with high accuracy, sometimes exceeding 90\%. Our results offer insights into the prompting paradigm and how language models encode ambiguity at different layers. We release both our code and data: https://github.com/coastalcph/lm_ambiguity.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerating large language model (LLM) generation using a fast drafter while maintaining alignment with the target model's distribution. However, existing approaches face a trade-off: external drafters offer flexibility but can suffer from slower drafting, while self-speculation methods use drafters tailored to the target model but require re-training. In this paper, we introduce novel drafters based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art state space model (SSM), as a solution that combines the best aspects of both approaches. By leveraging the linear structure of SSMs, our approach avoids the quadratic complexity inherent in traditional Transformer-based methods, enabling faster drafting and lower memory usage while maintaining the flexibility to work across different target models. We further enhance efficiency with a novel test-time tree search algorithm for generating high-quality draft candidates. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Mamba-based drafters not only outperform existing external drafting methods but are also comparable to state-of-the-art self-speculation approaches while using less memory and maintaining their cross-model adaptability.

arXiv:2506.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models increasingly gain popularity in real-world applications, processing extremely long contexts, often exceeding the model's pre-trained context limits, has emerged as a critical challenge. While existing approaches to efficient long-context processing show promise, recurrent compression-based methods struggle with information preservation, whereas random access approaches require substantial memory resources. We introduce REFORM, a novel inference framework that efficiently handles long contexts through a two-phase approach. First, it incrementally processes input chunks while maintaining a compressed KV cache, constructs cross-layer context embeddings, and utilizes early exit strategy for improved efficiency. Second, it identifies and gathers essential tokens via similarity matching and selectively recomputes the KV cache. Compared to baselines, REFORM achieves over 50% and 27% performance gains on RULER and BABILong respectively at 1M context length. It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench and MM-NIAH, demonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally, REFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving both efficiency and superior performance.

Abstract: We introduce the $\underline{Ko}rean \underline{G}rammar \underline{E}valuation Bench\underline{M}ark (KoGEM)$, designed to assess the linguistic competence of LLMs and humans in Korean. KoGEM consists of 1.5k multiple-choice QA pairs covering five main categories and 16 subcategories. The zero-shot evaluation of 27 LLMs of various sizes and types reveals that while LLMs perform remarkably well on straightforward tasks requiring primarily definitional knowledge, they struggle with tasks that demand the integration of real-world experiential knowledge, such as phonological rules and pronunciation. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis suggests that incorporating such experiential knowledge could enhance the linguistic competence of LLMs. With KoGEM, we not only highlight the limitations of current LLMs in linguistic competence but also uncover hidden facets of LLMs in linguistic competence, paving the way for enhancing comprehensive language understanding. Our code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/SungHo3268/KoGEM.

Abstract: This paper introduces ExpertLongBench, an expert-level benchmark containing 11 tasks from 9 domains that reflect realistic expert workflows and applications. Beyond question answering, the application-driven tasks in ExpertLongBench demand long-form outputs that can exceed 5,000 tokens and strict adherence to domain-specific requirements. Notably, each task in ExpertLongBench includes a rubric, designed or validated by domain experts, to specify task requirements and guide output evaluation. Furthermore, we propose CLEAR, an evaluation framework that supports accurate evaluation of long-form model outputs in our benchmark. To achieve fine-grained, expert-aligned evaluation, CLEAR derives checklists from both model outputs and references by extracting information corresponding to items in the task-specific rubric. Checklist items for model outputs are then compared with corresponding items for reference outputs to assess their correctness, enabling grounded evaluation. We benchmark 11 large language models (LLMs) and analyze components in CLEAR, showing that (1) existing LLMs, with the top performer achieving only a 26.8% F1 score, require significant improvement for expert-level tasks; (2) models can generate content corresponding to the required aspects, though often not accurately; and (3) accurate checklist extraction and comparison in CLEAR can be achieved by open-weight models for more scalable and low-cost usage.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a holistic medical system with millennia of accumulated clinical experience, playing a vital role in global healthcare-particularly across East Asia. However, the implicit reasoning, diverse textual forms, and lack of standardization in TCM pose major challenges for computational modeling and evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in processing natural language across diverse domains, including general medicine. Yet, their systematic evaluation in the TCM domain remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks either focus narrowly on factual question answering or lack domain-specific tasks and clinical realism. To fill this gap, we introduce MTCMB-a Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on TCM Knowledge, Reasoning, and Safety. Developed in collaboration with certified TCM experts, MTCMB comprises 12 sub-datasets spanning five major categories: knowledge QA, language understanding, diagnostic reasoning, prescription generation, and safety evaluation. The benchmark integrates real-world case records, national licensing exams, and classical texts, providing an authentic and comprehensive testbed for TCM-capable models. Preliminary results indicate that current LLMs perform well on foundational knowledge but fall short in clinical reasoning, prescription planning, and safety compliance. These findings highlight the urgent need for domain-aligned benchmarks like MTCMB to guide the development of more competent and trustworthy medical AI systems. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are publicly available at: https://github.com/Wayyuanyuan/MTCMB.

Abstract: Knowing which latent conditions lead to a particular outcome is useful for critically examining claims made about complex event outcomes. Identifying implied conditions and examining their influence on an outcome is challenging. We handle this by combining and augmenting annotations from two existing datasets consisting of goals and states, and explore the influence of conditions through our research questions and Condition-based Reasoning tasks. We examine open and closed LLMs of varying sizes and intent-alignment on our reasoning tasks and find that conditions are useful when not all context is available. Models differ widely in their ability to generate and identify outcome-variant conditions which affects their performance on outcome validation when conditions are used to replace missing context. Larger models like GPT-4o, are more cautious in such less constrained situations.

<title>Memory-Efficient FastText: A Comprehensive Approach Using Double-Array Trie Structures and Mark-Compact Memory Management</title>

Abstract: FastText has established itself as a fundamental algorithm for learning word representations, demonstrating exceptional capability in handling out-of-vocabulary words through character-level n-gram embeddings. However, its hash-based bucketing mechanism introduces critical limitations for large-scale industrial deployment: hash collisions cause semantic drift, and memory requirements become prohibitively expensive when dealing with real-world vocabularies containing millions of terms. This paper presents a comprehensive memory optimization framework that fundamentally reimagines FastText's memory management through the integration of double-array trie (DA-trie) structures and mark-compact garbage collection principles. Our approach leverages the linguistic insight that n-grams sharing common prefixes or suffixes exhibit highly correlated embeddings due to co-occurrence patterns in natural language. By systematically identifying and merging semantically similar embeddings based on structural relationships, we achieve compression ratios of 4:1 to 10:1 while maintaining near-perfect embedding quality. The algorithm consists of four sophisticated phases: prefix trie construction with embedding mapping, prefix-based similarity compression, suffix-based similarity compression, and mark-compact memory reorganization. Comprehensive experiments on a 30-million Chinese vocabulary dataset demonstrate memory reduction from over 100GB to approximately 30GB with negligible performance degradation. Our industrial deployment results show significant cost reduction, faster loading times, and improved model reliability through the elimination of hash collision artifacts.

Abstract: Personalized AI assistants, a hallmark of the human-like capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are a challenging application that intertwines multiple problems in LLM research. Despite the growing interest in the development of personalized assistants, the lack of an open-source conversational dataset tailored for personalization remains a significant obstacle for researchers in the field. To address this research gap, we introduce HiCUPID, a new benchmark to probe and unleash the potential of LLMs to deliver personalized responses. Alongside a conversational dataset, HiCUPID provides a Llama-3.2-based automated evaluation model whose assessment closely mirrors human preferences. We release our dataset, evaluation model, and code at https://github.com/12kimih/HiCUPID.

<title>WCTC-Biasing: Retraining-free Contextual Biasing ASR with Wildcard CTC-based Keyword Spotting and Inter-layer Biasing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01263</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01263</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in end-to-end speech recognition methods, the output tends to be biased to the training data's vocabulary, resulting in inaccurate recognition of proper nouns and other unknown terms. To address this issue, we propose a method to improve recognition accuracy of such rare words in CTC-based models without additional training or text-to-speech systems. Specifically, keyword spotting is performed using acoustic features of intermediate layers during inference, and a bias is applied to the subsequent layers of the acoustic model for detected keywords. For keyword detection, we adopt a wildcard CTC that is both fast and tolerant of ambiguous matches, allowing flexible handling of words that are difficult to match strictly. Since this method does not require retraining of existing models, it can be easily applied to even large-scale models. In experiments on Japanese speech recognition, the proposed method achieved a 29% improvement in the F1 score for unknown words.

<title>Beyond In-Context Learning: Aligning Long-form Generation of Large Language Models via Task-Inherent Attribute Guidelines</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01265</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01265</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is an important yet not fully understood ability of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). It can greatly enhance task performance using a few examples, termed demonstrations, without fine-tuning. Although effective in question answering, ICL often underperforms in long-form generation tasks such as summarization. Under appropriately realistic assumptions, we empirically and theoretically show that ICL demonstrations alone are insufficient to teach LLMs the task language and format distributions for generation. We argue for explicit exposure to the task distributions and hypothesize that defining them by prompting enhances model performance. To this end, we present LongGuide, which efficiently generates two parallel streams of guidelines capturing task language and format properties: (i) Metric Guidelines (MGs) that instruct models to optimize self-evaluated metrics; and (ii) Output Constraint Guidelines (OCGs) that constrain generation at both token and sentence levels. LongGuide automatically selects the best combination of guidelines, improving both strong open- and closed-source LLMs by over 5% in both zero- and few-shot settings. We show that LongGuide is generalizable, learnable by weak models to enhance strong ones, and integrates synergistically with automatic prompt optimizers.

<title>Detoxification of Large Language Models through Output-layer Fusion with a Calibration Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01266</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing approaches for Large language model (LLM) detoxification generally rely on training on large-scale non-toxic or human-annotated preference data, designing prompts to instruct the LLM to generate safe content, or modifying the model parameters to remove toxic information, which are computationally expensive, lack robustness, and often compromise LLMs' fluency and contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for LLM detoxification, which leverages a compact, pre-trained calibration model that guides the detoxification process of a target LLM via a lightweight intervention in its generation pipeline. By learning a detoxified embedding space from non-toxic data, the calibration model effectively steers the LLM away from generating harmful content. This approach only requires a one-time training of the calibration model that is able to be seamlessly applied to multiple LLMs without compromising fluency or contextual understanding. Experiment results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces toxicity while maintaining reasonable content expression.

<title>Schema as Parameterized Tools for Universal Information Extraction</title>

Abstract: Universal information extraction (UIE) primarily employs an extractive generation approach with large language models (LLMs), typically outputting structured information based on predefined schemas such as JSON or tables. UIE suffers from a lack of adaptability when selecting between predefined schemas and on-the-fly schema generation within the in-context learning paradigm, especially when there are numerous schemas to choose from. In this paper, we propose a unified adaptive text-to-structure generation framework, called Schema as Parameterized Tools (SPT), which reimagines the tool-calling capability of LLMs by treating predefined schemas as parameterized tools for tool selection and parameter filling. Specifically, our SPT method can be applied to unify closed, open, and on-demand IE tasks by adopting Schema Retrieval by fetching the relevant schemas from a predefined pool, Schema Filling by extracting information and filling slots as with tool parameters, or Schema Generation by synthesizing new schemas with uncovered cases. Experiments show that the SPT method can handle four distinct IE tasks adaptively, delivering robust schema retrieval and selection performance. SPT also achieves comparable extraction performance to LoRA baselines and current leading UIE systems with significantly fewer trainable parameters.

Abstract: Medical benchmarks are indispensable for evaluating the capabilities of language models in healthcare for non-English-speaking communities,therefore help ensuring the quality of real-life applications. However, not every community has sufficient resources and standardized methods to effectively build and design such benchmark, and available non-English medical data is normally fragmented and difficult to verify. We developed an approach to tackle this problem and applied it to create the first Vietnamese medical question benchmark, featuring 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 34 medical specialties. Our benchmark was constructed using various verifiable sources, including carefully curated medical exams and clinical records, and eventually annotated by medical experts. The benchmark includes four difficulty levels, ranging from foundational biological knowledge commonly found in textbooks to typical clinical case studies that require advanced reasoning. This design enables assessment of both the breadth and depth of language models' medical understanding in the target language thanks to its extensive coverage and in-depth subject-specific expertise. We release the benchmark in three parts: a sample public set (4k questions), a full public set (10k questions), and a private set (2k questions) used for leaderboard evaluation. Each set contains all medical subfields and difficulty levels. Our approach is scalable to other languages, and we open-source our data construction pipeline to support the development of future multilingual benchmarks in the medical domain.

Abstract: A recent rise in online content expressing concerns with public health initiatives has contributed to already stalled uptake of preemptive measures globally. Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content, what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it. To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly, automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency before and after significant events.

<title>Growing Through Experience: Scaling Episodic Grounding in Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01312</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) require robust episodic grounding-the capacity to learn from and apply past experiences-to excel at physical planning tasks. Current episodic grounding approaches struggle with scalability and integration, limiting their effectiveness, especially for medium-sized LMs (7B parameters). While larger LMs (70-405B parameters) possess superior hierarchical representations and extensive pre-trained knowledge, they encounter a fundamental scale paradox: despite their advanced abstraction capabilities, they lack efficient mechanisms to leverage experience streams. We propose a scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that effectively transfers episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. This framework integrates Monte Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel distillation method, preserving the inherent LM capabilities while embedding episodic memory. Experiments demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and question-answering tasks. Layer-wise probing further indicates significant improvements in task alignment, especially within deeper LM layers, highlighting stable generalization even for previously unseen scenarios with increased planning complexity-conditions where baseline methods degrade markedly.

<title>Evaluating Large Language Models in Crisis Detection: A Real-World Benchmark from Psychological Support Hotlines</title>

arXiv:2506.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychological support hotlines are critical for crisis intervention but face significant challenges due to rising demand. Large language models (LLMs) could support crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive contexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540 annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline, assessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection, suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across 15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with statistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779), and risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood status recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost vocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) surpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like QwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though closed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled with size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with minimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured psychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition remains limited due to contextual complexity. The narrowing gap between open- and closed-source models, combined with efficient quantization, suggests feasible integration. PsyCrisisBench offers a robust evaluation framework to guide model development and ethical deployment in mental health.

<title>Enhancing Interpretable Image Classification Through LLM Agents and Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) decompose image classification into a process governed by interpretable, human-readable concepts. Recent advances in CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts. However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in traditional CBMs' concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of assessing each concept's contribution to classification tasks and feature an editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with their internal knowledge. Our evaluations across 6 datasets show that our method not only improves classification accuracy by 6% but also enhances interpretability assessments by 30%.

Abstract: The emergence of ChatGPT marked a transformative milestone for Artificial Intelligence (AI), showcasing the remarkable potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like text. This wave of innovation has revolutionized how we interact with technology, seamlessly integrating LLMs into everyday tasks such as vacation planning, email drafting, and content creation. While English-speaking users have significantly benefited from these advancements, the Arabic world faces distinct challenges in developing Arabic-specific LLMs. Arabic, one of the languages spoken most widely around the world, serves more than 422 million native speakers in 27 countries and is deeply rooted in a rich linguistic and cultural heritage. Developing Arabic LLMs (ALLMs) presents an unparalleled opportunity to bridge technological gaps and empower communities. The journey of ALLMs has been both fascinating and complex, evolving from rudimentary text processing systems to sophisticated AI-driven models. This article explores the trajectory of ALLMs, from their inception to the present day, highlighting the efforts to evaluate these models through benchmarks and public leaderboards. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities that ALLMs present for the Arab world.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite impressive advances in large language models (LLMs), existing benchmarks often focus on single-turn or single-step tasks, failing to capture the kind of iterative reasoning required in real-world settings. To address this limitation, we introduce TurnBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates multi-turn, multi-step reasoning through an interactive code-breaking task inspired by a "Turing Machine Board Game." In each episode, a model must uncover hidden logical or arithmetic rules by making sequential guesses, receiving structured feedback, and integrating clues across multiple rounds. This dynamic setup requires models to reason over time, adapt based on past information, and maintain consistency across steps-capabilities underexplored in current benchmarks. TurnBench includes two modes: Classic, which tests standard reasoning, and Nightmare, which introduces increased complexity and requires robust inferential chains. To support fine-grained analysis, we provide ground-truth annotations for intermediate reasoning steps. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant gaps: the best model achieves 81.5% accuracy in Classic mode, but performance drops to 17.8% in Nightmare mode. In contrast, human participants achieve 100% in both, underscoring the challenge TurnBench poses to current models. By incorporating feedback loops and hiding task rules, TurnBench reduces contamination risks and provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing multi-step, multi-turn reasoning in LLMs.

arXiv:2506.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flowcharts are a critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes. However, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships make it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models frequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when analyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated flowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and engineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which traces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response. Flowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves explainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We propose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post hoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart, then converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic approach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths. Additionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating flowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types. Experimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in LLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our proposed FlowExplainBench dataset.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for training language models (LMs) on reasoning tasks that elicit emergent long chains of thought (CoTs). Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients. To better understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into reinforcing correct responses and penalizing incorrect ones, referred to as Positive and Negative Sample Reinforcement (PSR and NSR), respectively. We train Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Qwen3-4B on a mathematical reasoning dataset and uncover a surprising result: training with only negative samples -- without reinforcing correct responses -- can be highly effective: it consistently improves performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum ($k$ up to $256$), often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO. In contrast, reinforcing only correct responses improves Pass@$1$ but degrades performance at higher $k$, due to reduced diversity. These inference-scaling trends highlight that solely penalizing incorrect responses may contribute more to performance than previously recognized. Through gradient analysis, we show that NSR works by suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs. It refines the model's existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new behaviors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple variant of the RL objective that upweights NSR, and show that it consistently improves overall Pass@$k$ performance on MATH, AIME 2025, and AMC23. Our code is available at https://github.com/TianHongZXY/RLVR-Decomposed.

Abstract: Generating psychological counseling responses with language models relies heavily on high-quality datasets. Crowdsourced data collection methods require strict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may raise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using large language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue datasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and authenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing approach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions, ensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks. Using this method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive client feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source LLMs with KokoroChat improves both the quality of generated counseling responses and the automatic evaluation of counseling dialogues. The KokoroChat dataset is available at https://github.com/UEC-InabaLab/KokoroChat.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become pervasive in our everyday life. Yet, a fundamental obstacle prevents their use in many critical applications: their propensity to generate fluent, human-quality content that is not grounded in reality. The detection of such hallucinations is thus of the highest importance. In this work, we propose a new method to flag hallucinated content, MMD-Flagger. It relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a non-parametric distance between distributions. On a high-level perspective, MMD-Flagger tracks the MMD between the generated documents and documents generated with various temperature parameters. We show empirically that inspecting the shape of this trajectory is sufficient to detect most hallucinations. This novel method is benchmarked on two machine translation datasets, on which it outperforms natural competitors.

Best-of-N reformulation over the generated candidates via prompting shows impressive potential scaling capability. However, both the previous tuning methods (training time) and adaptation approaches (test time) can not fully unleash their benefits. In this paper, we propose AdaRewriter, a novel framework for query reformulation using an outcome-supervised reward model via test-time adaptation. By training a lightweight reward model with contrastive ranking loss, AdaRewriter selects the most promising reformulation during inference. Notably, it can operate effectively in black-box systems, including commercial LLM APIs. Experiments on five conversational search datasets show that AdaRewriter significantly outperforms the existing methods across most settings, demonstrating the potential of test-time adaptation for conversational query reformulation.

Abstract: The popularity of automatic speech-to-speech translation for human conversations is growing, but the quality varies significantly depending on the language pair. In a context of community interpreting for low-resource languages, namely Turkish and Pashto to/from French, we collected fine-tuning and testing data, and compared systems using several automatic metrics (BLEU, COMET, and BLASER) and human assessments. The pipelines included automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis, with local models and cloud-based commercial ones. Some components have been fine-tuned on our data. We evaluated over 60 pipelines and determined the best one for each direction. We also found that the ranks of components are generally independent of the rest of the pipeline.

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive comparison of New York Times-style text generated by six large language models against real, human-authored NYT writing. The comparison is based on a formal syntactic theory. We use Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) to analyze the grammatical structure of the texts. We then investigate and illustrate the differences in the distributions of HPSG grammar types, revealing systematic distinctions between human and LLM-generated writing. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the syntactic behavior of LLMs as well as humans, within the NYT genre.

Abstract: We introduce UniversalCEFR, a large-scale multilingual multidimensional dataset of texts annotated according to the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference) scale in 13 languages. To enable open research in both automated readability and language proficiency assessment, UniversalCEFR comprises 505,807 CEFR-labeled texts curated from educational and learner-oriented resources, standardized into a unified data format to support consistent processing, analysis, and modeling across tasks and languages. To demonstrate its utility, we conduct benchmark experiments using three modelling paradigms: a) linguistic feature-based classification, b) fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs, and c) descriptor-based prompting of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our results further support using linguistic features and fine-tuning pretrained models in multilingual CEFR level assessment. Overall, UniversalCEFR aims to establish best practices in data distribution in language proficiency research by standardising dataset formats and promoting their accessibility to the global research community.

<title>Self-Refining Language Model Anonymizers via Adversarial Distillation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains, where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text poses emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4), raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization without relying on external costly models at inference time. We leverage adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are used to distill anonymization, adversarial inference, and utility evaluation capabilities into SLMs via supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The resulting models learn to both anonymize text and critique their outputs, enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement. Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy. These results show the effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework in training SLMs as efficient anonymizers. To facilitate further research, we release the full dataset used in our experiments.

<title>Redundancy, Isotropy, and Intrinsic Dimensionality of Prompt-based Text Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Prompt-based text embedding models, which generate task-specific embeddings upon receiving tailored prompts, have recently demonstrated remarkable performance. However, their resulting embeddings often have thousands of dimensions, leading to high storage costs and increased computational costs of embedding-based operations. In this paper, we investigate how post-hoc dimensionality reduction applied to the embeddings affects the performance of various tasks that leverage these embeddings, specifically classification, clustering, retrieval, and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. Our experiments show that even a naive dimensionality reduction, which keeps only the first 25% of the dimensions of the embeddings, results in a very slight performance degradation, indicating that these embeddings are highly redundant. Notably, for classification and clustering, even when embeddings are reduced to less than 0.5% of the original dimensionality the performance degradation is very small. To quantitatively analyze this redundancy, we perform an analysis based on the intrinsic dimensionality and isotropy of the embeddings. Our analysis reveals that embeddings for classification and clustering, which are considered to have very high dimensional redundancy, exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality and less isotropy compared with those for retrieval and STS.

Abstract: This paper reports on the development of a large-scale speech recognition model, Whale. Similar to models such as Whisper and OWSM, Whale leverages both a large model size and a diverse, extensive dataset. Whale's architecture integrates w2v-BERT self-supervised model, an encoder-decoder backbone built on E-Branchformer, and a joint CTC-attention decoding strategy. The training corpus comprises varied speech data, of not only public corpora but also in-house data, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to different speaking styles and acoustic conditions. Through evaluations on multiple benchmarks, Whale achieved comparable performance to existing models. In particular, it achieves a word error rate of 2.4% on the Librispeech test-clean set and a character error rate of 3.4% on the CSJ eval3 set, outperforming Whisper large-v3 and OWSM v3.1.

Abstract: Extracting useful signals or pattern to support important business decisions for example analyzing investment product traction and discovering customer preference, risk monitoring etc. from unstructured text is a challenging task. Capturing interaction of entities or concepts and association mining is a crucial component in text mining, enabling information extraction and reasoning over and knowledge discovery from text. Furthermore, it can be used to enrich or filter knowledge graphs to guide exploration processes, descriptive analytics and uncover hidden stories in the text. In this paper, we introduce a domain independent pipeline i.e., generalized framework to enable document filtering, entity extraction using various sources (or techniques) as plug-ins and association mining to build any text mining business use-case and quantitatively define a scoring metric for ranking purpose. The proposed framework has three major components a) Document filtering: filtering documents/text of interest from massive amount of texts b) Configurable entity extraction pipeline: include entity extraction techniques i.e., i) DBpedia Spotlight, ii) Spacy NER, iii) Custom Entity Matcher, iv) Phrase extraction (or dictionary) based c) Association Relationship Mining: To generates co-occurrence graph to analyse potential relationships among entities, concepts. Further, co-occurrence count based frequency statistics provide a holistic window to observe association trends or buzz rate in specific business context. The paper demonstrates the usage of framework as fundamental building box in two financial use-cases namely brand product discovery and vendor risk monitoring. We aim that such framework will remove duplicated effort, minimize the development effort, and encourage reusability and rapid prototyping in association mining business applications for institutions.

Abstract: This paper describes the language identification and multilingual speech recognition system developed at Tallinn University of Technology for the Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge. A hybrid language identification system is used, consisting of a pretrained language embedding model and a light-weight speech recognition model with a shared encoder across languages and language-specific bigram language models. For speech recognition, three models are used, where only a single model is applied for each language, depending on the training data availability and performance on held-out data. The model set consists of a finetuned version of SeamlessM4T, MMS-1B-all with custom language adapters and MMS-zeroshot. The system obtained the top overall score in the challenge.

<title>Integrating Neural and Symbolic Components in a Model of Pragmatic Question-Answering</title>

Abstract: Computational models of pragmatic language use have traditionally relied on hand-specified sets of utterances and meanings, limiting their applicability to real-world language use. We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances probabilistic cognitive models by integrating LLM-based modules to propose and evaluate key components in natural language, eliminating the need for manual specification. Through a classic case study of pragmatic question-answering, we systematically examine various approaches to incorporating neural modules into the cognitive model -- from evaluating utilities and literal semantics to generating alternative utterances and goals. We find that hybrid models can match or exceed the performance of traditional probabilistic models in predicting human answer patterns. However, the success of the neuro-symbolic model depends critically on how LLMs are integrated: while they are particularly effective for proposing alternatives and transforming abstract goals into utilities, they face challenges with truth-conditional semantic evaluation. This work charts a path toward more flexible and scalable models of pragmatic language use while illuminating crucial design considerations for balancing neural and symbolic components.

Abstract: Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text, has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct PARADEHATE, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech detoxification. We release PARADEHATE as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods. Experimental results show that models such as BART, fine-tuned on PARADEHATE, achieve better performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-generated detoxification text as a scalable alternative to human annotation.

<title>Argument-Centric Causal Intervention Method for Mitigating Bias in Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01488</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-document Event Coreference Resolution (CD-ECR) is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that seeks to determine whether event mentions across multiple documents refer to the same real-world occurrence. However, current CD-ECR approaches predominantly rely on trigger features within input mention pairs, which induce spurious correlations between surface-level lexical features and coreference relationships, impairing the overall performance of the models. To address this issue, we propose a novel cross-document event coreference resolution method based on Argument-Centric Causal Intervention (ACCI). Specifically, we construct a structural causal graph to uncover confounding dependencies between lexical triggers and coreference labels, and introduce backdoor-adjusted interventions to isolate the true causal effect of argument semantics. To further mitigate spurious correlations, ACCI integrates a counterfactual reasoning module that quantifies the causal influence of trigger word perturbations, and an argument-aware enhancement module to promote greater sensitivity to semantically grounded information. In contrast to prior methods that depend on costly data augmentation or heuristic-based filtering, ACCI enables effective debiasing in a unified end-to-end framework without altering the underlying training procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACCI achieves CoNLL F1 of 88.4% on ECB+ and 85.2% on GVC, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The implementation and materials are available at https://github.com/era211/ACCI.

arXiv:2506.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first multilingual study on definition modeling. We use monolingual dictionary data for four new languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, and German) and perform an in-depth empirical study to test the performance of pre-trained multilingual language models on definition modeling of monosemic words when finetuned on this data. Furthermore, we use a zero-shot approach to test the multilingual capabilities of two popular chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in the task. Results show that multilingual language models can perform on-pair with English but cannot leverage potential cross-lingual synergies, with LLMs generally offering better performance overall. A comprehensive human evaluation of the LLM-generated definition highlights the zero and few-shot capabilities of these models in this new task, also showing their shortcomings. Finally, we show that performance on our task via BERTScore strongly correlates to the performance on multilingual LLM benchmarks, suggesting that our task offers a viable compute-constrained, stable and natural alternative to these.

<title>CVC: A Large-Scale Chinese Value Rule Corpus for Value Alignment of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI. Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore, the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values. Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing Chinese characteristics. All data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Beijing-AISI/CVC, and the code is available at https://github.com/Beijing-AISI/CVC.

Abstract: Rapid growth in speech data demands adaptive models, as traditional static methods fail to keep pace with dynamic and diverse speech information. We introduce continuous speech learning, a new set-up targeting at bridging the adaptation gap in current speech models. We use the encoder-decoder Whisper model to standardize speech tasks into a generative format. We integrate a learnable gated-fusion layer on the top of the encoder to dynamically select task-specific features for downstream tasks. Our approach improves accuracy significantly over traditional methods in six speech processing tasks, demonstrating gains in adapting to new speech tasks without full retraining.

Abstract: Rational speakers are supposed to know what they know and what they do not know, and to generate expressions matching the strength of evidence. In contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of epistemic modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable. To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge of epistemic modality in LLMs.

Abstract: Online form filling is a common yet labor-intensive task involving extensive keyboard and mouse interactions. Despite the long-standing vision of automating this process with "one click", existing tools remain largely rule-based and lack generalizable, generative capabilities. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled promising agents for GUI-related tasks in general-purpose scenarios. However, they struggle with the unique challenges of form filling, such as flexible layouts and the difficulty of aligning textual instructions with on-screen fields. To bridge this gap, we formally define the form-filling task and propose FormFactory, an interactive benchmarking suite comprising a web-based interface, backend evaluation module, and carefully constructed dataset. Our benchmark covers diverse real-world scenarios, incorporates various field formats, and simulates high-fidelity form interactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe that no model surpasses 5% accuracy, underscoring the inherent difficulty of the task. These findings also reveal significant limitations in current models' visual layout reasoning and field-value alignment abilities. We hope our benchmark can serve as a stepping stone for further research into robust, practical form-filling agents.

Abstract: With the continued proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) based chatbots, there is a growing demand for generating responses that are not only linguistically fluent but also consistently aligned with persona-specific traits in conversations. However, existing role-play and persona-based chat approaches rely heavily on static role descriptions, coarse-grained signal space, and low-quality synthetic data, which fail to capture dynamic fine-grained details in human-like chat. Human-like chat requires modeling subtle latent traits, such as emotional tone, situational awareness, and evolving personality, which are difficult to predefine and cannot be easily learned from synthetic or distillation-based data. To address these limitations, we propose a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework, containing a variational auto-encoding module and fine-grained control space which dynamically adapts dialogue behaviour based on fine-grained, interpretable latent variables across talking style, interaction patterns, and personal attributes. We also construct a high-quality dataset, HumanChatData, and benchmark HumanChatBench to address the scarcity of high-quality data in the human-like domain. Experiments show that LLMs based on V-VAE consistently outperform standard baselines on HumanChatBench and DialogBench, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of V-VAE and HumanChatData.

Abstract: High-quality math datasets are crucial for advancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing datasets often suffer from three key issues: outdated and insufficient challenging content, neglecting human-like reasoning, and limited reliability due to single-LLM generation. To address these, we introduce $\textbf{STORM-BORN}$, an ultra-challenging dataset of mathematical derivations sourced from cutting-edge academic papers, which includes dense human-like approximations and heuristic cues. To ensure the reliability and quality, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop, multi-agent data generation framework, integrating reasoning-dense filters, multi-agent collaboration, and human mathematicians' evaluations. We curated a set of 2,000 synthetic samples and deliberately selected the 100 most difficult problems. Even most advanced models like GPT-o1 solved fewer than $5\%$ of them. Fine-tuning on STORM-BORN boosts accuracy by $7.84\%$ (LLaMA3-8B) and $9.12\%$ (Qwen2.5-7B). As AI approaches mathematician-level reasoning, STORM-BORN provides both a high-difficulty benchmark and a human-like reasoning training resource. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/lwhere/STORM-BORN.

Abstract: Cross-lingual vocabulary transfer plays a promising role in adapting pre-trained language models to new languages, including low-resource languages. Existing approaches that utilize monolingual or parallel corpora face challenges when applied to languages with limited resources. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective vocabulary transfer method that utilizes bilingual dictionaries, which are available for many languages, thanks to descriptive linguists. Our proposed method leverages a property of BPE tokenizers where removing a subword from the vocabulary causes a fallback to shorter subwords. The embeddings of target subwords are estimated iteratively by progressively removing them from the tokenizer. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods for low-resource languages, demonstrating the effectiveness of a dictionary-based approach for cross-lingual vocabulary transfer.

Abstract: Culture is a rich and dynamic domain that evolves across both geography and time. However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation.The former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural understanding but fall short by 10\% to human experts, while open VLMs lags further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of only 42\%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and creative adaptation.

Abstract: Large language model performance can be improved in a large number of ways. Many such techniques, like fine-tuning or advanced tool usage, are time-intensive and expensive. Although prompt engineering is significantly cheaper and often works for simpler tasks, it remains unclear whether prompt engineering suffices for more complex domains like forecasting. Here we show that small prompt modifications rarely boost forecasting accuracy beyond a minimal baseline. In our first study, we tested 38 prompts across Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.1 405B. In our second, we introduced compound prompts and prompts from external sources, also including the reasoning models o1 and o1-mini. Our results show that most prompts lead to negligible gains, although references to base rates yield slight benefits. Surprisingly, some strategies showed strong negative effects on accuracy: especially encouraging the model to engage in Bayesian reasoning. These results suggest that, in the context of complex tasks like forecasting, basic prompt refinements alone offer limited gains, implying that more robust or specialized techniques may be required for substantial performance improvements in AI forecasting.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu. Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of news.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot and few-shot tasks, but achieving similar performance with encoder-only models like BERT and RoBERTa has been challenging due to their architecture. However, encoders offer advantages such as lower computational and memory costs. Recent work adapts them for zero-shot generalization using Statement Tuning, which reformulates tasks into finite templates. We extend this approach to multilingual NLP, exploring whether encoders can achieve zero-shot cross-lingual generalization and serve as efficient alternatives to memory-intensive LLMs for low-resource languages. Our results show that state-of-the-art encoder models generalize well across languages, rivaling multilingual LLMs while being more efficient. We also analyze multilingual Statement Tuning dataset design, efficiency gains, and language-specific generalization, contributing to more inclusive and resource-efficient NLP models. We release our code and models.

Abstract: Word sense analysis is an essential analysis work for interpreting the linguistic and social backgrounds. The word sense change detection is a task of identifying and interpreting shifts in word meanings over time. This paper proposes MMD-Sense-Analysis, a novel approach that leverages Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to select semantically meaningful variables and quantify changes across time periods. This method enables both the identification of words undergoing sense shifts and the explanation of their evolution over multiple historical periods. To my knowledge, this is the first application of MMD to word sense change detection. Empirical assessment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable language models to access relevant information and generate accurate, well-grounded, and contextually informed responses. However, for Indian languages, the development of high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1) evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world information-seeking tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models such as BERT have been proved to be powerful in many natural language processing tasks. But in some text classification applications such as emotion recognition and sentiment analysis, BERT may not lead to satisfactory performance. This often happens in applications where keywords play critical roles in the prediction of class labels. Our investigation found that the root cause of the problem is that the context-based BERT embedding of the keywords may not be discriminative enough to produce discriminative text representation for classification. Motivated by this finding, we develop a method to enhance word embeddings using domain-specific lexical knowledge. The knowledge-based embedding enhancement model projects the BERT embedding into a new space where within-class similarity and between-class difference are maximized. To implement the knowledge-based word embedding enhancement model, we also develop a knowledge acquisition algorithm for automatically collecting lexical knowledge from online open sources. Experiment results on three classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition and question answering, have shown the effectiveness of our proposed word embedding enhancing model. The codes and datasets are in https://github.com/MidiyaZhu/KVWEFFER.

Abstract: Fake news on social media is a widespread and serious problem in today's society. Existing fake news detection methods focus on finding clues from Long text content, such as original news articles and user comments. This paper solves the problem of fake news detection in more realistic scenarios. Only source shot-text tweet and its retweet users are provided without user comments. We develop a novel neural network based model, \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{N}etworks (MVAN) to detect fake news and provide explanations on social media. The MVAN model includes text semantic attention and propagation structure attention, which ensures that our model can capture information and clues both of source tweet content and propagation structure. In addition, the two attention mechanisms in the model can find key clue words in fake news texts and suspicious users in the propagation structure. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that MVAN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by 2.5\% in accuracy on average, and produce a reasonable explanation.

Abstract: Multilingual language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to transfer knowledge across languages, despite being trained without explicit cross-lingual supervision. We analyze the parameter spaces of three MLLMs to study how their representations evolve during pre-training, observing patterns consistent with compression: models initially form language-specific representations, which gradually converge into cross-lingual abstractions as training progresses. Through probing experiments, we observe a clear transition from uniform language identification capabilities across layers to more specialized layer functions. For deeper analysis, we focus on neurons that encode distinct semantic concepts. By tracing their development during pre-training, we show how they gradually align across languages. Notably, we identify specific neurons that emerge as increasingly reliable predictors for the same concepts across languages.

<title>ESGenius: Benchmarking LLMs on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Sustainability Knowledge</title>

Abstract: We introduce ESGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and enhancing the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainability-focused question answering. ESGenius comprises two key components: (i) ESGenius-QA, a collection of 1 136 multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs and rigorously validated by domain experts, covering a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainability topics. Each question is systematically linked to its corresponding source text, enabling transparent evaluation and supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus, a meticulously curated repository of 231 foundational frameworks, standards, reports and recommendation documents from seven authoritative sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capabilities and adaptation potential of the model, we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation protocol -- Zero-Shot and RAG. Extensive experiments across 50 LLMs (ranging from 0.5 B to 671 B parameters) demonstrate that state-of-the-art models achieve only moderate performance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies typically around 55--70\%, highlighting ESGenius's challenging nature for LLMs in interdisciplinary contexts. However, models employing RAG show significant performance improvements, particularly for smaller models. For example, "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B" improves from 63.82\% (zero-shot) to 80.46\% with RAG. These results underscore the necessity of grounding responses in authoritative sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To the best of our knowledge, ESGenius is the first benchmark curated for LLMs and the relevant enhancement technologies that focuses on ESG and sustainability topics.

Abstract: Despite substantial research efforts evaluating how well large language models~(LLMs) handle global cultural diversity, the mechanisms behind their cultural knowledge acquisition, particularly in multilingual settings, remain unclear. We study this question by investigating how cultural knowledge transfers across languages during language adaptation of LLMs. We introduce an interpretable framework for studying this transfer, ensuring training data transparency and controlling transfer effects. Through a study of four non-Anglophonic cultures, we observe bidirectional cultural transfer between English and other high-resource languages, while low-resource languages primarily transfer knowledge to English with limited reverse flow. To explain this asymmetric phenomenon, we propose a frequency-based hypothesis: cultural knowledge appearing more frequently in the pretraining data transfers more easily, which is supported by empirical analysis of the training corpora.

Abstract: Subword-level understanding is integral to numerous tasks, including understanding multi-digit numbers, spelling mistakes, abbreviations, rhyming, and wordplay. Despite this, current large language models (LLMs) still often struggle with seemingly simple subword-level tasks like How many 'r's in 'strawberry'?. A key factor behind these failures is tokenization which obscures the fine-grained structure of words. Current alternatives, such as character-level and dropout tokenization methods, significantly increase computational costs and provide inconsistent improvements. In this paper we revisit tokenization and introduce StochasTok, a simple, efficient stochastic tokenization scheme that randomly splits tokens during training, allowing LLMs to 'see' their internal structure. Our experiments show that pretraining with StochasTok substantially improves LLMs' downstream performance across multiple subword-level language games, including character counting, substring identification, and math tasks. Furthermore, StochasTok's simplicity allows seamless integration at any stage of the training pipeline; and we demonstrate that post-training with StochasTok can instill improved subword understanding into existing pretrained models, thus avoiding costly pretraining from scratch. These dramatic improvements achieved with a minimal change suggest StochasTok holds exciting potential when applied to larger, more capable models.

<title>When LLMs Team Up: The Emergence of Collaborative Affective Computing</title>

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) is essential in bridging the gap between human emotional experiences and machine understanding. Traditionally, AC tasks in natural language processing (NLP) have been approached through pipeline architectures, which often suffer from structure rigidity that leads to inefficiencies and limited adaptability. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized this field by offering a unified approach to affective understanding and generation tasks, enhancing the potential for dynamic, real-time interactions. However, LLMs face cognitive limitations in affective reasoning, such as misinterpreting cultural nuances or contextual emotions, and hallucination problems in decision-making. To address these challenges, recent research advocates for LLM-based collaboration systems that emphasize interactions among specialized models and LLMs, mimicking human-like affective intelligence through the synergy of emotional and rational thinking that aligns with Dual Process Theory in psychology. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM-based collaboration systems in AC, exploring from structured collaborations to autonomous collaborations. Specifically, it includes: (1) A systematic review of existing methods, focusing on collaboration strategies, mechanisms, key functions, and applications; (2) Experimental comparisons of collaboration strategies across representative tasks in affective understanding and generation; (3) An analysis highlighting the potential of these systems to enhance robustness and adaptability in complex affective reasoning; (4) A discussion of key challenges and future research directions to further advance the field. This work is the first to systematically explore collaborative intelligence with LLMs in AC, paving the way for more powerful applications that approach human-like social intelligence.

Abstract: The large language models (LLMs) are able to generate high-quality texts in multiple languages. Such texts are often not recognizable by humans as generated, and therefore present a potential of LLMs for misuse (e.g., plagiarism, spams, disinformation spreading). An automated detection is able to assist humans to indicate the machine-generated texts; however, its robustness to out-of-distribution data is still challenging. This notebook describes our mdok approach in robust detection, based on fine-tuning smaller LLMs for text classification. It is applied to both subtasks of Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025, providing remarkable performance in binary detection as well as in multiclass (1st rank) classification of various cases of human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: We investigate fairness dynamics during Large Language Model (LLM) training to enable the diagnoses of biases and mitigations through training interventions like early stopping; we find that biases can emerge suddenly and do not always follow common performance metrics. We introduce two new metrics to evaluate fairness dynamics holistically during model pre-training: Average Rank and Jensen-Shannon Divergence by Parts. These metrics provide insights into the Pythia models' progression of biases in gender prediction of occupations on the WinoBias dataset. By monitoring these dynamics, we find that (1) Pythia-6.9b is biased towards men; it becomes more performant and confident predicting "male" than "female" during training, (2) via early-stopping, Pythia-6.9b can exchange 1.7% accuracy on LAMBADA for a 92.5% increase in fairness, and (3) larger models can exhibit more bias; Pythia-6.9b makes more assumptions about gender than Pythia-160m, even when a subject's gender is not specified.

Abstract: Table reasoning, encompassing tasks such as table question answering, fact verification, and text-to-SQL, requires precise understanding of structured tabular data, coupled with numerical computation and code manipulation for effective inference. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have achieved notable success but often struggle with generalization and robustness due to biases inherent in imitative learning. We introduce Reasoning-Table, the first application of reinforcement learning (RL) to table reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Through rigorous data preprocessing, reward design, and tailored training strategies, our method leverages simple rule-based outcome rewards to outperform SFT across multiple benchmarks. Unified training across diverse tasks enables Reasoning-Table to emerge as a robust table reasoning large language model, surpassing larger proprietary models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet by 4.0% on table reasoning benchmarks. The approach also achieves excellent performance on text-to-SQL tasks, reaching 68.3% performance on the BIRD dev dataset with a 7B model. Further experiments demonstrate that Reasoning-Table enhances the model's generalization capabilities and robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality.

Abstract: Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their non-compositional figurative meanings, which often strongly diverge from the idiom's literal interpretation. This duality requires a model to learn representing and deciding between the two meanings to interpret an idiom in a figurative sense, or literally. In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer (LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom processing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early attention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost the figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal interpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation through an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards literal interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in an autoregressive transformer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large amounts of data from different sources and domains. These data most often contain trillions of tokens with large portions of copyrighted or proprietary content, which hinders the usage of such models under AI legislation. This raises the need for truly open pre-training data that is compliant with the data security regulations. In this paper, we introduce Common Corpus, the largest open dataset for language model pre-training. The data assembled in Common Corpus are either uncopyrighted or under permissible licenses and amount to about two trillion tokens. The dataset contains a wide variety of languages, ranging from the main European languages to low-resource ones rarely present in pre-training datasets; in addition, it includes a large portion of code data. The diversity of data sources in terms of covered domains and time periods opens up the paths for both research and entrepreneurial needs in diverse areas of knowledge. In this technical report, we present the detailed provenance of data assembling and the details of dataset filtering and curation. Being already used by such industry leaders as Anthropic and multiple LLM training projects, we believe that Common Corpus will become a critical infrastructure for open science research in LLMs.

<title>Benford's Curse: Tracing Digit Bias to Numerical Hallucination in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet they frequently fail on basic numerical problems, producing incorrect outputs. Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model behavior. Our findings reveal a fundamental connection between corpus-level statistics and symbolic failure modes in LLMs, offering a new lens for diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in numerical tasks.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant interest in Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) for applications such as emotional companionship and virtual interaction. However, recent RPAs are often built on explicit dialogue data, lacking deep, human-like internal thought processes, resulting in superficial knowledge and style expression. While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct application is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role) and style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than character-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two important stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style Optimization (RSO). RIA explicitly guides the model with character profiles during reasoning to counteract attention diversion, and then RSO aligns reasoning style with the character and scene via LRM distillation to mitigate style drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAR significantly enhances the performance of RPAs by effectively addressing attention diversion and style drift.

Abstract: Kwak'wala is an Indigenous language spoken in British Columbia, with a rich legacy of published documentation spanning more than a century, and an active community of speakers, teachers, and learners engaged in language revitalization. Over 11 volumes of the earliest texts created during the collaboration between Franz Boas and George Hunt have been scanned but remain unreadable by machines. Complete digitization through optical character recognition has the potential to facilitate transliteration into modern orthographies and the creation of other language technologies. In this paper, we apply the latest OCR techniques to a series of Kwak'wala texts only accessible as images, and discuss the challenges and unique adaptations necessary to make such technologies work for these real-world texts. Building on previous methods, we propose using a mix of off-the-shelf OCR methods, language identification, and masking to effectively isolate Kwak'wala text, along with post-correction models, to produce a final high-quality transcription.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, the ability to follow instructions has emerged as a key metric for evaluating their practical utility. However, existing evaluation methods often focus on single-language scenarios, overlooking the challenges and differences present in multilingual and cross-lingual contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MaXIFE: a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess instruction-following capabilities across 23 languages with 1,667 verifiable instruction tasks. MaXIFE integrates both Rule-Based Evaluation and Model-Based Evaluation, ensuring a balance of efficiency and accuracy. We applied MaXIFE to evaluate several leading commercial and open-source LLMs, establishing baseline results for future comparisons. By providing a standardized tool for multilingual instruction-following evaluation, MaXIFE aims to advance research and development in natural language processing.

<title>iQUEST: An Iterative Question-Guided Framework for Knowledge Base Question Answering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01784</link>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.

Abstract: Currently, nearly all evaluations of foundation models focus on objective metrics, emphasizing quiz performance to define model capabilities. While this model-centric approach enables rapid performance assessment, it fails to reflect authentic human experiences. To address this gap, we propose a Human-Centric subjective Evaluation (HCE) framework, focusing on three core dimensions: problem-solving ability, information quality, and interaction experience. Through experiments involving Deepseek R1, OpenAI o3 mini, Grok 3, and Gemini 2.5, we conduct over 540 participant-driven evaluations, where humans and models collaborate on open-ended research tasks, yielding a comprehensive subjective dataset. This dataset captures diverse user feedback across multiple disciplines, revealing distinct model strengths and adaptability. Our findings highlight Grok 3's superior performance, followed by Deepseek R1 and Gemini 2.5, with OpenAI o3 mini lagging behind. By offering a novel framework and a rich dataset, this study not only enhances subjective evaluation methodologies but also lays the foundation for standardized, automated assessments, advancing LLM development for research and practical scenarios.

<title>Read it in Two Steps: Translating Extremely Low-Resource Languages with Code-Augmented Grammar Books</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01796</link>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in translating extremely low-resource languages using resources like dictionaries, the effectiveness of grammar books remains debated. This paper investigates the role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation. Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting in a 13.1% BLEU improvement in translation.

Abstract: The conflict in Ukraine has been not only characterised by military engagement but also by a significant information war, with social media platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter playing an important role in shaping public perception. This article provides an analysis of tweets from propaganda accounts and trusted accounts collected from the onset of the war, February 2022 until the middle of May 2022 with n=40,000 total tweets. We utilise natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to assess the sentiment and identify key themes, topics and narratives across the dataset with human-in-the-loop (HITL) analysis throughout. Our findings indicate distinct strategies in how information is created, spread, and targeted at different audiences by both sides. Propaganda accounts frequently employ emotionally charged language and disinformation to evoke fear and distrust, whereas other accounts, primarily Western tend to focus on factual reporting and humanitarian aspects of the conflict. Clustering analysis reveals groups of accounts with similar behaviours, which we suspect indicates the presence of coordinated efforts. This research attempts to contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of information warfare and offers techniques for future studies on social media influence in military conflicts.

Abstract: In this paper we describe NAVER LABS Europe submission to the instruction-following speech processing short track at IWSLT 2025. We participate in the constrained settings, developing systems that can simultaneously perform ASR, ST, and SQA tasks from English speech input into the following target languages: Chinese, Italian, and German. Our solution leverages two pretrained modules: (1) a speech-to-LLM embedding projector trained using representations from the SeamlessM4T-v2-large speech encoder; and (2) LoRA adapters trained on text data on top of a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. These modules are jointly loaded and further instruction-tuned for 1K steps on multilingual and multimodal data to form our final system submitted for evaluation.

<title>Analysis of LLM Bias (Chinese Propaganda &amp; Anti-US Sentiment) in DeepSeek-R1 vs. ChatGPT o3-mini-high</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape public understanding and civic decisions, yet their ideological neutrality is a growing concern. While existing research has explored various forms of LLM bias, a direct, cross-lingual comparison of models with differing geopolitical alignments-specifically a PRC-system model versus a non-PRC counterpart-has been lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating DeepSeek-R1 (PRC-aligned) against ChatGPT o3-mini-high (non-PRC) for Chinese-state propaganda and anti-U.S. sentiment. We developed a novel corpus of 1,200 de-contextualized, reasoning-oriented questions derived from Chinese-language news, presented in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. Answers from both models (7,200 total) were assessed using a hybrid evaluation pipeline combining rubric-guided GPT-4o scoring with human annotation. Our findings reveal significant model-level and language-dependent biases. DeepSeek-R1 consistently exhibited substantially higher proportions of both propaganda and anti-U.S. bias compared to ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which remained largely free of anti-U.S. sentiment and showed lower propaganda levels. For DeepSeek-R1, Simplified Chinese queries elicited the highest bias rates; these diminished in Traditional Chinese and were nearly absent in English. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 occasionally responded in Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese queries and amplified existing PRC-aligned terms in its Chinese answers, demonstrating an "invisible loudspeaker" effect. Furthermore, such biases were not confined to overtly political topics but also permeated cultural and lifestyle content, particularly in DeepSeek-R1.

<title>BD at BEA 2025 Shared Task: MPNet Ensembles for Pedagogical Mistake Identification and Localization in AI Tutor Responses</title>

Abstract: We present Team BD's submission to the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors, under Track 1 (Mistake Identification) and Track 2 (Mistake Location). Both tracks involve three-class classification of tutor responses in educational dialogues - determining if a tutor correctly recognizes a student's mistake (Track 1) and whether the tutor pinpoints the mistake's location (Track 2). Our system is built on MPNet, a Transformer-based language model that combines BERT and XLNet's pre-training advantages. We fine-tuned MPNet on the task data using a class-weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalance, and leveraged grouped cross-validation (10 folds) to maximize the use of limited data while avoiding dialogue overlap between training and validation. We then performed a hard-voting ensemble of the best models from each fold, which improves robustness and generalization by combining multiple classifiers. Our approach achieved strong results on both tracks, with exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for Mistake Identification and 0.5543 for Mistake Location on the official test set. We include comprehensive analysis of our system's performance, including confusion matrices and t-SNE visualizations to interpret classifier behavior, as well as a taxonomy of common errors with examples. We hope our ensemble-based approach and findings provide useful insights for designing reliable tutor response evaluation systems in educational dialogue settings.

Abstract: With the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), the automation of daily tasks, like automatic writing, is getting more and more attention. Hence, efforts have focused on aligning LLMs with human values, yet humor, particularly professional industrial humor used in workplaces, has been largely neglected. To address this, we develop a dataset of professional humor statements along with features that determine the appropriateness of each statement. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows that LLMs often struggle to judge the appropriateness of humor accurately.

Abstract: Citation quality is crucial in information-seeking systems, directly influencing trust and the effectiveness of information access. Current evaluation frameworks, both human and automatic, mainly rely on Natural Language Inference (NLI) to assess binary or ternary supportiveness from cited sources, which we argue is a suboptimal proxy for citation evaluation. In this work we introduce CiteEval, a citation evaluation framework driven by principles focusing on fine-grained citation assessment within a broad context, encompassing not only the cited sources but the full retrieval context, user query, and generated text. Guided by the proposed framework, we construct CiteBench, a multi-domain benchmark with high-quality human annotations on citation quality. To enable efficient evaluation, we further develop CiteEval-Auto, a suite of model-based metrics that exhibit strong correlation with human judgments. Experiments across diverse systems demonstrate CiteEval-Auto's superior ability to capture the multifaceted nature of citations compared to existing metrics, offering a principled and scalable approach to evaluate and improve model-generated citations.

Abstract: There is a lack of an evaluation methodology that estimates the extent to which large language models (LLMs) use code-switching (CS) in the same way as bilinguals. Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words.

<title>Code-Switching and Syntax: A Large-Scale Experiment</title>

Abstract: The theoretical code-switching (CS) literature provides numerous pointwise investigations that aim to explain patterns in CS, i.e. why bilinguals switch language in certain positions in a sentence more often than in others. A resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language, cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns generalise well to unseen language pairs.

Abstract: We introduce Conversational Function-Calling Evaluation Through Turn-Level Interactions (CONFETTI), a conversational benchmark1 designed to evaluate the function-calling capabilities and response quality of large language models (LLMs). Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109 human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs. These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs, conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than 20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top performing models on CONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5 (35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and Mistral-Large-2407 (30.07%).

<title>Is Extending Modality The Right Path Towards Omni-Modality?</title>

Abstract: Omni-modal language models (OLMs) aim to integrate and reason over diverse input modalities--such as text, images, video, and audio--while maintaining strong language capabilities. Despite recent advancements, existing models, especially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to generalize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve strong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of extending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models, where an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and language data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does modality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging effectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to achieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better knowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through extensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into the feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches.

Abstract: Image mass cytometry (IMC) enables high-dimensional spatial profiling by combining mass cytometry's analytical power with spatial distributions of cell phenotypes. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context. However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach. Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices, pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability. The source code can be found here: https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/Spatial2Sentence.

Abstract: This paper addresses critical gaps in Arabic language model evaluation by establishing comprehensive theoretical guidelines and introducing a novel evaluation framework. We first analyze existing Arabic evaluation datasets, identifying significant issues in linguistic accuracy, cultural alignment, and methodological rigor. To address these limitations in LLMs, we present the Arabic Depth Mini Dataset (ADMD), a carefully curated collection of 490 challenging questions spanning ten major domains (42 sub-domains, see Figure 1. Using ADMD, we evaluate five leading language models: GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Flash 1.5, CommandR 100B, and Qwen-Max. Our results reveal significant variations in model performance across different domains, with particular challenges in areas requiring deep cultural understanding and specialized knowledge. Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated the highest overall accuracy at 30\%, showing relative strength in mathematical theory in Arabic, Arabic language, and islamic domains. This work provides both theoretical foundations and practical insights for improving Arabic language model evaluation, emphasizing the importance of cultural competence alongside technical capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation. Among this family of models, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) achieve the strongest performance but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack key inference-time efficiency features--most notably, KV caching. In this work, we introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms, enabling smooth interpolation between their perplexities while overcoming their respective limitations. Eso-LMs set a new state of the art on standard language modeling benchmarks. Crucially, we are the **first to introduce KV caching for MDMs** while preserving parallel generation, significantly improving inference efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, our method achieves up to **65x** faster inference than standard MDMs and **4x** faster inference than prior semi-autoregressive approaches. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page: [http://s-sahoo.github.io/Eso-LMs](http://s-sahoo.github.io/Eso-LMs)

Abstract: Reward models are used throughout the post-training of language models to capture nuanced signals from preference data and provide a training target for optimization across instruction following, reasoning, safety, and more domains. The community has begun establishing best practices for evaluating reward models, from the development of benchmarks that test capabilities in specific skill areas to others that test agreement with human preferences. At the same time, progress in evaluation has not been mirrored by the effectiveness of reward models in downstream tasks -- simpler direct alignment algorithms are reported to work better in many cases. This paper introduces RewardBench 2, a new multi-skill reward modeling benchmark designed to bring new, challenging data for accuracy-based reward model evaluation -- models score about 20 points on average lower on RewardBench 2 compared to the first RewardBench -- while being highly correlated with downstream performance. Compared to most other benchmarks, RewardBench 2 sources new human prompts instead of existing prompts from downstream evaluations, facilitating more rigorous evaluation practices. In this paper, we describe our benchmark construction process and report how existing models perform on it, while quantifying how performance on the benchmark correlates with downstream use of the models in both inference-time scaling algorithms, like best-of-N sampling, and RLHF training algorithms like proximal policy optimization.

Abstract: Effective wastewater and stormwater management is essential for urban sustainability and environmental protection. Extracting structured knowledge from reports and regulations is challenging due to domainspecific terminology and multilingual contexts. This work focuses on domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) as a first step towards effective relation and information extraction to support decision making. A multilingual benchmark is crucial for evaluating these methods. This study develops a French-Italian domain-specific text corpus for wastewater management. It evaluates state-of-the-art NER methods, including LLM-based approaches, to provide a reliable baseline for future strategies and explores automated annotation projection in view of an extension of the corpus to new languages.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.

<title>Self-ensemble: Mitigating Confidence Distortion for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general fields, they exhibit a confidence distortion problem on multi-choice question-answering (MCQA), particularly as the number of answer choices increases. Specifically, on MCQA with many choices, LLMs suffer from under-confidence in correct predictions and over-confidence in incorrect ones, leading to a substantially degraded performance. To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs, outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.

Abstract: Powered by a large language model (LLM), a web browsing agent operates web browsers in a human-like manner and offers a highly transparent path toward automating a wide range of everyday tasks. As web agents become increasingly capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks. WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro, there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena, highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.

<title>DRAG: Distilling RAG for SLMs from LLMs to Transfer Knowledge and Mitigate Hallucination via Evidence and Graph-based Distillation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have proven highly effective for tasks requiring factual consistency and robust knowledge retrieval. However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$ effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.

<title>GLEN: Generative Retrieval via Lexical Index Learning</title>

Abstract: Generative retrieval shed light on a new paradigm of document retrieval, aiming to directly generate the identifier of a relevant document for a query. While it takes advantage of bypassing the construction of auxiliary index structures, existing studies face two significant challenges: (i) the discrepancy between the knowledge of pre-trained language models and identifiers and (ii) the gap between training and inference that poses difficulty in learning to rank. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel generative retrieval method, namely Generative retrieval via LExical iNdex learning (GLEN). For training, GLEN effectively exploits a dynamic lexical identifier using a two-phase index learning strategy, enabling it to learn meaningful lexical identifiers and relevance signals between queries and documents. For inference, GLEN utilizes collision-free inference, using identifier weights to rank documents without additional overhead. Experimental results prove that GLEN achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance against existing generative retrieval methods on various benchmark datasets, e.g., NQ320k, MS MARCO, and BEIR. The code is available at https://github.com/skleee/GLEN.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their remarkable compatibility with Hardware Description Language (HDL) design. In this paper, we examine the performance of three major LLMs, Claude 3 Opus, ChatGPT-4, and ChatGPT-4o, in designing finite state machines (FSMs). By utilizing the instructional content provided by HDLBits, we evaluate the stability, limitations, and potential approaches for improving the success rates of these models. Furthermore, we explore the impact of using the prompt-refining method, To-do-Oriented Prompting (TOP) Patch, on the success rate of these LLM models in various FSM design scenarios. The results show that the systematic format prompt method and the novel prompt refinement method have the potential to be applied to other domains beyond HDL design automation, considering its possible integration with other prompt engineering techniques in the future.

Abstract: How does textual representation of audio relate to the Large Language Model's (LLMs) learning about the audio world? This research investigates the extent to which LLMs can be prompted to generate audio, despite their primary training in textual data. We employ a three-tier approach, progressively increasing the complexity of audio generation: 1) Musical Notes, 2) Environmental Sounds, and 3) Human Speech. To bridge the gap between text and audio, we leverage code as an intermediary, prompting LLMs to generate code that, when executed, produces the desired audio output. To evaluate the quality and accuracy of the generated audio, we employ FAD and CLAP scores. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate basic audio features, their performance deteriorates as the complexity of the audio increases. This suggests that while LLMs possess a latent understanding of the auditory world, their ability to translate this understanding into tangible audio output remains rudimentary. Further research into techniques that can enhance the quality and diversity of LLM-generated audio can lead to an improvement in the performance of text-based LLMs in generating audio.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance large language models (LLMs) by conditioning generation on external evidence retrieved at inference time. While RAG addresses critical limitations of parametric knowledge storage-such as factual inconsistency and domain inflexibility-it introduces new challenges in retrieval quality, grounding fidelity, pipeline efficiency, and robustness against noisy or adversarial inputs. This survey provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent advances in RAG systems, offering a taxonomy that categorizes architectures into retriever-centric, generator-centric, hybrid, and robustness-oriented designs. We systematically analyze enhancements across retrieval optimization, context filtering, decoding control, and efficiency improvements, supported by comparative performance analyses on short-form and multi-hop question answering tasks. Furthermore, we review state-of-the-art evaluation frameworks and benchmarks, highlighting trends in retrieval-aware evaluation, robustness testing, and federated retrieval settings. Our analysis reveals recurring trade-offs between retrieval precision and generation flexibility, efficiency and faithfulness, and modularity and coordination. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future research directions, including adaptive retrieval architectures, real-time retrieval integration, structured reasoning over multi-hop evidence, and privacy-preserving retrieval mechanisms. This survey aims to consolidate current knowledge in RAG research and serve as a foundation for the next generation of retrieval-augmented language modeling systems.

Abstract: Purpose: We investigated the utilization of privacy-preserving, locally-deployed, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract diagnostic information from free-text cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) reports. Materials and Methods: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs on their ability to identify diagnoses and classify patients into various cardiac diagnostic categories based on descriptive findings in 109 clinical CMR reports. Performance was quantified using standard classification metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also employed confusion matrices to examine patterns of misclassification across models. Results: Most open-source LLMs demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying reports into different diagnostic categories. Google's Gemma2 model achieved the highest average F1 score of 0.98, followed by Qwen2.5:32B and DeepseekR1-32B with F1 scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. All other evaluated models attained average scores above 0.93, with Mistral and DeepseekR1-7B being the only exceptions. The top four LLMs outperformed our board-certified cardiologist (F1 score of 0.94) across all evaluation metrics in analyzing CMR reports. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of implementing open-source, privacy-preserving LLMs in clinical settings for automated analysis of imaging reports, enabling accurate, fast and resource-efficient diagnostic categorization.

<title>SafeCOMM: What about Safety Alignment in Fine-Tuned Telecom Large Language Models?</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for telecom tasks and datasets is a common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However, little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety. Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue for telecom-tuned LLMs using three representative datasets featured by the GenAINet initiative. We show that safety degradation persists even for structured and seemingly harmless datasets such as 3GPP standards and tabular records, indicating that telecom-specific data is not immune to safety erosion during fine-tuning. We further extend our analysis to publicly available Telecom LLMs trained via continual pre-training, revealing that safety alignment is often severely lacking, primarily due to the omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues in both fine-tuned and pre-trained models, we conduct extensive experiments and evaluate three safety realignment defenses (SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, and SafeMERGE) using established red-teaming benchmarks. The results show that, across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety after harmful degradation without compromising downstream task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. In a nutshell, our work serves as a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, and emphasizes the importance of safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning for real-world deployments of Telecom LLMs.

Abstract: This paper investigates how prompt engineering techniques impact both accuracy and confidence elicitation in Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to medical contexts. Using a stratified dataset of Persian board exam questions across multiple specialties, we evaluated five LLMs - GPT-4o, o3-mini, Llama-3.3-70b, Llama-3.1-8b, and DeepSeek-v3 - across 156 configurations. These configurations varied in temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), prompt styles (Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Emotional, Expert Mimicry), and confidence scales (1-10, 1-100). We used AUC-ROC, Brier Score, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to evaluate alignment between confidence and actual performance. Chain-of-Thought prompts improved accuracy but also led to overconfidence, highlighting the need for calibration. Emotional prompting further inflated confidence, risking poor decisions. Smaller models like Llama-3.1-8b underperformed across all metrics, while proprietary models showed higher accuracy but still lacked calibrated confidence. These results suggest prompt engineering must address both accuracy and uncertainty to be effective in high-stakes medical tasks.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.

Abstract: Television networks face high financial risk when making programming decisions, often relying on limited historical data to forecast episodic viewership. This study introduces a machine learning framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) features from over 25000 television episodes with traditional viewership data to enhance predictive accuracy. By extracting emotional tone, cognitive complexity, and narrative structure from episode dialogue, we evaluate forecasting performance using SARIMAX, rolling XGBoost, and feature selection models. While prior viewership remains a strong baseline predictor, NLP features contribute meaningful improvements for some series. We also introduce a similarity scoring method based on Euclidean distance between aggregate dialogue vectors to compare shows by content. Tested across diverse genres, including Better Call Saul and Abbott Elementary, our framework reveals genre-specific performance and offers interpretable metrics for writers, executives, and marketers seeking data-driven insight into audience behavior.

Abstract: With the growing importance of AI governance, numerous high-level frameworks and principles have been articulated by policymakers, institutions, and expert communities to guide the development and application of AI. While such frameworks offer valuable normative orientation, they may not fully capture the practical concerns of those who interact with AI systems in organizational and operational contexts. To address this gap, this study adopts a bottom-up approach to explore how governance-relevant themes are expressed in user discourse. Drawing on over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2.com, we apply BERTopic to extract latent themes and identify those most semantically related to AI governance. The analysis reveals a diverse set of governance-relevant topics spanning both technical and non-technical domains. These include concerns across organizational processes-such as planning, coordination, and communication-as well as stages of the AI value chain, including deployment infrastructure, data handling, and analytics. The findings show considerable overlap with institutional AI governance and ethics frameworks on issues like privacy and transparency, but also surface overlooked areas such as project management, strategy development, and customer interaction. This highlights the need for more empirically grounded, user-centered approaches to AI governance-approaches that complement normative models by capturing how governance unfolds in applied settings. By foregrounding how governance is enacted in practice, this study contributes to more inclusive and operationally grounded approaches to AI governance and digital policy.

Abstract: Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) disorders represent a global public health challenge due to their high morbidity and mortality. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex, inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical exam questions. The benchmark will be released at the homepage.

Abstract: Children are one of the most under-represented groups in speech technologies, as well as one of the most vulnerable in terms of privacy. Despite this, anonymization techniques targeting this population have received little attention. In this study, we seek to bridge this gap, and establish a baseline for the use of voice anonymization techniques designed for adult speech when applied to children's voices. Such an evaluation is essential, as children's speech presents a distinct set of challenges when compared to that of adults. This study comprises three children's datasets, six anonymization methods, and objective and subjective utility metrics for evaluation. Our results show that existing systems for adults are still able to protect children's voice privacy, but suffer from much higher utility degradation. In addition, our subjective study displays the challenges of automatic evaluation methods for speech quality in children's speech, highlighting the need for further research.

Abstract: Existing paradigms for ensuring AI safety, such as guardrail models and alignment training, often compromise either inference efficiency or development flexibility. We introduce Disentangled Safety Adapters (DSA), a novel framework addressing these challenges by decoupling safety-specific computations from a task-optimized base model. DSA utilizes lightweight adapters that leverage the base model's internal representations, enabling diverse and flexible safety functionalities with minimal impact on inference cost. Empirically, DSA-based safety guardrails substantially outperform comparably sized standalone models, notably improving hallucination detection (0.88 vs. 0.61 AUC on Summedits) and also excelling at classifying hate speech (0.98 vs. 0.92 on ToxiGen) and unsafe model inputs and responses (0.93 vs. 0.90 on AEGIS2.0 & BeaverTails). Furthermore, DSA-based safety alignment allows dynamic, inference-time adjustment of alignment strength and a fine-grained trade-off between instruction following performance and model safety. Importantly, combining the DSA safety guardrail with DSA safety alignment facilitates context-dependent alignment strength, boosting safety on StrongReject by 93% while maintaining 98% performance on MTBench -- a total reduction in alignment tax of 8 percentage points compared to standard safety alignment fine-tuning. Overall, DSA presents a promising path towards more modular, efficient, and adaptable AI safety and alignment.

Abstract: Transducer models have emerged as a promising choice for end-to-end ASR systems, offering a balanced trade-off between recognition accuracy, streaming capabilities, and inference speed in greedy decoding. However, beam search significantly slows down Transducers due to repeated evaluations of key network components, limiting practical applications. This paper introduces a universal method to accelerate beam search for Transducers, enabling the implementation of two optimized algorithms: ALSD++ and AES++. The proposed method utilizes batch operations, a tree-based hypothesis structure, novel blank scoring for enhanced shallow fusion, and CUDA graph execution for efficient GPU inference. This narrows the speed gap between beam and greedy modes to only 10-20% for the whole system, achieves 14-30% relative improvement in WER compared to greedy decoding, and improves shallow fusion for low-resource up to 11% compared to existing implementations. All the algorithms are open sourced.

Abstract: This paper target in addressing the challenges of underthinking and overthinking in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by introducing Reasoning Control Fields (RCF)--a novel test-time approach that injects structured control signals to guide reasoning from a tree search perspective. RCF enables models to adjust reasoning effort according to given control conditions when solving complex tasks. Additionally, we present the Control-R-4K dataset, which consists of challenging problems annotated with detailed reasoning processes and corresponding control fields. To further enhance reasoning control, we propose a Conditional Distillation Finetuning (CDF) method, which trains model--particularly Control-R-32B--to effectively adjust reasoning effort during test time. Experimental results on benchmarks such as AIME2024 and MATH500 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 32B scale while enabling a controllable Long CoT reasoning process (L-CoT). Overall, this work introduces an effective paradigm for controllable test-time scaling reasoning.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, offer compact and effective alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank updates to pretrained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global low-rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space-without increasing the total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved performance.

Abstract: Natural disasters usually affect vast areas and devastate infrastructures. Performing a timely and efficient response is crucial to minimize the impact on affected communities, and data-driven approaches are the best choice. Visual question answering (VQA) models help management teams to achieve in-depth understanding of damages. However, recently published models do not possess the ability to answer open-ended questions and only select the best answer among a predefined list of answers. If we want to ask questions with new additional possible answers that do not exist in the predefined list, the model needs to be fin-tuned/retrained on a new collected and annotated dataset, which is a time-consuming procedure. In recent years, large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have earned significant attention. These models are trained on extensive datasets and demonstrate strong performance on both unimodal and multimodal vision/language downstream tasks, often without the need for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a VLM-based zero-shot VQA (ZeShot-VQA) method, and investigate the performance of on post-disaster FloodNet dataset. Since the proposed method takes advantage of zero-shot learning, it can be applied on new datasets without fine-tuning. In addition, ZeShot-VQA is able to process and generate answers that has been not seen during the training procedure, which demonstrates its flexibility.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into global applications necessitates effective cultural alignment for meaningful and culturally-sensitive interactions. Current LLMs often lack the nuanced understanding required for diverse cultural contexts, and adapting them typically involves costly full fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a novel soft prompt fine-tuning framework that enables efficient and modular cultural alignment. Our method utilizes vectorized prompt tuning to dynamically route queries to a committee of culturally specialized 'expert' LLM configurations, created by optimizing soft prompt embeddings without altering the base model's parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances cultural sensitivity and adaptability, improving alignment scores from 0.208 to 0.820, offering a robust solution for culturally-aware LLM deployment. This research paves the way for subsequent investigations into enhanced cultural coverage and dynamic expert adaptation, crucial for realizing autonomous AI with deeply nuanced understanding in a globally interconnected world.

<title>Beyond Semantic Entropy: Boosting LLM Uncertainty Quantification with Pairwise Semantic Similarity</title>

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) can be detected by assessing the uncertainty of model outputs, typically measured using entropy. Semantic entropy (SE) enhances traditional entropy estimation by quantifying uncertainty at the semantic cluster level. However, as modern LLMs generate longer one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address these limitations, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities. Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and Llama3) and three common text generation tasks: question answering, text summarization, and machine translation. Our code is available at https://github.com/BigML-CS-UCLA/SNNE.

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in harnessing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. While existing approaches rely on grounding the discovery process within the relevant literature, effectiveness varies significantly with the quality and nature of the retrieved literature. We address the challenge of retrieving prior work whose concepts can inspire solutions for a given research problem, a task we define as Methodology Inspiration Retrieval (MIR). We construct a novel dataset tailored for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, and establish baselines. To address MIR, we build the Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG); capturing methodological lineage through citation relationships. We leverage MAG to embed an "intuitive prior" into dense retrievers for identifying patterns of methodological inspiration beyond superficial semantic similarity. This achieves significant gains of +5.4 in Recall@3 and +7.8 in Mean Average Precision (mAP) over strong baselines. Further, we adapt LLM-based re-ranking strategies to MIR, yielding additional improvements of +4.5 in Recall@3 and +4.8 in mAP. Through extensive ablation studies and qualitative analyses, we exhibit the promise of MIR in enhancing automated scientific discovery and outline avenues for advancing inspiration-driven retrieval.

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GRAG) places high demands on graph-specific retrievers. However, existing retrievers often rely on language models pretrained on plain text, limiting their effectiveness due to domain misalignment and structure ignorance. To address these challenges, we propose GPR, a graph-based retriever pretrained directly on knowledge graphs. GPR aligns natural language questions with relevant subgraphs through LLM-guided graph augmentation and employs a structure-aware objective to learn fine-grained retrieval strategies. Experiments on two datasets, three LLM backbones, and five baselines show that GPR consistently improves both retrieval quality and downstream generation, demonstrating its effectiveness as a robust retrieval solution for GRAG.

Abstract: Robot co-design, jointly optimizing morphology and control policy, remains a longstanding challenge in the robotics community, where many promising robots have been developed. However, a key limitation lies in its tendency to converge to sub-optimal designs due to the use of fixed reward functions, which fail to explore the diverse motion modes suitable for different morphologies. Here we propose RoboMoRe, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework that integrates morphology and reward shaping for co-optimization within the robot co-design loop. RoboMoRe performs a dual-stage optimization: in the coarse optimization stage, an LLM-based diversity reflection mechanism generates both diverse and high-quality morphology-reward pairs and efficiently explores their distribution. In the fine optimization stage, top candidates are iteratively refined through alternating LLM-guided reward and morphology gradient updates. RoboMoRe can optimize both efficient robot morphologies and their suited motion behaviors through reward shaping. Results demonstrate that without any task-specific prompting or predefined reward/morphology templates, RoboMoRe significantly outperforms human-engineered designs and competing methods across eight different tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the prevalence of misinformation in health topics online can inform public health policies and interventions. However, measuring such misinformation at scale remains a challenge, particularly for high-stakes but understudied topics like opioid-use disorder (OUD)--a leading cause of death in the U.S. We present the first large-scale study of OUD-related myths on YouTube, a widely-used platform for health information. With clinical experts, we validate 8 pervasive myths and release an expert-labeled video dataset. To scale labeling, we introduce MythTriage, an efficient triage pipeline that uses a lightweight model for routine cases and defers harder ones to a high-performing, but costlier, large language model (LLM). MythTriage achieves up to 0.86 macro F1-score while estimated to reduce annotation time and financial cost by over 76% compared to experts and full LLM labeling. We analyze 2.9K search results and 343K recommendations, uncovering how myths persist on YouTube and offering actionable insights for public health and platform moderation.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification, goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

Abstract: Text embedding models play a cornerstone role in AI applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While general-purpose text embedding models demonstrate strong performance on generic retrieval benchmarks, their effectiveness diminishes when applied to private datasets (e.g., company-specific proprietary data), which often contain specialized terminology and lingo. In this work, we introduce BMEmbed, a novel method for adapting general-purpose text embedding models to private datasets. By leveraging the well-established keyword-based retrieval technique (BM25), we construct supervisory signals from the ranking of keyword-based retrieval results to facilitate model adaptation. We evaluate BMEmbed across a range of domains, datasets, and models, showing consistent improvements in retrieval performance. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how BM25-based signals contribute to improving embeddings by fostering alignment and uniformity, highlighting the value of this approach in adapting models to domain-specific data. We release the source code available at https://github.com/BaileyWei/BMEmbed for the research community.

Abstract: Understanding how feature representations evolve across layers in large language models (LLMs) is key to improving their interpretability and robustness. While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to specific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent analyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered Kernel Alignment(CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning--a pattern that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions. We further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain adaptation, where fine-tuning critical layers leads to greater loss reduction compared to non-critical layers; and backdoor defense, where freezing them reduces attack success rates by up to 40%.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes, making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft, and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue, with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can be tested ``in the wild''. Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors, which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at https://github.com/ristea/xmad-bench/.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the need for up-to-date and well-organized benchmarks becomes increasingly critical. However, many existing datasets are scattered, difficult to manage, and make it challenging to perform evaluations tailored to specific needs or domains, despite the growing importance of domain-specific models in areas such as math or code. In this paper, we introduce BenchHub, a dynamic benchmark repository that empowers researchers and developers to evaluate LLMs more effectively. BenchHub aggregates and automatically classifies benchmark datasets from diverse domains, integrating 303K questions across 38 benchmarks. It is designed to support continuous updates and scalable data management, enabling flexible and customizable evaluation tailored to various domains or use cases. Through extensive experiments with various LLM families, we demonstrate that model performance varies significantly across domain-specific subsets, emphasizing the importance of domain-aware benchmarking. We believe BenchHub can encourage better dataset reuse, more transparent model comparisons, and easier identification of underrepresented areas in existing benchmarks, offering a critical infrastructure for advancing LLM evaluation research.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a widely adopted strategy for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, significantly reducing memory and computational costs. However, most existing PEFT techniques uniformly deploy LoRA adapters across all layers, disregarding the intrinsic heterogeneity of layer contributions and task-specific rank requirements. This uniform paradigm leads to redundant parameter allocation and suboptimal adaptation efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose FLoE, a novel PEFT framework that introduces two key innovations: (i) a Fisher information-guided importance scoring mechanism to dynamically identify task-critical transformer layers for MoE-based low-rank adaptation, enabling sparse adapter deployment; and (ii) a Bayesian optimization-driven rank allocator that automatically determines optimal LoRA ranks on specific datasets without exhaustive grid search. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and benchmarks reveal that FLoE achieves impressive efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, making FLoE particularly advantageous in resource-constrained environments that necessitate rapid adaptation.

Abstract: Understanding urban socioeconomic conditions through visual data is a challenging yet essential task for sustainable urban development and policy planning. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{CityLens}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language-vision models (LLVMs) in predicting socioeconomic indicators from satellite and street view imagery. We construct a multi-modal dataset covering a total of 17 globally distributed cities, spanning 6 key domains: economy, education, crime, transport, health, and environment, reflecting the multifaceted nature of urban life. Based on this dataset, we define 11 prediction tasks and utilize three evaluation paradigms: Direct Metric Prediction, Normalized Metric Estimation, and Feature-Based Regression. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art LLVMs across these tasks. Our results reveal that while LLVMs demonstrate promising perceptual and reasoning capabilities, they still exhibit limitations in predicting urban socioeconomic indicators. CityLens provides a unified framework for diagnosing these limitations and guiding future efforts in using LLVMs to understand and predict urban socioeconomic patterns. Our codes and datasets are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityLens.

Abstract: Existing attacks against multimodal language models (MLLMs) primarily communicate instructions through text accompanied by adversarial images. In contrast, we exploit the capabilities of MLLMs to interpret non-textual instructions, specifically, adversarial images or audio generated by our novel method, Con Instruction. We optimize these adversarial examples to align closely with target instructions in the embedding space, revealing the detrimental implications of MLLMs' sophisticated understanding. Unlike prior work, our method does not require training data or preprocessing of textual instructions. While these non-textual adversarial examples can effectively bypass MLLM safety mechanisms, their combination with various text inputs substantially amplifies attack success. We further introduce a new Attack Response Categorization (ARC) framework, which evaluates both the quality of the model's response and its relevance to the malicious instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that Con Instruction effectively bypasses safety mechanisms in multiple vision- and audio-language models, including LLaVA-v1.5, InternVL, Qwen-VL, and Qwen-Audio, evaluated on two standard benchmarks: AdvBench and SafeBench. Specifically, our method achieves the highest attack success rates, reaching 81.3% and 86.6% on LLaVA-v1.5 (13B). On the defense side, we explore various countermeasures against our attacks and uncover a substantial performance gap among existing techniques. Our implementation is made publicly available.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.

Abstract: Directly training Large Language Models (LLMs) for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) remains challenging due to intricate reward modeling, dynamic agent interactions, and demanding generalization requirements. This paper explores whether post-training techniques, specifically Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), can effectively $\textit{generalize}$ to multi-agent scenarios. We use economic reasoning as a testbed, leveraging its strong foundations in mathematics and game theory, its demand for structured analytical reasoning, and its relevance to real-world applications such as market design, resource allocation, and policy analysis. We introduce $\textbf{Recon}$ ($\textbf{R}$easoning like an $\textbf{ECON}$omist), a 7B-parameter open-source LLM post-trained on a hand-curated dataset of 2,100 high-quality economic reasoning problems. Comprehensive evaluation on economic reasoning benchmarks and multi-agent games reveals clear improvements in structured reasoning and economic rationality. These results underscore the promise of domain-aligned post-training for enhancing reasoning and agent alignment, shedding light on the roles of SFT and RL in shaping model behavior.

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models, regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding representation alignment across model scales.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove sensitive or undesired data from large language models. However, recent studies suggest that unlearning is often shallow, claiming that removed knowledge can easily be recovered. In this work, we critically examine standard unlearning evaluation practices and uncover key limitations that shake our trust in those findings. First, we show that some evaluations introduce substantial new information into the model, potentially masking true unlearning performance by re-teaching the model during testing. Second, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes vary significantly across tasks, undermining the generalizability of current evaluation routines. Finally, we find that many evaluations rely on spurious correlations, making their results difficult to trust and interpret. Taken together, these issues suggest that current evaluation protocols may both overstate and understate unlearning success. To address this, we propose two principles for future unlearning evaluations: minimal information injection and downstream task awareness. We validate these principles through a series of targeted experiments, showing how violations of each can lead to misleading conclusions.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

Abstract: We propose a novel discriminative model for sequence labeling called Bregman conditional random fields (BCRF). Contrary to standard linear-chain conditional random fields, BCRF allows fast parallelizable inference algorithms based on iterative Bregman projections. We show how such models can be learned using Fenchel-Young losses, including extension for learning from partial labels. Experimentally, our approach delivers comparable results to CRF while being faster, and achieves better results in highly constrained settings compared to mean field, another parallelizable alternative.

<title>LIFT the Veil for the Truth: Principal Weights Emerge after Rank Reduction for Reasoning-Focused Supervised Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on a small number of high-quality datasets can yield strong reasoning capabilities. However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters, offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared to Full FT and LoRA.

<title>HSCR: Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding for Aligning Medical Vision Language Models</title>

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have achieved success across various tasks, yet most existing methods overlook the modality misalignment issue that can lead to untrustworthy responses in clinical settings. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1) Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following, demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000 training entries.

Abstract: Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\% over baseline settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate steps remains a critical challenge even after RL.

Abstract: Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/TrajICL-project-page.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various software engineering tasks; however, their effectiveness in code migration, adapting code to run in different environments, remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we introduce CODEMENV: Code Migration Across Environment, a new benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' abilities in code migration scenarios. CODEMENV consists of 922 examples spanning 19 Python and Java packages, and covers three core tasks: (1) identifying functions incompatible with specific versions, (2) detecting changes in function definitions, and (3) adapting code to target environments. Experimental evaluation with seven LLMs on CODEMENV yields an average pass@1 rate of 26.50%, with GPT-4O achieving the highest score at 43.84%. Key findings include: (i) LLMs tend to be more proficient with newer function versions, which aids in migrating legacy code, and (ii) LLMs sometimes exhibit logical inconsistencies by identifying function changes irrelevant to the intended migration environment. The datasets are available at https://github.com/xdshen-ai/Benchmark-of-Code-Migration.

Abstract: Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition, multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.

Abstract: Human perception of events is intrinsically tied to distinguishing between completed (perfect and telic) and ongoing (durative) actions, a process mediated by both linguistic structure and visual cues. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Perfect Times} dataset, a novel, quadrilingual (English, Italian, Russian, and Japanese) multiple-choice question-answering benchmark designed to assess video-language models (VLMs) on temporal reasoning. By pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers. Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and completion within temporal and causal video dynamics, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing temporal reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) aligned with general human objectives, such as being harmless and hallucination-free, have become valuable assistants of humans in managing visual tasks. However, people with diversified backgrounds have different cognition even in the same situation. Consequently, they may have personalized expectations for VLM assistants. This highlights the urgent need to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition for real-world assistance. To study this problem, we first simplify it by characterizing individuals based on the sociological concept of Role-Set. Then, we propose to evaluate the individuals' actions to examine whether the personalized alignment is achieved. Further, we construct a benchmark named PCogAlignBench, which includes 18k instances and 20 individuals with different Role-Sets. Finally, we present a framework called PCogAlign, which constructs a cognition-aware and action-based reward model for personalized alignment. Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate the reliability of the PCogAlignBench and the effectiveness of our proposed PCogAlign. We will open-source the constructed benchmark and code at https://github.com/NLPGM/PCogAlign.

Abstract: Nonverbal communication is integral to human interaction, with gestures, facial expressions, and body language conveying critical aspects of intent and emotion. However, existing large language models (LLMs) fail to effectively incorporate these nonverbal elements, limiting their capacity to create fully immersive conversational experiences. We introduce MARS, a multimodal language model designed to understand and generate nonverbal cues alongside text, bridging this gap in conversational AI. Our key innovation is VENUS, a large-scale dataset comprising annotated videos with time-aligned text, facial expressions, and body language. Leveraging VENUS, we train MARS with a next-token prediction objective, combining text with vector-quantized nonverbal representations to achieve multimodal understanding and generation within a unified framework. Based on various analyses of the VENUS datasets, we validate its substantial scale and high effectiveness. Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that MARS successfully generates text and nonverbal languages, corresponding to conversational input.

<title>Bridging the Gap: From Ad-hoc to Proactive Search in Conversations</title>

Abstract: Proactive search in conversations (PSC) aims to reduce user effort in formulating explicit queries by proactively retrieving useful relevant information given conversational context. Previous work in PSC either directly uses this context as input to off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or further fine-tunes them on PSC data. However, ad-hoc retrievers are pre-trained on short and concise queries, while the PSC input is longer and noisier. This input mismatch between ad-hoc search and PSC limits retrieval quality. While fine-tuning on PSC data helps, its benefits remain constrained by this input gap. In this work, we propose Conv2Query, a novel conversation-to-query framework that adapts ad-hoc retrievers to PSC by bridging the input gap between ad-hoc search and PSC. Conv2Query maps conversational context into ad-hoc queries, which can either be used as input for off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or for further fine-tuning on PSC data. Extensive experiments on two PSC datasets show that Conv2Query significantly improves ad-hoc retrievers' performance, both when used directly and after fine-tuning on PSC.

<title>Simple Prompt Injection Attacks Can Leak Personal Data Observed by LLM Agents During Task Execution</title>

Abstract: Previous benchmarks on prompt injection in large language models (LLMs) have primarily focused on generic tasks and attacks, offering limited insights into more complex threats like data exfiltration. This paper examines how prompt injection can cause tool-calling agents to leak personal data observed during task execution. Using a fictitious banking agent, we develop data flow-based attacks and integrate them into AgentDojo, a recent benchmark for agentic security. To enhance its scope, we also create a richer synthetic dataset of human-AI banking conversations. In 16 user tasks from AgentDojo, LLMs show a 15-50 percentage point drop in utility under attack, with average attack success rates (ASR) around 20 percent; some defenses reduce ASR to zero. Most LLMs, even when successfully tricked by the attack, avoid leaking highly sensitive data like passwords, likely due to safety alignments, but they remain vulnerable to disclosing other personal data. The likelihood of password leakage increases when a password is requested along with one or two additional personal details. In an extended evaluation across 48 tasks, the average ASR is around 15 percent, with no built-in AgentDojo defense fully preventing leakage. Tasks involving data extraction or authorization workflows, which closely resemble the structure of exfiltration attacks, exhibit the highest ASRs, highlighting the interaction between task type, agent performance, and defense efficacy.

<title>Attention Retrieves, MLP Memorizes: Disentangling Trainable Components in the Transformer</title>

Abstract: The Transformer architecture is central to the success of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), in part due to its surprising ability to perform a wide range of algorithmic tasks -- including mathematical reasoning, memorization, and retrieval -- using only gradient-based training on next-token prediction. While the core component of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard Transformers to variants in which either the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers or the attention projectors (queries and keys) are frozen at initialization. To further isolate the contribution of attention, we introduce MixiT -- the Mixing Transformer -- a simplified, principled model in which the attention coefficients are entirely random and fixed at initialization, eliminating any input-dependent computation or learning in attention. Surprisingly, we find that MixiT matches the performance of fully trained Transformers on various algorithmic tasks, especially those involving basic arithmetic or focusing heavily on memorization. For retrieval-based tasks, we observe that having input-dependent attention coefficients is consistently beneficial, while MixiT underperforms. We attribute this failure to its inability to form specialized circuits such as induction heads -- a specific circuit known to be crucial for learning and exploiting repeating patterns in input sequences. Even more interestingly, we find that attention with frozen key and query projectors is not only able to form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling. Our results underscore the importance of architectural heterogeneity, where distinct components contribute complementary inductive biases crucial for solving different classes of tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring their outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains challenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language (DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible approach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically building a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the validity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which often incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel $\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that identifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time, significantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This further enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a large number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding engine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through comprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON generation, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that Formatron not only $\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant outputs but also achieves $\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference speed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly, Formatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release Formatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron.

Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order statistics. On the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a slight improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals are incorporated into Praat TextGrids using a point tier, and they are also output as a table for researchers to analyze separately as diagnostics or to incorporate uncertainty into their analyses.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) incorporate heterogeneous modalities into LLMs, enabling a comprehensive understanding of diverse scenarios and objects. Despite the proliferation of evaluation benchmarks and leaderboards for MLLMs, they predominantly overlook the critical capacity of MLLMs to comprehend world knowledge with structured abstractions that appear in visual form. To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm and devise M3STR, an innovative benchmark grounded in the Multi-Modal Map for STRuctured understanding. This benchmark leverages multi-modal knowledge graphs to synthesize images encapsulating subgraph architectures enriched with multi-modal entities. M3STR necessitates that MLLMs not only recognize the multi-modal entities within the visual inputs but also decipher intricate relational topologies among them. We delineate the benchmark's statistical profiles and automated construction pipeline, accompanied by an extensive empirical analysis of 26 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings reveal persistent deficiencies in processing abstractive visual information with structured knowledge, thereby charting a pivotal trajectory for advancing MLLMs' holistic reasoning capacities.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) enables humans to infer mental states-such as beliefs, desires, and intentions-forming the foundation of social cognition. However, existing computational ToM methods rely on structured workflows with ToM-specific priors or deep model fine-tuning, which struggle with scalability in multimodal environments and fail to generalize as task complexity increases. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian ToM planner that decomposes ToM reasoning into stepwise Bayesian updates. Our framework introduces weak-to-strong control, allowing smaller language models (LMs) to specialize in ToM-specific likelihood estimation and transfer their reasoning behaviors to larger LMs (7B to 405B) for integration with social and world knowledge. This synergistic approach aligns large-model inference of human mental states with Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 4.6% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art techniques on multimodal ToM benchmarks, including challenging unseen scenarios, thereby establishing a new standard for modeling human mental states in complex environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent systems that simulate real-world interactions with near-human reasoning. While previous studies have extensively examined biases related to protected attributes such as race, the emergence and propagation of biases on socially contentious issues in multi-agent LLM interactions remain underexplored. This study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the need for policy measures that promote diversity and transparency in LLM-generated discussions to mitigate the risks of bias propagation within anonymous online environments.

Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) plays a key role in speech processing, often utilizing hand-crafted or neural features. This study examines the effectiveness of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and pre-trained model (PTM) features, including wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, UniSpeech, MMS, and Whisper. We propose FusionVAD, a unified framework that combines both feature types using three fusion strategies: concatenation, addition, and cross-attention (CA). Experimental results reveal that simple fusion techniques, particularly addition, outperform CA in both accuracy and efficiency. Fusion-based models consistently surpass single-feature models, highlighting the complementary nature of MFCCs and PTM features. Notably, our best-performing fusion model exceeds the state-of-the-art Pyannote across multiple datasets, achieving an absolute average improvement of 2.04%. These results confirm that simple feature fusion enhances VAD robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scientist represents a paradigm shift in scientific discovery, with large language models (LLMs) taking the lead as the primary executor in the entire scientific workflow from idea generation to experiment implementation. Recent AI Scientist studies demonstrate sufficient capabilities for independent scientific discovery, with the generated research reports gaining acceptance at the ICLR 2025 workshop and ACL 2025, arguing that a human-level AI Scientist, capable of uncovering phenomena previously unknown to humans, may be imminent. Despite this substantial progress, AI Scientist has yet to produce a groundbreaking achievement in the domain of computer science on par with automated scientific tools. Based on extensive quantitative evidence from existing benchmarks in complex engineering tasks and a systematic evaluation assess 28 research papers generated by five advanced AI Scientist systems, we argue that \textbf{the fundamental bottleneck for AI Scientists lies in their capability to execute the requisite verification procedures.} Current AI Scientist systems lack the execution capabilities needed to execute rigorous experiments and produce high-quality scientific papers. To better illustrate the root cause of this \textbf{implementation gap}, we provide an in-depth discussion on the fundamental limitations of AI Scientist. This position paper aims to call for the participants in the community to bridge the implementation gap.

Abstract: The recent progress of large language model agents has opened new possibilities for automating tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs), especially in mobile environments where intelligent interaction can greatly enhance usability. However, practical deployment of such agents remains constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover, most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices. AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and $91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.

<title>Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/RAIF.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in handling complex interactive problems. Existing LLM agents mainly generate natural language plans to guide reasoning, which is verbose and inefficient. NL plans are also tailored to specific tasks and restrict agents' ability to generalize across similar tasks. To this end, we explore pseudocode-style plans (P-code Plan) to capture the structural logic of reasoning. We find that P-code Plan empowers LLM agents with stronger generalization ability and more efficiency. Inspired by this finding, we propose a pseudocode-style Planning Guided Preference Optimization method called PGPO for effective agent learning. With two planning-oriented rewards, PGPO further enhances LLM agents' ability to generate high-quality P-code Plans and subsequent reasoning. Experiments show that PGPO achieves superior performance on representative agent benchmarks and outperforms the current leading baselines. Analyses reveal the advantage of PGPO in reducing action errors and omissions during reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding the interaction between different drugs (drug-drug interaction or DDI) is critical for ensuring patient safety and optimizing therapeutic outcomes. Existing DDI datasets primarily focus on textual information, overlooking multimodal data that reflect complex drug mechanisms. In this paper, we (1) introduce MUDI, a large-scale Multimodal biomedical dataset for Understanding pharmacodynamic Drug-drug Interactions, and (2) benchmark learning methods to study it. In brief, MUDI provides a comprehensive multimodal representation of drugs by combining pharmacological text, chemical formulas, molecular structure graphs, and images across 310,532 annotated drug pairs labeled as Synergism, Antagonism, or New Effect. Crucially, to effectively evaluate machine-learning based generalization, MUDI consists of unseen drug pairs in the test set. We evaluate benchmark models using both late fusion voting and intermediate fusion strategies. All data, annotations, evaluation scripts, and baselines are released under an open research license.

Abstract: We introduce LinearVC, a simple voice conversion method that sheds light on the structure of self-supervised representations. First, we show that simple linear transformations of self-supervised features effectively convert voices. Next, we probe the geometry of the feature space by constraining the set of allowed transformations. We find that just rotating the features is sufficient for high-quality voice conversion. This suggests that content information is embedded in a low-dimensional subspace which can be linearly transformed to produce a target voice. To validate this hypothesis, we finally propose a method that explicitly factorizes content and speaker information using singular value decomposition; the resulting linear projection with a rank of just 100 gives competitive conversion results. Our work has implications for both practical voice conversion and a broader understanding of self-supervised speech representations. Samples and code: https://www.kamperh.com/linearvc/.

Abstract: Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.

Abstract: Modern Slavery Acts mandate that corporations disclose their efforts to combat modern slavery, aiming to enhance transparency and strengthen practices for its eradication. However, verifying these statements remains challenging due to their complex, diversified language and the sheer number of statements that must be reviewed. The development of NLP tools to assist in this task is also difficult due to a scarcity of annotated data. Furthermore, as modern slavery transparency legislation has been introduced in several countries, the generalizability of such tools across legal jurisdictions must be studied. To address these challenges, we work with domain experts to make two key contributions. First, we present AIMS.uk and AIMS.ca, newly annotated datasets from the UK and Canada to enable cross-jurisdictional evaluation. Second, we introduce AIMSCheck, an end-to-end framework for compliance validation. AIMSCheck decomposes the compliance assessment task into three levels, enhancing interpretability and practical applicability. Our experiments show that models trained on an Australian dataset generalize well across UK and Canadian jurisdictions, demonstrating the potential for broader application in compliance monitoring. We release the benchmark datasets and AIMSCheck to the public to advance AI-adoption in compliance assessment and drive further research in this field.

Abstract: Generative recommendation is an emerging paradigm that leverages the extensive knowledge of large language models by formulating recommendations into a text-to-text generation task. However, existing studies face two key limitations in (i) incorporating implicit item relationships and (ii) utilizing rich yet lengthy item information. To address these challenges, we propose a Generative Recommender via semantic-Aware Multi-granular late fusion (GRAM), introducing two synergistic innovations. First, we design semantic-to-lexical translation to encode implicit hierarchical and collaborative item relationships into the vocabulary space of LLMs. Second, we present multi-granular late fusion to integrate rich semantics efficiently with minimal information loss. It employs separate encoders for multi-granular prompts, delaying the fusion until the decoding stage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GRAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art generative recommendation models, achieving significant improvements of 11.5-16.0% in Recall@5 and 5.3-13.6% in NDCG@5.

Abstract: Querying generative AI models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), has become a prevalent method for information acquisition. However, existing query-answer datasets primarily focus on textual responses, making it challenging to address complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark, RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V) models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds 4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries, pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.

Abstract: Large language models are quickly becoming the foundation for intelligent agents that are capable of using tools. However, training such agents is challenging because it requires human creation and annotation of a diverse set of tasks, tools, and evaluation criteria. In this paper, we propose the Self-Challenging framework for training an agent on high-quality tasks that are generated by itself. The agent first plays the role of challenger and generates a task after interacting with the given tools. The tasks take the form of a novel general class of problems termed Code-as-Task, which are defined by an instruction, a verification function and solution and failure cases which serve as tests, allowing to filter only for high-quality tasks. The agent then takes an executor role and trains on those tasks with reinforcement learning using the evaluation feedback as a reward. Evaluation on two existing multi-turn tool-use agent benchmarks, M3ToolEval and TauBench, shows the Self-Challenging framework achieves over a two-fold improvement in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, despite using only self-generated training data.

<title>Datasheets Aren't Enough: DataRubrics for Automated Quality Metrics and Accountability</title>

Abstract: High-quality datasets are fundamental to training and evaluating machine learning models, yet their creation-especially with accurate human annotations-remains a significant challenge. Many dataset paper submissions lack originality, diversity, or rigorous quality control, and these shortcomings are often overlooked during peer review. Submissions also frequently omit essential details about dataset construction and properties. While existing tools such as datasheets aim to promote transparency, they are largely descriptive and do not provide standardized, measurable methods for evaluating data quality. Similarly, metadata requirements at conferences promote accountability but are inconsistently enforced. To address these limitations, this position paper advocates for the integration of systematic, rubric-based evaluation metrics into the dataset review process-particularly as submission volumes continue to grow. We also explore scalable, cost-effective methods for synthetic data generation, including dedicated tools and LLM-as-a-judge approaches, to support more efficient evaluation. As a call to action, we introduce DataRubrics, a structured framework for assessing the quality of both human- and model-generated datasets. Leveraging recent advances in LLM-based evaluation, DataRubrics offers a reproducible, scalable, and actionable solution for dataset quality assessment, enabling both authors and reviewers to uphold higher standards in data-centric research. We also release code to support reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations at https://github.com/datarubrics/datarubrics.

<title>Unified Scaling Laws for Compressed Representations</title>

Abstract: Scaling laws have shaped recent advances in machine learning by enabling predictable scaling of model performance based on model size, computation, and data volume. Concurrently, the rise in computational cost for AI has motivated model compression techniques, notably quantization and sparsification, which have emerged to mitigate the steep computational demands associated with large-scale training and inference. This paper investigates the interplay between scaling laws and compression formats, exploring whether a unified scaling framework can accurately predict model performance when training occurs over various compressed representations, such as sparse, scalar-quantized, sparse-quantized or even vector-quantized formats. Our key contributions include validating a general scaling law formulation and showing that it is applicable both individually but also composably across compression types. Based on this, our main finding is demonstrating both theoretically and empirically that there exists a simple "capacity" metric -- based on the representation's ability to fit random Gaussian data -- which can robustly predict parameter efficiency across multiple compressed representations. On the practical side, we extend our formulation to directly compare the accuracy potential of different compressed formats, and to derive better algorithms for training over sparse-quantized formats.

<title>When Should Dense Retrievers Be Updated in Evolving Corpora? Detecting Out-of-Distribution Corpora Using GradNormIR</title>

Abstract: Dense retrievers encode texts into embeddings to efficiently retrieve relevant documents from large databases in response to user queries. However, real-world corpora continually evolve, leading to a shift from the original training distribution of the retriever. Without timely updates or retraining, indexing newly emerging documents can degrade retrieval performance for future queries. Thus, identifying when a dense retriever requires an update is critical for maintaining robust retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose a novel task of predicting whether a corpus is out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to a dense retriever before indexing. Addressing this task allows us to proactively manage retriever updates, preventing potential retrieval failures. We introduce GradNormIR, an unsupervised approach that leverages gradient norms to detect OOD corpora effectively. Experiments on the BEIR benchmark demonstrate that GradNormIR enables timely updates of dense retrievers in evolving document collections, significantly enhancing retrieval robustness and efficiency.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for appropriate system action. This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.

Abstract: Vision-language models pre-trained on large scale of unlabeled biomedical images and associated reports learn generalizable semantic representations. These multi-modal representations can benefit various downstream tasks in the biomedical domain. Contrastive learning is widely used to pre-train vision-language models for general natural images and associated captions. Despite its popularity, we found biomedical texts have complex and domain-specific semantics that are often neglected by common contrastive methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, perturbed report discrimination, for pre-train biomedical vision-language models. First, we curate a set of text perturbation methods that keep the same words, but disrupt the semantic structure of the sentence. Next, we apply different types of perturbation to reports, and use the model to distinguish the original report from the perturbed ones given the associated image. Parallel to this, we enhance the sensitivity of our method to higher level of granularity for both modalities by contrasting attention-weighted image sub-regions and sub-words in the image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple downstream tasks, and our method outperforms strong baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach learns more semantic meaningful and robust multi-modal representations.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning not only enhances large language model performance but also provides critical insights into decision-making processes, marking it as a useful tool for monitoring model intent and planning. By proactively preventing models from acting on CoT indicating misaligned or harmful intent, CoT monitoring can be used to reduce risks associated with deploying models. However, developers may be incentivized to train away the appearance of harmful intent from CoT traces, by either customer preferences or regulatory requirements. Recent works have shown that banning mention of a specific example of reward hacking, which may be done either to make CoT presentable to users or as a naive attempt to prevent the behavior, causes obfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the undesired behavior. Such obfuscation threatens the reliability of CoT monitoring. However, obfuscation of reasoning can be due to its internalization to latent space computation, or its encoding within the CoT. Here, we provide an extension to these results. First, we show that penalizing the use of specific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to substitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying method by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can learn to steganographically encode its reasoning. We further demonstrate that models can generalize an encoding scheme. When the penalized strings belong to an overarching class, the model learns not only to substitute strings seen in training, but also develops a general encoding scheme for all members of the class which it can apply to held-out testing strings.

Abstract: Prior methods for controlling image generation are limited in their ability to be taught new tasks. In contrast, vision-language models, or VLMs, can learn tasks in-context and produce the correct outputs for a given input. We propose a dual-process distillation scheme that allows feed-forward image generators to learn new tasks from deliberative VLMs. Our scheme uses a VLM to rate the generated images and backpropagates this gradient to update the weights of the image generator. Our general framework enables a wide variety of new control tasks through the same text-and-image based interface. We showcase a handful of applications of this technique for different types of control signals, such as commonsense inferences and visual prompts. With our method, users can implement multimodal controls for properties such as color palette, line weight, horizon position, and relative depth within a matter of minutes.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are capable of interpreting input strings as instructions, or prompts, and carry out tasks based on them. Unlike traditional learners, LLMs cannot use back-propagation to obtain feedback, and condition their output in situ in a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Many approaches to prompting and pre-training these models involve the automated generation of these prompts, also known as meta-prompting, or prompting to obtain prompts. However, they do not formally describe the properties and behavior of the LLMs themselves. We propose a theoretical framework based on category theory to generalize and describe ICL and LLM behavior when interacting with users. Our framework allows us to obtain formal results around task agnosticity and equivalence of various meta-prompting approaches. Using our framework and experimental results we argue that meta-prompting is more effective than basic prompting at generating desirable outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive few-shot generalization on many tasks via in-context learning (ICL). Despite their success in showing such emergent abilities, the scale and complexity of larger models also lead to unprecedentedly high computational demands and deployment challenges. In reaction, researchers explore transferring the powerful capabilities of larger models to more efficient and compact models by typically aligning the output of smaller (student) models with that of larger (teacher) models. Existing methods either train student models on the generated outputs of teacher models or imitate their token-level probability distributions. However, these distillation methods pay little to no attention to the input, which also plays a crucial role in ICL. Based on the finding that the performance of ICL is highly sensitive to the selection of demonstration examples, we propose Bidirectional Alignment (BiAlign) to fully leverage the models' preferences for ICL examples to improve the ICL abilities of student models. Specifically, we introduce the alignment of input preferences between student and teacher models by incorporating a novel ranking loss, in addition to aligning the token-level output distribution. With extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that BiAlign can consistently outperform existing baselines on a variety of tasks involving language understanding, reasoning, and coding.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have recently achieved astonishing results in image quality, flexibility, and text alignment, and are consequently employed in a fast-growing number of applications. Through improvements in multilingual abilities, a larger community now has access to this technology. However, our results show that multilingual models suffer from significant gender biases just as monolingual models do. Furthermore, the natural expectation that multilingual models will provide similar results across languages does not hold up. Instead, there are important differences between languages. We propose a novel benchmark, MAGBIG, intended to foster research on gender bias in multilingual models. We use MAGBIG to investigate the effect of multilingualism on gender bias in T2I models. To this end, we construct multilingual prompts requesting portraits of people with a certain occupation or trait. Our results show that not only do models exhibit strong gender biases but they also behave differently across languages. Furthermore, we investigate prompt engineering strategies, such as indirect, neutral formulations, to mitigate these biases. Unfortunately, these approaches have limited success and result in worse text-to-image alignment. Consequently, we call for more research into diverse representations across languages in image generators, as well as into steerability to address biased model behavior.

Abstract: We study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) latently perform multi-hop reasoning with complex prompts such as "The mother of the singer of 'Superstition' is". We look for evidence of a latent reasoning pathway where an LLM (1) latently identifies "the singer of 'Superstition'" as Stevie Wonder, the bridge entity, and (2) uses its knowledge of Stevie Wonder's mother to complete the prompt. We analyze these two hops individually and consider their co-occurrence as indicative of latent multi-hop reasoning. For the first hop, we test if changing the prompt to indirectly mention the bridge entity instead of any other entity increases the LLM's internal recall of the bridge entity. For the second hop, we test if increasing this recall causes the LLM to better utilize what it knows about the bridge entity. We find strong evidence of latent multi-hop reasoning for the prompts of certain relation types, with the reasoning pathway used in more than 80% of the prompts. However, the utilization is highly contextual, varying across different types of prompts. Also, on average, the evidence for the second hop and the full multi-hop traversal is rather moderate and only substantial for the first hop. Moreover, we find a clear scaling trend with increasing model size for the first hop of reasoning but not for the second hop. Our experimental findings suggest potential challenges and opportunities for future development and applications of LLMs.

Abstract: Social biases can manifest in language agency. However, very limited research has investigated such biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content. In addition, previous works often rely on string-matching techniques to identify agentic and communal words within texts, falling short of accurately classifying language agency. We introduce the Language Agency Bias Evaluation (LABE) benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates biases in LLMs by analyzing agency levels attributed to different demographic groups in model generations. LABE tests for gender, racial, and intersectional language agency biases in LLMs on 3 text generation tasks: biographies, professor reviews, and reference letters. Using LABE, we unveil language agency social biases in 3 recent LLMs: ChatGPT, Llama3, and Mistral. We observe that: (1) LLM generations tend to demonstrate greater gender bias than human-written texts; (2) Models demonstrate remarkably higher levels of intersectional bias than the other bias aspects. (3) Prompt-based mitigation is unstable and frequently leads to bias exacerbation. Based on our observations, we propose Mitigation via Selective Rewrite (MSR), a novel bias mitigation strategy that leverages an agency classifier to identify and selectively revise parts of generated texts that demonstrate communal traits. Empirical results prove MSR to be more effective and reliable than prompt-based mitigation method, showing a promising research direction.

<title>Relevant or Random: Can LLMs Truly Perform Analogical Reasoning?</title>

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is a unique ability of humans to address unfamiliar challenges by transferring strategies from relevant past experiences. One key finding in psychology is that compared with irrelevant past experiences, recalling relevant ones can help humans better handle new tasks. Coincidentally, the NLP community has also recently found that self-generating relevant examples in the context can help large language models (LLMs) better solve a given problem than hand-crafted prompts. However, it is yet not clear whether relevance is the key factor eliciting such capability, i.e., can LLMs benefit more from self-generated relevant examples than irrelevant ones? In this work, we systematically explore whether LLMs can truly perform analogical reasoning on a diverse set of reasoning tasks. With extensive experiments and analysis, we show that self-generated random examples can surprisingly achieve comparable or even better performance on certain tasks, e.g., 4% performance boost on GSM8K with random biological examples. We find that the accuracy of self-generated examples is the key factor and subsequently design two novel methods with improved performance and significantly reduced inference costs. Overall, we aim to advance a deeper understanding of LLM analogical reasoning and hope this work stimulates further research in the design of self-generated contexts.

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, aligning these models with human values remains a significant challenge. Recent studies show that reasoning abilities contribute significantly to model safety, while integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures can further enhance alignment. In this work, we address a fundamental question: How to effectively incorporate reasoning abilities and MoE architectures into self-alignment process in LLMs? We propose Mixture of insighTful Experts (MoTE), a novel framework that synergistically combines reasoning chains and expert mixtures to improve self-alignments. From a data perspective, MoTE employs a structured reasoning chain comprising four key stages: Question Analysis, Answer Guidance, Safe Answer, and Safety Checking. This approach enhances safety through multi-step reasoning and proves effective even for smaller and less powerful LLMs (e.g., 7B models). From an architectural perspective, MoTE adopts a multi-LoRA framework with step-level routing, where each expert is dedicated to a specific reasoning step. This design eliminates the need for balance losses, ensures stable training, and supports adaptive inference lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that MoTE significantly improves model safety, jailbreak resistance, and over-refusal capabilities, achieving performance comparable to OpenAI's state-of-the-art o1 model.

<title>Anchored Answers: Unravelling Positional Bias in GPT-2's Multiple-Choice Questions</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT-4 and LLaMA families, have demonstrated considerable success across diverse tasks, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, these models exhibit a positional bias, particularly an even worse anchored bias in the GPT-2 family, where they consistently favour the first choice 'A' in MCQs during inference. This anchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2's decision-making process, as it skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the choices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability approach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for this bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention heads, using the "logit lens" method to trace and modify the specific value vectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and recalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first choice 'A', we effectively mitigate the anchored bias. Our interventions not only mitigate the bias but also improve the overall MCQ prediction accuracy for the GPT-2 family across various datasets. This work represents the first comprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias from the failing cases in MCQs within the GPT-2 models, introducing targeted, minimal-intervention strategies that significantly enhance GPT2 model robustness and accuracy in MCQs.

Abstract: Lexicon or dictionary generation across domains has the potential for societal impact, as it can potentially enhance information accessibility for a diverse user base while preserving language identity. Prior work in the field primarily focuses on bilingual lexical induction, which deals with word alignments using mapping or corpora-based approaches. However, these approaches do not cater to domain-specific lexicon generation that consists of domain-specific terminology. This task becomes particularly important in specialized medical, engineering, and other technical domains, owing to the highly infrequent usage of the terms and scarcity of data involving domain-specific terms especially for low/mid-resource languages. In this paper, we propose a new model to generate dictionary words for $6$ Indian languages in the multi-domain setting. Our model consists of domain-specific and domain-generic layers that encode information, and these layers are invoked via a learnable routing technique. We also release a new benchmark dataset consisting of >75K translation pairs across 6 Indian languages spanning 8 diverse domains.We conduct both zero-shot and few-shot experiments across multiple domains to show the efficacy of our proposed model in generalizing to unseen domains and unseen languages. Additionally, we also perform a post-hoc human evaluation on unseen languages. The source code and dataset is present at https://github.com/Atulkmrsingh/lexgen.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting demonstrates varying performance under different reasoning tasks. Previous work attempts to evaluate it but falls short in providing an in-depth analysis of patterns that influence the CoT. In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm to mitigate this issue, in which we recall extra information from the question to enhance the CoT generation and evaluate CoTs based on their information gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances both the faithfulness and effectiveness of CoT.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrate significant potential in the medical domain and are often evaluated using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) modeled on exams like the USMLE. However, such benchmarks may overestimate true clinical understanding by rewarding pattern recognition and test-taking heuristics. To investigate this, we created a fictional medical benchmark centered on an imaginary organ, the Glianorex, allowing us to separate memorized knowledge from reasoning ability. We generated textbooks and MCQs in English and French using leading LLMs, then evaluated proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific models in a zero-shot setting. Despite the fictional content, models achieved an average score of 64%, while physicians scored only 27%. Fine-tuned medical models outperformed base models in English but not in French. Ablation and interpretability analyses revealed that models frequently relied on shallow cues, test-taking strategies, and hallucinated reasoning to identify the correct choice. These results suggest that standard MCQ-based evaluations may not effectively measure clinical reasoning and highlight the need for more robust, clinically meaningful assessment methods for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) usually only provide users with the inference APIs, namely the emerging Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) setting. To adapt MaaS PLMs to downstream tasks without accessing their parameters and gradients, some existing methods focus on the output-side adaptation of PLMs, viewing the PLM as an encoder and then optimizing a task-specific decoder for decoding the output hidden states and class scores of the PLM. Despite the effectiveness of these methods, they only use a single prompt to query PLMs for decoding, leading to a heavy reliance on the quality of the adopted prompt. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-Prompting Decoder (MPD) framework for MaaS adaptation. The core idea is to query PLMs with multiple different prompts for each sample, thereby obtaining multiple output hidden states and class scores for subsequent decoding. Such multi-prompting decoding paradigm can simultaneously mitigate reliance on the quality of a single prompt, alleviate the issue of data scarcity under the few-shot setting, and provide richer knowledge extracted from PLMs. Specifically, we propose two decoding strategies: multi-prompting decoding with optimal transport for hidden states and calibrated decoding for class scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language understanding datasets under the few-shot setting.

<title>RAEmoLLM: Retrieval Augmented LLMs for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection Using In-Context Learning Based on Emotional Information</title>

Abstract: Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics, health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on effort- and resource-intensive fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call {\em affect}). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. RAEmoLLM includes three modules. (1) In the index construction module, we apply an emotional LLM to obtain affective embeddings from all domains to construct a retrieval database. (2) The retrieval module uses the database to recommend top K examples (text-label pairs) from source domain data for target domain contents. (3) These examples are adopted as few-shot demonstrations for the inference module to process the target domain content. The RAEmoLLM can effectively enhance the general performance of LLMs in cross-domain misinformation detection tasks through affect-based retrieval, without fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the other few-shot methods on three datasets, with the highest increases of 15.64%, 31.18%, and 15.73% respectively.

Abstract: Finetuning language models (LMs) is crucial for adapting the models to downstream data and tasks. However, full finetuning is usually costly. Existing work, such as parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT), often focuses on \textit{how to finetune} but neglects the issue of \textit{where to finetune}. As a pioneering work on reducing the cost of backpropagation (at the layer level) by answering where to finetune, we conduct a semantic analysis of the LM inference process. We first propose using transition traces of the latent representation to compute deviations (or loss). Then, using a derived formula of scaling law, we estimate the gain of each layer in reducing deviation (or loss). Further, we narrow down the scope for finetuning, and also, study the cost-benefit balance of LM finetuning. We perform extensive experiments across well-known LMs and datasets. The results show that our approach is effective and efficient, and outperforms the existing baselines. Our approach is orthogonal to other techniques for improving finetuning efficiency, such as PEFT methods, offering practical values on LM finetuning.

Abstract: This paper introduces BMIKE-53, a comprehensive benchmark for cross-lingual in-context knowledge editing (IKE) across 53 languages, unifying three knowledge editing (KE) datasets: zsRE, CounterFact, and WikiFactDiff. Cross-lingual KE, which requires knowledge edited in one language to generalize across others while preserving unrelated knowledge, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate IKE under zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot setups, incorporating tailored metric-specific demonstrations. Our findings reveal that model scale and demonstration alignment critically govern cross-lingual IKE efficacy, with larger models and tailored demonstrations significantly improving performance. Linguistic properties, particularly script type, strongly influence performance variation across languages, with non-Latin languages underperforming due to issues like language confusion. Code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/ercong21/MultiKnow/.

Abstract: There is an increasing trend towards evaluating NLP models with LLMs instead of human judgments, raising questions about the validity of these evaluations, as well as their reproducibility in the case of proprietary models. We provide JUDGE-BENCH, an extensible collection of 20 NLP datasets with human annotations covering a broad range of evaluated properties and types of data, and comprehensively evaluate 11 current LLMs, covering both open-weight and proprietary models, for their ability to replicate the annotations. Our evaluations show substantial variance across models and datasets. Models are reliable evaluators on some tasks, but overall display substantial variability depending on the property being evaluated, the expertise level of the human judges, and whether the language is human or model-generated. We conclude that LLMs should be carefully validated against human judgments before being used as evaluators.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended the success of large language models (LLMs) to multiple data types, such as image, text and audio, achieving significant performance in various domains, including multimodal translation, visual question answering and content generation. Nonetheless, existing systems are inefficient to train MLLMs due to substantial GPU bubbles caused by the heterogeneous modality models and complex data dependencies in 3D parallelism. This paper proposes Optimus, a distributed MLLM training system that reduces end-to-end MLLM training time. Optimus is based on our principled analysis that scheduling the encoder computation within the LLM bubbles can reduce bubbles in MLLM training. To make scheduling encoder computation possible for all GPUs, Optimus searches the separate parallel plans for encoder and LLM, and adopts a bubble scheduling algorithm to enable exploiting LLM bubbles without breaking the original data dependencies in the MLLM model architecture. We further decompose encoder layer computation into a series of kernels, and analyze the common bubble pattern of 3D parallelism to carefully optimize the sub-millisecond bubble scheduling, minimizing the overall training time. Our experiments in a production cluster show that Optimus accelerates MLLM training by 20.5%-21.3% with ViT-22B and GPT-175B model over 3072 GPUs compared to baselines.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial method for addressing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). While recent research has extended RAG models to complex noisy scenarios, these explorations often confine themselves to limited noise types and presuppose that noise is inherently detrimental to LLMs, potentially deviating from real-world retrieval environments and restricting practical applicability. In this paper, we define seven distinct noise types from a linguistic perspective and establish a Noise RAG Benchmark (NoiserBench), a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing multiple datasets and reasoning tasks. Through empirical evaluation of eight representative LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, we reveal that these noises can be further categorized into two practical groups: noise that is beneficial to LLMs (aka beneficial noise) and noise that is harmful to LLMs (aka harmful noise). While harmful noise generally impairs performance, beneficial noise may enhance several aspects of model capabilities and overall performance. Our analysis offers insights for developing more robust, adaptable RAG solutions and mitigating hallucinations across diverse retrieval scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/jinyangwu/NoiserBench.

Abstract: We perform a critical examination of the scientific methodology behind contemporary large language model (LLM) research. For this we assess over 2,000 research works released between 2020 and 2024 based on criteria typical of what is considered good research (e.g. presence of statistical tests and reproducibility), and cross-validate it with arguments that are at the centre of controversy (e.g., claims of emergent behaviour). We find multiple trends, such as declines in ethics disclaimers, a rise of LLMs as evaluators, and an increase on claims of LLM reasoning abilities without leveraging human evaluation. We note that conference checklists are effective at curtailing some of these issues, but balancing velocity and rigour in research cannot solely rely on these. We tie all these findings to findings from recent meta-reviews and extend recommendations on how to address what does, does not, and should work in LLM research.

Abstract: Generative models have become widely used in biomedical entity linking (BioEL) due to their excellent performance and efficient memory usage. However, these models are usually trained only with positive samples, i.e., entities that match the input mention's identifier, and do not explicitly learn from hard negative samples, which are entities that look similar but have different meanings. To address this limitation, we introduce ANGEL (Learning from Negative Samples in Biomedical Generative Entity Linking), the first framework that trains generative BioEL models using negative samples. Specifically, a generative model is initially trained to generate positive entity names from the knowledge base for given input entities. Subsequently, both correct and incorrect outputs are gathered from the model's top-k predictions. Finally, the model is updated to prioritize the correct predictions through preference optimization. Our models outperform the previous best baseline models by up to an average top-1 accuracy of 1.4% on five benchmarks. When incorporating our framework into pre-training, the performance improvement increases further to 1.7%, demonstrating its effectiveness in both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/ANGEL.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for evaluating LLMs' capacity to balance instruction-following with critical reasoning when presented with multiple-choice questions containing no valid answers. Through systematic evaluation across arithmetic, domain-specific knowledge, and high-stakes medical decision tasks, we demonstrate that post-training aligned models often default to selecting invalid options, while base models exhibit improved refusal capabilities that scale with model size. Our analysis reveals that alignment techniques, though intended to enhance helpfulness, can inadvertently impair models' reflective judgment--the ability to override default behaviors when faced with invalid options. We additionally conduct a parallel human study showing similar instruction-following biases, with implications for how these biases may propagate through human feedback datasets used in alignment. We provide extensive ablation studies examining the impact of model size, training techniques, and prompt engineering. Our findings highlight fundamental tensions between alignment optimization and preservation of critical reasoning capabilities, with important implications for developing more robust AI systems for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Critical text assessment is at the core of many expert activities, such as fact-checking, peer review, and essay grading. Yet, existing work treats critical text assessment as a black box problem, limiting interpretability and human-AI collaboration. To close this gap, we introduce Structured Reasoning In Critical Text Assessment (STRICTA), a novel specification framework to model text assessment as an explicit, step-wise reasoning process. STRICTA breaks down the assessment into a graph of interconnected reasoning steps drawing on causality theory (Pearl, 1995). This graph is populated based on expert interaction data and used to study the assessment process and facilitate human-AI collaboration. We formally define STRICTA and apply it in a study on biomedical paper assessment, resulting in a dataset of over 4000 reasoning steps from roughly 40 biomedical experts on more than 20 papers. We use this dataset to empirically study expert reasoning in critical text assessment, and investigate if LLMs are able to imitate and support experts within these workflows. The resulting tools and datasets pave the way for studying collaborative expert-AI reasoning in text assessment, in peer review and beyond.

Abstract: Chinese, as a linguistic system rich in depth and complexity, is characterized by distinctive elements such as ancient poetry, proverbs, idioms, and other cultural constructs. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in these specialized domains, highlighting the need for the development of comprehensive datasets that can assess, continuously update, and progressively improve these culturally-grounded linguistic competencies through targeted training optimizations. To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques reveals opportunities to advance the correction of Chinese knowledge. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.

Abstract: We introduce Diffusion-based Audio Captioning (DAC), a non-autoregressive diffusion model tailored for diverse and efficient audio captioning. Although existing captioning models relying on language backbones have achieved remarkable success in various captioning tasks, their insufficient performance in terms of generation speed and diversity impede progress in audio understanding and multimedia applications. Our diffusion-based framework offers unique advantages stemming from its inherent stochasticity and holistic context modeling in captioning. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that DAC not only achieves SOTA performance levels compared to existing benchmarks in the caption quality, but also significantly outperforms them in terms of generation speed and diversity. The success of DAC illustrates that text generation can also be seamlessly integrated with audio and visual generation tasks using a diffusion backbone, paving the way for a unified, audio-related generative model across different modalities.

<title>A is for Absorption: Studying Feature Splitting and Absorption in Sparse Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) aim to decompose the activation space of large language models (LLMs) into human-interpretable latent directions or features. As we increase the number of features in the SAE, hierarchical features tend to split into finer features ("math" may split into "algebra", "geometry", etc.), a phenomenon referred to as feature splitting. However, we show that sparse decomposition and splitting of hierarchical features is not robust. Specifically, we show that seemingly monosemantic features fail to fire where they should, and instead get "absorbed" into their children features. We coin this phenomenon feature absorption, and show that it is caused by optimizing for sparsity in SAEs whenever the underlying features form a hierarchy. We introduce a metric to detect absorption in SAEs, and validate our findings empirically on hundreds of LLM SAEs. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE sizes or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue. We discuss the implications of feature absorption in SAEs and some potential approaches to solve the fundamental theoretical issues before SAEs can be used for interpreting LLMs robustly and at scale.

<title>Scalable Fine-tuning from Multiple Data Sources: A First-Order Approximation Approach</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of fine-tuning a language model (LM) for a target task by optimally using the information from $n$ auxiliary tasks. This problem has broad applications in NLP, such as targeted instruction tuning and data selection in chain-of-thought fine-tuning. The key challenge of this problem is that not all auxiliary tasks are beneficial in improving the performance of the target task. Thus, selecting the right subset of auxiliary tasks is crucial. Conventional subset selection methods, such as forward and backward stepwise selection, are unsuitable for LM fine-tuning because they require repeated training on subsets of auxiliary tasks. This paper introduces a new algorithm for estimating model fine-tuning performance without requiring repeated training. Our algorithm first performs multitask training using data from all tasks to obtain a meta initialization. Then, we approximate the model fine-tuning loss of a subset using functional values and gradients from the meta initialization. Empirically, we find that this gradient-based approximation holds with remarkable accuracy for twelve transformer-based LMs. Thus, we can now estimate fine-tuning performances on CPUs within a few seconds. Finally, we fine-tune the pretrained base model once on the selected subset of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to validate this approach, delivering a speedup of $30\times$ over conventional subset selection while incurring only $1\%$ error of the true fine-tuning performances. In downstream evaluations involving both instruction tuning and chain-of-thought fine-tuning, this loss-based selection approach improves over prior gradient or representation similarity-based methods for subset selection by up to $3.8\%$.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an established and dynamic field. Despite this, what constitutes NLP research remains debated. In this work, we address the question by quantitatively examining NLP research papers. We propose a taxonomy of research contributions and introduce NLPContributions, a dataset of nearly $2k$ NLP research paper abstracts, carefully annotated to identify scientific contributions and classify their types according to this taxonomy. We also introduce a novel task of automatically identifying contribution statements and classifying their types from research papers. We present experimental results for this task and apply our model to $\sim$$29k$ NLP research papers to analyze their contributions, aiding in the understanding of the nature of NLP research. We show that NLP research has taken a winding path -- with the focus on language and human-centric studies being prominent in the 1970s and 80s, tapering off in the 1990s and 2000s, and starting to rise again since the late 2010s. Alongside this revival, we observe a steady rise in dataset and methodological contributions since the 1990s, such that today, on average, individual NLP papers contribute in more ways than ever before. Our dataset and analyses offer a powerful lens for tracing research trends and offer potential for generating informed, data-driven literature surveys.

Abstract: In this work, we present AfriHuBERT, an extension of mHuBERT-147, a compact self-supervised learning (SSL) model pretrained on 147 languages. While mHuBERT-147 covered 16 African languages, we expand this to 1,226 through continued pretraining on 10K+ hours of speech data from diverse sources, benefiting an African population of over 600M. We evaluate AfriHuBERT on two key speech tasks, Spoken Language Identification (SLID) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), using the FLEURS benchmark. Our results show a +3.6% F1 score improvement for SLID and a -2.1% average Word Error Rate (WER) reduction for ASR over mHuBERT-147, and demonstrates competitiveness with larger SSL models such as MMS and XEUS. Further analysis shows that ASR models trained on AfriHuBERT exhibit improved cross-corpus generalization and are competitive in extremely low-resource ASR scenarios.

<title>Estimating Privacy Leakage of Augmented Contextual Knowledge in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) rely on their parametric knowledge augmented with relevant contextual knowledge for certain tasks, such as question answering. However, the contextual knowledge can contain private information that may be leaked when answering queries, and estimating this privacy leakage is not well understood. A straightforward approach of directly comparing an LM's output to the contexts can overestimate the privacy risk, since the LM's parametric knowledge might already contain the augmented contextual knowledge. To this end, we introduce $\emph{context influence}$, a metric that builds on differential privacy, a widely-adopted privacy notion, to estimate the privacy leakage of contextual knowledge during decoding. Our approach effectively measures how each subset of the context influences an LM's response while separating the specific parametric knowledge of the LM. Using our context influence metric, we demonstrate that context privacy leakage occurs when contextual knowledge is out of distribution with respect to parametric knowledge. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate how context influence properly attributes the privacy leakage to augmented contexts, and we evaluate how factors-- such as model size, context size, generation position, etc.-- affect context privacy leakage. The practical implications of our results will inform practitioners of the privacy risk associated with augmented contextual knowledge.

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment emphasize that AI systems should address the diverse needs of all people. Yet, efforts in this space often require sorting people into fixed buckets of pre-specified diversity-defining dimensions (e.g., demographics), risking smoothing out individualistic variations or even stereotyping. To achieve an authentic representation of diversity that respects individuality, we propose individualistic alignment. While individualistic alignment can take various forms, we introduce IndieValueCatalog, a dataset transformed from the influential World Values Survey (WVS), to study language models (LMs) on the specific challenge of individualistic value reasoning. Given a sample of an individual's value-expressing statements, models are tasked with predicting this person's value judgments in novel cases. With IndieValueCatalog, we reveal critical limitations in frontier LMs, which achieve only 55 % to 65% accuracy in predicting individualistic values. Moreover, our results highlight that a precise description of individualistic values cannot be approximated only with demographic information. We also identify a partiality of LMs in reasoning about global individualistic values, as measured by our proposed Value Inequity Index ({\sigma}Inequity). Finally, we train a series of IndieValueReasoners to reveal new patterns and dynamics into global human values.

Abstract: While personalized recommendations are often desired by users, it can be difficult in practice to distinguish cases of bias from cases of personalization: we find that models generate racially stereotypical recommendations regardless of whether the user revealed their identity intentionally through explicit indications or unintentionally through implicit cues. We demonstrate that when people use large language models (LLMs) to generate recommendations, the LLMs produce responses that reflect both what the user wants and who the user is. We argue that chatbots ought to transparently indicate when recommendations are influenced by a user's revealed identity characteristics, but observe that they currently fail to do so. Our experiments show that even though a user's revealed identity significantly influences model recommendations (p < 0.001), model responses obfuscate this fact in response to user queries. This bias and lack of transparency occurs consistently across multiple popular consumer LLMs and for four American racial groups.

Abstract: English-centric large language models (LLMs) often show strong multilingual capabilities. However, their multilingual performance remains unclear and is under-evaluated for many other languages. Most benchmarks for multilinguality focus on classic NLP tasks or cover a minimal number of languages. We introduce MEXA, a method for assessing the multilingual capabilities of pre-trained English-centric LLMs using parallel sentences, which are available for more languages than existing downstream tasks. MEXA leverages that English-centric LLMs use English as a pivot language in their intermediate layers. MEXA computes the alignment between English and non-English languages using parallel sentences to evaluate the transfer of language understanding from English to other languages. This alignment can be used to estimate model performance in different languages. We conduct controlled experiments using various parallel datasets (FLORES-200 and Bible), models (Llama family, Gemma family, Mistral, and OLMo), and established downstream tasks (Belebele, m-MMLU, and m-ARC). We explore different methods to compute embeddings in decoder-only models. Our results show that MEXA, in its default settings, achieves an average Pearson correlation of 0.90 between its predicted scores and actual task performance across languages. This suggests that MEXA is a reliable method for estimating the multilingual capabilities of English-centric LLMs, providing a clearer understanding of their multilingual potential and the inner workings of LLMs. Leaderboard: https://cis-lmu-mexa.hf.space, Code: https://github.com/cisnlp/MEXA.

<title>Optimizing the Training Schedule of Multilingual NMT using Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Multilingual NMT is a viable solution for translating low-resource languages (LRLs) when data from high-resource languages (HRLs) from the same language family is available. However, the training schedule, i.e. the order of presentation of languages, has an impact on the quality of such systems. Here, in a many-to-one translation setting, we propose to apply two algorithms that use reinforcement learning to optimize the training schedule of NMT: (1) Teacher-Student Curriculum Learning and (2) Deep Q Network. The former uses an exponentially smoothed estimate of the returns of each action based on the loss on monolingual or multilingual development subsets, while the latter estimates rewards using an additional neural network trained from the history of actions selected in different states of the system, together with the rewards received. On a 8-to-1 translation dataset with LRLs and HRLs, our second method improves BLEU and COMET scores with respect to both random selection of monolingual batches and shuffled multilingual batches, by adjusting the number of presentations of LRL vs. HRL batches.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG), while effectively integrating external knowledge to address the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be hindered by imperfect retrieval that contain irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Previous studies have rarely connected the behavior of RAG through joint analysis, particularly regarding error propagation coming from imperfect retrieval and potential conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. Through comprehensive and controlled analyses under realistic conditions, we find that imperfect retrieval augmentation is inevitable, common, and harmful. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome imperfect retrieval in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To address this, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation. It adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments with Gemini and Claude demonstrate the superior performance of Astute RAG compared to previous robustness-enhanced RAG approaches. Specifically, Astute RAG is the only RAG method that achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing conventional use of LLMs under the worst-case scenario. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of Astute RAG in resolving knowledge conflicts, thereby improving the trustworthiness of RAG.

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of commonsense level vision-knowledge conflict in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where visual information contradicts model's internal commonsense knowledge. To study this issue, we introduce an automated framework, augmented with human-in-the-loop quality control, to generate inputs designed to simulate and evaluate these conflicts in MLLMs. Using this framework, we have crafted a diagnostic benchmark consisting of 374 original images and 1,122 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs. The benchmark covers two aspects of conflict and three question types, providing a thorough assessment tool. We apply this benchmark to assess the conflict-resolution capabilities of nine representative MLLMs from various model families. Our results indicate an evident over-reliance on parametric knowledge for approximately 20% of all queries, especially among Yes-No and action-related problems. Based on these findings, we evaluate the effectiveness of existing approaches to mitigating the conflicts and compare them to our "Focus-on-Vision" prompting strategy. Despite some improvement, the vision-knowledge conflict remains unresolved and can be further scaled through our data construction framework. Our proposed framework, benchmark, and analysis contribute to the understanding and mitigation of vision-knowledge conflicts in MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose RoCoFT, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for large-scale language models (LMs) based on updating only a few rows and columns of the weight matrices in transformers. Through extensive experiments with medium-size LMs like BERT and RoBERTa, and larger LMs like Bloom-7B, Llama2-7B, and Llama2-13B, we show that our method gives comparable or better accuracies than state-of-art PEFT methods while also being more memory and computation-efficient. We also study the reason behind the effectiveness of our method with tools from neural tangent kernel theory. We empirically demonstrate that our kernel, constructed using a restricted set of row and column parameters, are numerically close to the full-parameter kernel and gives comparable classification performance. Ablation studies are conducted to investigate the impact of different algorithmic choices, including the selection strategy for rows and columns as well as the optimal rank for effective implementation of our method.

Abstract: We propose Model Swarms, a collaborative search algorithm to adapt LLMs via swarm intelligence, the collective behavior guiding individual systems. Specifically, Model Swarms starts with a pool of LLM experts and a utility function. Guided by the best-found checkpoints across models, diverse LLM experts collaboratively move in the weight space and optimize a utility function representing model adaptation objectives. Compared to existing model composition approaches, Model Swarms offers tuning-free model adaptation, works in low-data regimes with as few as 200 examples, and does not require assumptions about specific experts in the swarm or how they should be composed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Model Swarms could flexibly adapt LLM experts to a single task, multi-task domains, reward models, as well as diverse human interests, improving over 12 model composition baselines by up to 21.0% across tasks and contexts. Further analysis reveals that LLM experts discover previously unseen capabilities in initial checkpoints and that Model Swarms enable the weak-to-strong transition of experts through the collaborative search process.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive translation performance without requiring fine-tuning on additional parallel corpora. However, they still face significant challenges in certain scenarios, particularly when translating low-resource languages. A common approach to address this issue is to provide external knowledge, such as few-shot examples, to assist LLMs in translating specific source sentences. However, this method is fundamentally limited by the quality or quantity of relevant sources, which cannot always be guaranteed. To reduce LLMs' reliance on external sources, we propose BridG MT, a method that combines Sentence Bridging, which generates a sequence of sentences as a bridge that gradually transition from easy-to-translate to more difficult, and Gradual MT, which sequentially translates these sentences using earlier translations as few-shot examples for subsequent ones. Experiments conducted on four LLMs across seven languages demonstrate that our method effectively enhances translation performance, even outperforming translation methods that rely on a large number of few-shot examples.

Abstract: Model merging has become one of the key technologies for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, our understanding of the expected performance gains and principles when merging any two models remains limited. In this work, we introduce model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs, analogous to biological evolution. With comprehensive empirical analysis, we find that there is a certain relationship between model kinship and the performance gains after model merging, which can help guide our selection of candidate models. Inspired by this, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can yield better performance on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we discover that using model kinship as a criterion can assist us in continuously performing model merging, alleviating the degradation (local optima) in model evolution, whereas model kinship can serve as a guide to escape these traps.

Abstract: Faced with an expensive human annotation process, creators of NLP systems increasingly turn to synthetic data generation. While this method shows promise, the extent to which synthetic data can replace human annotation is poorly understood. We investigate the use of synthetic data in Fact Verification (FV) and Question Answering (QA) by studying the effects of incrementally replacing human generated data with synthetic points on eight diverse datasets. Strikingly, replacing up to 90% of the training data only marginally decreases performance, but replacing the final 10% leads to severe declines. We find that models trained on purely synthetic data can be reliably improved by including as few as 125 human generated data points. We show that matching the performance gain of just a little additional human data (only 200 points) requires an order of magnitude more synthetic data and estimate price ratios at which human annotation would be a more cost-effective solution. Our results suggest that even when human annotation at scale is infeasible, there is great value to having a small proportion of the dataset being human generated.

Abstract: Traditional transformer models often allocate a fixed amount of computational resources to every input token, leading to inefficient and unnecessary computation. To address this, the Mixture of Depths (MoD) was introduced to dynamically adjust the computational depth by skipping less important layers. Despite its promise, current MoD approaches remain under-explored and face two main challenges: (1) high training costs due to the need to train the entire model along with the routers that determine which layers to skip, and (2) the risk of performance degradation when important layers are bypassed. In response to the first issue, we propose Router-Tuning, a method that fine-tunes only the router on a small dataset, drastically reducing the computational overhead associated with full model training. For the second challenge, we propose MindSkip, which deploys Attention with Dynamic Depths. This method preserves the model's performance while significantly enhancing computational and memory efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers competitive results while dramatically improving the computation efficiency, e.g., 21\% speedup and only a 0.2\% performance drop. The code is released at https://github.com/CASE-Lab-UMD/Router-Tuning.

Abstract: The proliferation of transliterated texts in digital spaces has emphasized the need for detecting and classifying hate speech in languages beyond English, particularly in low-resource languages. As online discourse can perpetuate discrimination based on target groups, e.g. gender, religion, and origin, multi-label classification of hateful content can help in comprehending hate motivation and enhance content moderation. While previous efforts have focused on monolingual or binary hate classification tasks, no work has yet addressed the challenge of multi-label hate speech classification in transliterated Bangla. We introduce BanTH, the first multi-label transliterated Bangla hate speech dataset comprising 37.3k samples. The samples are sourced from YouTube comments, where each instance is labeled with one or more target groups, reflecting the regional demographic. We establish novel transformer encoder-based baselines by further pre-training on transliterated Bangla corpus. We also propose a novel translation-based LLM prompting strategy for transliterated text. Experiments reveal that our further pre-trained encoders are achieving state-of-the-art performance on the BanTH dataset, while our translation-based prompting outperforms other strategies in the zero-shot setting. The introduction of BanTH not only fills a critical gap in hate speech research for Bangla but also sets the stage for future exploration into code-mixed and multi-label classification challenges in underrepresented languages.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they still struggle with generating factually incorrect content (i.e., hallucinations). A promising approach to mitigate this issue is enabling models to express uncertainty when unsure. Previous research on uncertainty modeling has primarily focused on short-form QA, but realworld applications often require much longer responses. In this work, we introduce the task of Long-form Generation with Uncertainty(LoGU). We identify two key challenges: Uncertainty Suppression, where models hesitate to express uncertainty, and Uncertainty Misalignment, where models convey uncertainty inaccurately. To tackle these challenges, we propose a refinement-based data collection framework and a two-stage training pipeline. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, refining uncertainty based on atomic claims. The collected data are then used in training through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance uncertainty expression. Extensive experiments on three long-form instruction following datasets show that our method significantly improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and maintains the comprehensiveness of responses.

<title>Math Neurosurgery: Isolating Language Models' Math Reasoning Abilities Using Only Forward Passes</title>

Abstract: Math reasoning is an active area of Large Language Model (LLM) research because it is a hallmark of artificial intelligence and has implications in several domains, including math education. However, few works have explored how math reasoning is encoded within LLM parameters and if it is a skill that can be isolated within models. Doing so could allow targeted intervention to improve math performance without altering non-math behavior and foster understanding of how models encode math reasoning. We introduce Math Neurosurgery (MathNeuro), a computationally efficient method we use to isolate math-specific parameters in LLMs using only forward passes. MathNeuro builds on existing work by using weights and activations to calculate parameter importance, but isolates math-specific parameters by filtering out those important for general language tasks. Through pruning parameters MathNeuro identifies, we delete a LLM's math reasoning ability without significantly impacting its general language ability. Scaling the identified parameters by a small constant improves a pretrained or instruction-tuned LLM's performance by 4-17% on GSM8K and 5-35% on MATH while leaving non-math behavior unaltered. MathNeuro is also data efficient: most of its effectiveness holds when identifying math-specific parameters using a single sample. MathNeuro highlights the potential for future work to intervene on math-specific parameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance through pretraining on extensive data. This enables efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks. However, the lack of interpretability in their underlying mechanisms limits the ability to effectively steer LLMs for specific applications. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic mechanisms of LLMs from a cognitive perspective using eye movement measures. Specifically, we analyze the layer-wise correlation between human cognitive indicators and LLM representations. Building on these insights, we propose a heuristic approach for selecting the optimal steering layer to modulate LLM semantics. To this end, we introduce an efficient selective layer intervention based on prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, which conventionally adjust either all layers or only the final layer. Additionally, we present an implicit layer contrastive intervention during inference to steer LLMs away from toxic outputs. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation tasks, conducted on GPT-2, Llama2-7B, and Mistral-7B, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. As a model-agnostic framework, it enhances the interpretability of LLMs while improving efficiency for safe deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising new paradigm for text generative modeling, potentially addressing limitations of autoregressive (AR) models. However, current DLMs have been studied at a smaller scale compared to their AR counterparts and lack fair comparison on language modeling benchmarks. Additionally, training diffusion models from scratch at scale remains challenging. Given the prevalence of open-source AR language models, we propose adapting these models to build text diffusion models. We demonstrate connections between AR and diffusion modeling objectives and introduce a simple continual pre-training approach for training diffusion models. Through systematic evaluation on language modeling, reasoning, and commonsense benchmarks, we show that we can convert AR models ranging from 127M to 7B parameters (GPT2 and LLaMA) into diffusion models DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, using less than 200B tokens for training. Our experimental results reveal that these models outperform earlier DLMs and are competitive with their AR counterparts. We release a suite of DLMs (127M-355M-7B) capable of generating fluent text, performing in-context learning, filling in the middle without prompt re-ordering, and following instructions https://github.com/HKUNLP/DiffuLLaMA.

Abstract: Factuality evaluation aims to detect factual errors produced by language models (LMs) and hence guide the development of more factual models. Towards this goal, we train a factuality evaluator, FenCE, that provides LM generators with claim-level factuality feedback. We conduct data augmentation on a combination of public judgment datasets to train FenCE to (1) generate textual critiques along with scores and (2) make claim-level judgment based on diverse source documents obtained by various tools. We then present a framework that leverages FenCE to improve the factuality of LM generators by constructing training data. Specifically, we generate a set of candidate responses, leverage FenCE to revise and score each response without introducing lesser-known facts, and train the generator by preferring highly scored revised responses. Experiments show that our data augmentation methods improve the evaluator's accuracy by 2.9% on LLM-AggreFact. With FenCE, we improve Llama2-7B-chat and Llama3-8B-chat's factuality rate by 16.86% and 14.45% on FActScore, outperforming state-of-the-art factuality finetuning methods by 8.83% and 6.96%.

Abstract: We introduce GrammaMT, a grammatically-aware prompting approach for machine translation that uses Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT), a common form of linguistic description providing morphological and lexical annotations for source sentences. GrammaMT proposes three prompting strategies: gloss-shot, chain-gloss and model-gloss. All are training-free, requiring only a few examples that involve minimal effort to collect, and making them well-suited for low-resource setups. Experiments show that GrammaMT enhances translation performance on open-source instruction-tuned LLMs for various low- to high-resource languages across three benchmarks: (1) the largest IGT corpus, (2) the challenging 2023 SIGMORPHON Shared Task data over endangered languages, and (3) even in an out-of-domain setting with FLORES. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that leveraging gloss resources could substantially boost MT performance (by over 17 BLEU points) if LLMs accurately generate or access input sentence glosses.

Abstract: Learning from human feedback has enabled the alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences. However, collecting human preferences is expensive and time-consuming, with highly variable annotation quality. An appealing alternative is to distill preferences from LMs as a source of synthetic annotations, offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative, albeit susceptible to other biases and errors. In this work, we introduce HyPER, a Hybrid Preference routER that defers an annotation to either humans or LMs, achieving better annotation quality while reducing the cost of human-only annotation. We formulate this as an optimization problem: given a preference dataset and an evaluation metric, we (1) train a performance prediction model (PPM) to predict a reward model's (RM) performance on an arbitrary combination of human and LM annotations and (2) employ a routing strategy that selects a combination that maximizes the predicted performance. We train the PPM on MultiPref, a new preference dataset with 10k instances paired with humans and LM labels. We show that the selected hybrid mixture of synthetic and direct human preferences using HyPER achieves better RM performance compared to using either one exclusively by 7-13% on RewardBench and generalizes across unseen preference datasets and other base models. We also observe the same trend in other benchmarks using Best-of-N reranking, where the hybrid mix has 2-3% better performance. Finally, we analyze features from HyPER and find that prompts with moderate safety concerns or complexity benefit the most from human feedback.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose \textit{TrajAgent}, a agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In \textit{TrajAgent}, we first develop \textit{UniEnv}, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on \textit{UniEnv}, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{TrajAgent} in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38\%-34.96\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Simultaneous machine translation (SMT) takes streaming input utterances and incrementally produces target text. Existing SMT methods mainly use the partial utterance that has already arrived at the input and the generated hypothesis. Motivated by human interpreters' technique to forecast future words before hearing them, we propose $\textbf{T}$ranslation by $\textbf{A}$nticipating $\textbf{F}$uture (TAF), a method to improve translation quality while retraining low latency. Its core idea is to use a large language model (LLM) to predict future source words and opportunistically translate without introducing too much risk. We evaluate our TAF and multiple baselines of SMT on four language directions. Experiments show that TAF achieves the best translation quality-latency trade-off and outperforms the baselines by up to 5 BLEU points at the same latency (three words).

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred research into enhancing their reasoning capabilities, particularly in math-rich STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) documents. While LLMs can generate equations or solve math-related queries, their ability to fully understand and interpret abstract mathematical symbols in long, math-rich documents remains limited. In this paper, we introduce STEM-PoM, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on math symbols within contextual scientific text. The dataset, sourced from real-world ArXiv documents, contains over 2K math symbols classified as main attributes of variables, constants, operators, and unit descriptors, with additional sub-attributes including scalar/vector/matrix for variables and local/global/discipline-specific labels for both constants and operators. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve an average accuracy of 20-60% under in-context learning and 50-60% with fine-tuning, highlighting a substantial gap in their ability to classify mathematical symbols. By improving LLMs' mathematical symbol classification, STEM-PoM further enhances models' downstream mathematical reasoning capabilities. The code and data are available at https://github.com/jiaruzouu/STEM-PoM.

Abstract: Speech translation for Indian languages remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of large-scale, publicly available datasets that capture the linguistic diversity and domain coverage essential for real-world applications. Existing datasets cover a fraction of Indian languages and lack the breadth needed to train robust models that generalize beyond curated benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce BhasaAnuvaad, the largest speech translation dataset for Indian languages, spanning over 44 thousand hours of audio and 17 million aligned text segments across 14 Indian languages and English. Our dataset is built through a threefold methodology: (a) aggregating high-quality existing sources, (b) large-scale web crawling to ensure linguistic and domain diversity, and (c) creating synthetic data to model real-world speech disfluencies. Leveraging BhasaAnuvaad, we train IndicSeamless, a state-of-the-art speech translation model for Indian languages that performs better than existing models. Our experiments demonstrate improvements in the translation quality, setting a new standard for Indian language speech translation. We will release all the code, data and model weights in the open-source, with permissive licenses to promote accessibility and collaboration.

Abstract: Empirical evidence indicates that LLMs exhibit spontaneous cross-lingual alignment. However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in Information Extraction (IE), a significant imbalance across languages persists, highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X, a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal IE. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation task. Secondly, we conduct IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on the translated instance prediction task to enhance the model's cross-lingual transferability. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER, synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual annotation to ensure quality. Although without training in 29 unseen languages, KnowCoder-X surpasses ChatGPT by 30.17\% and SoTA by 20.03\%, thereby demonstrating superior cross-lingual IE capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations on 64 IE benchmarks in Chinese and English under various settings demonstrate that KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual IE transfer through boosting the IE alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capability in language generation and understanding, but their tendency to hallucinate and produce factually incorrect information remains a key limitation. To verify LLM-generated contents and claims from other sources, traditional verification approaches often rely on holistic models that assign a single factuality label to complex claims, potentially obscuring nuanced errors. In this paper, we advocate for a shift towards fine-grained verification, where complex claims are broken down into smaller sub-claims for individual verification, allowing for more precise identification of inaccuracies, improved transparency, and reduced ambiguity in evidence retrieval. However, generating sub-claims poses challenges, such as maintaining context and ensuring semantic equivalence with respect to the original claim. We introduce FactLens, a benchmark for evaluating fine-grained fact verification, with metrics and automated evaluators of sub-claim quality. The benchmark data is manually curated to ensure high-quality ground truth. Our results show alignment between automated FactLens evaluators and human judgments, and we discuss the impact of sub-claim characteristics on the overall verification performance.

Abstract: Topic modeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing, allowing the discovery of latent thematic structures in text corpora. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in topic discovery, their direct application to topic modeling suffers from issues such as incomplete topic coverage, misalignment of topics, and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-ITL, a novel LLM-in-the-loop framework that integrates LLMs with Neural Topic Models (NTMs). In LLM-ITL, global topics and document representations are learned through the NTM. Meanwhile, an LLM refines these topics using an Optimal Transport (OT)-based alignment objective, where the refinement is dynamically adjusted based on the LLM's confidence in suggesting topical words for each set of input words. With the flexibility of being integrated into many existing NTMs, the proposed approach enhances the interpretability of topics while preserving the efficiency of NTMs in learning topics and document representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM-ITL helps NTMs significantly improve their topic interpretability while maintaining the quality of document representation.

Abstract: To address the global challenge of online hate speech, prior research has developed detection models to flag such content on social media. However, due to systematic biases in evaluation datasets, the real-world effectiveness of these models remains unclear, particularly across geographies. We introduce HateDay, the first global hate speech dataset representative of social media settings, constructed from a random sample of all tweets posted on September 21, 2022 and covering eight languages and four English-speaking countries. Using HateDay, we uncover substantial variation in the prevalence and composition of hate speech across languages and regions. We show that evaluations on academic datasets greatly overestimate real-world detection performance, which we find is very low, especially for non-European languages. Our analysis identifies key drivers of this gap, including models' difficulty to distinguish hate from offensive speech and a mismatch between the target groups emphasized in academic datasets and those most frequently targeted in real-world settings. We argue that poor model performance makes public models ill-suited for automatic hate speech moderation and find that high moderation rates are only achievable with substantial human oversight. Our results underscore the need to evaluate detection systems on data that reflects the complexity and diversity of real-world social media.

Abstract: We evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) latently recall and compose facts to answer multi-hop queries like "In the year Scarlett Johansson was born, the Summer Olympics were hosted in the country of". One major challenge in such evaluation is that LLMs may have developed shortcuts by encountering the head entity "Scarlett Johansson" and the answer entity "United States" in the same training sequences or merely guess the answer based on frequency-based priors. To prevent shortcuts, we exclude test queries where the head and answer entities might have co-appeared during training. Through careful selection of relations and facts and systematic removal of cases where models might guess answers or exploit partial matches, we construct an evaluation dataset SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning). We observe that LLMs demonstrate promising latent multi-hop reasoning abilities without exploiting shortcuts, but only for certain types of queries. For queries requiring latent recall of countries as the intermediate answer, the best models achieve 80% latent composability, but this drops to just 5% for the recall of years. Comparisons with Chain-of-Thought highlight a significant gap between the ability of models to reason latently versus explicitly. Analysis reveals that latent representations of the intermediate answer are constructed more often in queries with higher latent composability, and shows the emergence of latent multi-hop reasoning during pretraining.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform downstream tasks through advanced prompting and high-quality demonstrations. However, traditional ICL paradigms encounter significant limitations in complex reasoning tasks, stemming primarily from their dependence on example quality and absence of explicit reasoning guidance. To address these challenges, we introduce HiAR-ICL, a **Hi**gh-level **A**utomated **R**easoning paradigm in **ICL** that shifts focus from specific examples to abstract reasoning patterns, thereby extending the conventional concept of "context" in ICL. Our approach begins by defining five atomic reasoning actions, upon which we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to systematically construct high-level reasoning patterns. During inference, HiAR-ICL dynamically selects appropriate reasoning patterns based on problem attributes, providing explicit guidance for the model's reasoning process. Experiments demonstrate HiAR-ICL's effectiveness and efficiency: utilizing only 200 prior samples with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, our method achieves 80.6% accuracy on MATH and 62.5% on AMC, exceeding GPT-4o's 77.2% and 57.5%. Our approach enhances performance across models of varying sizes while generalizing effectively across domains. Further analysis reveals that HiAR-ICL can also serve as a plug-and-play inference method compatible with post-training techniques like GRPO. Code and data are available at https://github.com/jinyangwu/HiARICL.

Abstract: Warning: this paper discusses content related, but not limited to, violence, sex, and suicide. Loneliness, or the lack of fulfilling relationships, significantly impacts a person's mental and physical well-being and is prevalent worldwide. Previous research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may help mitigate loneliness. However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs in services like ChatGPT is more prevalent--and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT outside of its marketed use as a task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22x more likely to be targeted than men. Our findings underscore ethical and legal questions about this technology, and note risks like radicalisation or further isolation. We conclude with recommendations to research and industry to address loneliness.

Abstract: Recent English Common Crawl datasets like FineWeb-Edu and DCLM achieved significant benchmark gains via aggressive model-based filtering, but at the cost of removing 90% of data. This limits their suitability for long token horizon training, such as 15T tokens for Llama 3.1. In this paper, we show how to achieve better trade-offs between accuracy and data quantity by a combination of classifier ensembling, synthetic data rephrasing, and reduced reliance on heuristic filters. When training 8B parameter models for 1T tokens, using a high-quality subset of our data improves MMLU by 5.6 over DCLM, demonstrating the efficacy of our methods for boosting accuracies over a relatively short token horizon. Furthermore, our full 6.3T token dataset matches DCLM on MMLU, but contains four times more unique real tokens than DCLM. This unlocks state-of-the-art training over a long token horizon: an 8B parameter model trained for 15T tokens, of which 7.2T came from our dataset, is better than the Llama 3.1 8B model: +5 on MMLU, +3.1 on ARC-Challenge, and +0.5 on average across ten diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been well-researched in various long-context tasks. However, the scarcity of long-context summarization datasets hinders progress in this area. To address this, we introduce CNNSum, a multi-scale long-context summarization benchmark based on Chinese novels, featuring human-driven annotations across four subsets totaling 695 samples, with lengths ranging from 16k to 128k. We benchmark numerous LLMs and conduct detailed human assessments to summarize abnormal output types. Furthermore, we extensively explore how to improve long-context summarization. In our study: (1) Advanced LLMs may generate much subjective commentary, leading to vague summaries. (2) Currently, long-context summarization mainly relies on memory ability. The advantages of Large LLMs are hard to utilize, thus small LLMs are more cost-effective. (3) Different prompt types paired with various version models may cause large performance gaps. In further fine-tuning, these can be mitigated, and the Base version models perform better. (4) LLMs with RoPE-base scaled exhibit strong extrapolation potential; using short-context data can significantly improve long-context summarization performance. However, further applying other interpolation methods requires careful selection. (5) CNNSum provides more reliable evaluation results than other benchmarks. We release CNNSum to advance future research.(https://github.com/CxsGhost/CNNSum)

Abstract: This work introduces RARE (Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement), a versatile extension to the mutual reasoning framework (rStar), aimed at enhancing reasoning accuracy and factual integrity across large language models (LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks such as commonsense and medical reasoning. RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive few-shot learning capabilities through in-context learning (ICL). However, ICL performance is highly dependent on the choice of few-shot demonstrations, making the selection of the most optimal examples a persistent research challenge. This issue is further amplified in low-resource Indic languages, where the scarcity of ground-truth data complicates the selection process. In this work, we propose PromptRefine, a novel Alternating Minimization approach for example selection that improves ICL performance on low-resource Indic languages. PromptRefine leverages auxiliary example banks from related high-resource Indic languages and employs multi-task learning techniques to align language-specific retrievers, enabling effective cross-language retrieval. Additionally, we incorporate diversity in the selected examples to enhance generalization and reduce bias. Through comprehensive evaluations on four text generation tasks -- Cross-Lingual Question Answering, Multilingual Question Answering, Machine Translation, and Cross-Lingual Summarization using state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLAMA-3.1-8B, LLAMA-2-7B, Qwen-2-7B, and Qwen-2.5-7B, we demonstrate that PromptRefine significantly outperforms existing frameworks for retrieving examples.

Abstract: In this work, we compare the domain-specific translation performance of open-source autoregressive decoder-only large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented machine translation (MT) models. Our experiments focus on the medical domain and cover four language directions with varied resource availability: English-to-French, English-to-Portuguese, English-to-Swahili, and Swahili-to-English. Despite recent advancements, LLMs demonstrate a significant quality gap in specialized translation compared to multilingual encoder-decoder MT models such as NLLB-200. Our results indicate that NLLB-200 3.3B outperforms all evaluated LLMs in the 7-8B parameter range across three out of the four language directions. While fine-tuning improves the performance of LLMs such as Mistral and Llama, these models still underperform compared to fine-tuned NLLB-200 3.3B models. Our findings highlight the ongoing need for specialized MT models to achieve high-quality domain-specific translation, especially in medium-resource and low-resource settings. Moreover, the superior performance of larger LLMs over their 8B variants suggests potential value in pre-training domain-specific medium-sized language models, employing targeted data selection and knowledge distillation approaches to enhance both quality and efficiency in specialized translation tasks.

<title>KnowShiftQA: How Robust are RAG Systems when Textbook Knowledge Shifts in K-12 Education?</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show remarkable potential as question answering tools in the K-12 Education domain, where knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative textbooks. However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.

<title>On the Limit of Language Models as Planning Formalizers</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models have been found to create plans that are neither executable nor verifiable in grounded environments. An emerging line of work demonstrates success in using the LLM as a formalizer to generate a formal representation of the planning domain in some language, such as Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). This formal representation can be deterministically solved to find a plan. We systematically evaluate this methodology while bridging some major gaps. While previous work only generates a partial PDDL representation, given templated, and therefore unrealistic environment descriptions, we generate the complete representation given descriptions of various naturalness levels. Among an array of observations critical to improve LLMs' formal planning abilities, we note that most large enough models can effectively formalize descriptions as PDDL, outperforming those directly generating plans, while being robust to lexical perturbation. As the descriptions become more natural-sounding, we observe a decrease in performance and provide detailed error analysis.

Abstract: We introduce LLM-as-an-Interviewer, a novel paradigm for evaluating large language models (LLMs). This approach leverages multi-turn interactions where the LLM interviewer actively provides feedback on responses and poses follow-up questions to the evaluated LLM. At the start of the interview, the LLM interviewer dynamically modifies datasets to generate initial questions, mitigating data contamination. We apply the LLM-as-an-Interviewer framework to evaluate six models on the MATH and DepthQA tasks. Our results show that the framework effectively provides insights into LLM performance, including the quality of initial responses, adaptability to feedback, and ability to address follow-up queries like clarification or additional knowledge requests. The framework also addresses key limitations of conventional methods like LLM-as-a-Judge, including verbosity bias and inconsistency across runs. Finally, we propose the Interview Report, which aggregates insights from the interview process, providing examples and a comprehensive analysis of the LLM's strengths and weaknesses. This report offers a detailed snapshot of the model's real-world applicability. The code for our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/interview-eval/.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at answering questions but remain passive learners-absorbing static data without the ability to question and refine knowledge. This paper explores how LLMs can transition to interactive, question-driven learning through student-teacher dialogues. We introduce INTERACT (INTERactive learning for Adaptive Concept Transfer), a framework in which a "student" LLM engages a "teacher" LLM through iterative inquiries to acquire knowledge across 1,347 contexts, including song lyrics, news articles, movie plots, academic papers, and images. Our experiments show that across a wide range of scenarios and LLM architectures, interactive learning consistently enhances performance, achieving up to a 25% improvement, with 'cold-start' student models matching static learning baselines in as few as five dialogue turns. Interactive setups can also mitigate the disadvantages of weaker teachers, showcasing the robustness of question-driven learning.

<title>The Impact of Token Granularity on the Predictive Power of Language Model Surprisal</title>

Abstract: Word-by-word language model surprisal is often used to model the incremental processing of human readers, which raises questions about how various choices in language modeling influence its predictive power. One factor that has been overlooked in cognitive modeling is the granularity of subword tokens, which explicitly encodes information about word length and frequency, and ultimately influences the quality of vector representations that are learned. This paper presents experiments that manipulate the token granularity and evaluate its impact on the ability of surprisal to account for processing difficulty of naturalistic text and garden-path constructions. Experiments with naturalistic reading times reveal a substantial influence of token granularity on surprisal, with tokens defined by a vocabulary size of 8,000 resulting in surprisal that is most predictive. In contrast, on garden-path constructions, language models trained on coarser-grained tokens generally assigned higher surprisal to critical regions, suggesting a greater sensitivity to garden-path effects than previously reported. Taken together, these results suggest a large role of token granularity on the quality of language model surprisal for cognitive modeling.

Abstract: Attention heads are one of the building blocks of large language models (LLMs). Prior work on investigating their operation mostly focused on analyzing their behavior during inference for specific circuits or tasks. In this work, we seek a comprehensive mapping of the operations they implement in a model. We propose MAPS (Mapping Attention head ParameterS), an efficient framework that infers the functionality of attention heads from their parameters, without any model training or inference. We showcase the utility of MAPS for answering two types of questions: (a) given a predefined operation, mapping how strongly heads across the model implement it, and (b) given an attention head, inferring its salient functionality. Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head's outputs during inference and are causally linked to the model's predictions. Moreover, its mappings reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in previous studies, and valuable insights on function universality and architecture biases in LLMs. Next, we present an automatic pipeline and analysis that leverage MAPS to characterize the salient operations of a given head. Our pipeline produces plausible operation descriptions for most heads, as assessed by human judgment, while revealing diverse operations.

Abstract: Autoregressive transformers exhibit adaptive learning through in-context learning (ICL), which begs the question of how. Prior works have shown that transformers represent the ICL tasks as vectors in their representations. In this paper, we leverage the encoding-decoding framework to study how transformers form task vectors during pretraining and how their task encoding quality predicts ICL task performance. On synthetic ICL tasks, we analyze the training dynamics of a small transformer and report the coupled emergence of task encoding and decoding. As the model learns to encode different latent tasks (e.g., "Finding the first noun in a sentence.") into distinct, separable representations, it concurrently builds conditional decoding algorithms and improves its ICL performance. We validate this phenomenon across pretrained models of varying scales (Gemma-2 2B/9B/27B, Llama-3.1 8B/70B) and over the course of pretraining in OLMo-7B. Further, we demonstrate that the quality of task encoding inferred from representations predicts ICL performance, and that, surprisingly, finetuning the earlier layers can improve the task encoding and performance more than finetuning the latter layers. Our empirical insights shed light into better understanding the success and failure modes of large language models via their representations.

Abstract: Lexical semantic change detection aims to identify shifts in word meanings over time. While existing methods using embeddings from a diachronic corpus pair estimate the degree of change for target words, they offer limited insight into changes at the level of individual usage instances. To address this, we apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) to sets of contextualized word embeddings, capturing semantic change through the excess and deficit in the alignment between usage instances. In particular, we propose Sense Usage Shift (SUS), a measure that quantifies changes in the usage frequency of a word sense at each usage instance. By leveraging SUS, we demonstrate that several challenges in semantic change detection can be addressed in a unified manner, including quantifying instance-level semantic change and word-level tasks such as measuring the magnitude of semantic change and the broadening or narrowing of meaning.

Abstract: In recent research, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to investigate public opinions. This study investigates the algorithmic fidelity of LLMs, i.e., the ability to replicate the socio-cultural context and nuanced opinions of human participants. Using open-ended survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Studies (GLES), we prompt different LLMs to generate synthetic public opinions reflective of German subpopulations by incorporating demographic features into the persona prompts. Our results show that Llama performs better than other LLMs at representing subpopulations, particularly when there is lower opinion diversity within those groups. Our findings further reveal that the LLM performs better for supporters of left-leaning parties like The Greens and The Left compared to other parties, and matches the least with the right-party AfD. Additionally, the inclusion or exclusion of specific variables in the prompts can significantly impact the models' predictions. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLMs to more effectively model diverse public opinions while minimizing political biases and enhancing robustness in representativeness.

Abstract: Detecting factual inconsistencies in summarization is critical, yet existing benchmarks lack the necessary challenge and interpretability for robust evaluation. In this paper, we introduce SummExecEdit, a novel pipeline and benchmark leveraging executable edits to assess models on their ability to both detect factual errors and provide accurate explanations. The top-performing model, Claude3-Opus, achieves a joint detection and explanation score of only 0.49 in our benchmark, with individual scores of 0.67 for detection and 0.73 for explanation. We conduct detailed evaluations to assess the current state of models in this field and find that more than half of the 20+ LLMs in our study struggle with over 30% of the SummExecEdit benchmark. Additionally, we identify four primary types of explanation errors, with 45.4% of them involving a focus on completely unrelated parts of the summary.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that demand complex reasoning. To track progress, robust benchmarks are required to evaluate their capabilities beyond superficial pattern recognition. However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks often face challenges such as insufficient interpretability, performance saturation or data contamination. To address these challenges, we introduce GAMEBoT, a gaming arena designed for rigorous and transparent assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities. GAMEBoT decomposes complex reasoning in games into predefined modular subproblems. This decomposition allows us to design a suite of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that leverage domain knowledge to guide LLMs in addressing these subproblems before action selection. Furthermore, we develop a suite of rule-based algorithms to generate ground truth for these subproblems, enabling rigorous validation of the LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps. This approach facilitates evaluation of both the quality of final actions and the accuracy of the underlying reasoning process. GAMEBoT also naturally alleviates the risk of data contamination through dynamic games and head-to-head LLM competitions. We benchmark 17 prominent LLMs across eight games, encompassing various strategic abilities and game characteristics. Our results suggest that GAMEBoT presents a significant challenge, even when LLMs are provided with detailed CoT prompts. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/gamebot

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache has become a bottleneck of LLMs for long-context generation. Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and generalization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other prefill-only KV compression methods.

Abstract: Recent generative large language models (LLMs) show remarkable performance in non-English languages, but when prompted in those languages they tend to express higher harmful social biases and toxicity levels. Prior work has shown that finetuning on specialized datasets can mitigate this behavior, and doing so in English can transfer to other languages. In this work, we investigate the impact of different finetuning methods on the model's bias and toxicity, but also on its ability to produce fluent and diverse text. We reduce biases by finetuning on curated non-harmful text, but find only direct preference optimization to be effective for mitigating toxicity. The mitigation caused by applying these methods in English also transfers to non-English languages. We find evidence that the extent to which transfer takes place can be predicted by the amount of data in a given language present in the model's pretraining data. However, this transfer of bias and toxicity mitigation often comes at the expense of decreased language generation ability in non-English languages, highlighting the importance of developing language-specific bias and toxicity mitigation methods.

Abstract: While feed-forward neurons in pre-trained language models (PLMs) can encode knowledge, past research targeted a small subset of neurons that heavily influence outputs. This leaves the broader role of neuron activations unclear, limiting progress in areas like knowledge editing. We uncover a global linear relationship between neuron activations and outputs using neuron interventions on a knowledge probing dataset. The gradient of this linear relationship, which we call the neuron empirical gradient (NEG), captures how changes in activations affect predictions. To compute NEG efficiently, we propose NeurGrad, enabling large-scale analysis of neuron behavior in PLMs. We also show that NEG effectively captures language skills across diverse prompts through skill neuron probing. Experiments on MCEval8k, a multi-genre multiple-choice knowledge benchmark, support NEG's ability to represent model knowledge. Further analysis highlights the key properties of NEG-based skill representation: efficiency, robustness, flexibility, and interdependency. The code and data are released.

Abstract: Large language models can generate factually inaccurate content, a problem known as hallucination. Recent works have built upon retrieved-augmented generation to improve factuality through iterative prompting but these methods are limited by the traditional RAG design. To address these challenges, we introduce EWE (Explicit Working Memory), a novel approach that enhances factuality in long-form text generation by integrating a working memory that receives real-time feedback from external resources. The memory is refreshed based on online fact-checking and retrieval feedback, allowing EWE to rectify false claims during the generation process and ensure more accurate and reliable outputs. Our experiments demonstrate that Ewe outperforms strong baselines on four fact-seeking long-form generation datasets, increasing the factuality metric, VeriScore, by 2 to 6 points absolute without sacrificing the helpfulness of the responses. Further analysis reveals that the design of rules for memory updates, configurations of memory units, and the quality of the retrieval datastore are crucial factors for influencing model performance.

While applying these tasks is often straightforward, interpreting their results can be challenging. In particular, when a model underperforms, it is often unclear whether this results from a limitation in the cognitive ability being tested or a failure to understand the task itself. A recent study argues that GPT 3.5's declining performance on 2-back and 3-back tasks reflects a working memory capacity limit similar to humans (Gong et al., 2024). By analyzing a range of open-source language models of varying performance levels on these tasks, we show that the poor performance is due at least in part to a limitation in task comprehension and task set maintenance. We challenge the best-performing model with progressively harder versions of the task (up to 10-back) and experiment with alternative prompting strategies, before analyzing model attentions. Our larger aim is to contribute to the ongoing conversation around refining methodologies for the cognitive evaluation of language models.

Abstract: Multiword expressions (MWEs) refer to idiomatic sequences of multiple words. MWE identification, i.e., detecting MWEs in text, can play a key role in downstream tasks such as machine translation, but existing datasets for the task are inconsistently annotated, limited to a single type of MWE, or limited in size. To enable reliable and comprehensive evaluation, we created CoAM: Corpus of All-Type Multiword Expressions, a dataset of 1.3K sentences constructed through a multi-step process to enhance data quality consisting of human annotation, human review, and automated consistency checking. Additionally, for the first time in a dataset of MWE identification, CoAM's MWEs are tagged with MWE types, such as Noun and Verb, enabling fine-grained error analysis. Annotations for CoAM were collected using a new interface created with our interface generator, which allows easy and flexible annotation of MWEs in any form. Through experiments using CoAM, we find that a fine-tuned large language model outperforms MWEasWSD, which achieved the state-of-the-art performance on the DiMSUM dataset. Furthermore, analysis using our MWE type tagged data reveals that Verb MWEs are easier than Noun MWEs to identify across approaches.

Abstract: Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the number of reasoning tokens based on the reasoning complexity of each problem. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

<title>"My life is miserable, have to sign 500 autographs everyday": Exposing Humblebragging, the Brags in Disguise</title>

Abstract: Humblebragging is a phenomenon in which individuals present self-promotional statements under the guise of modesty or complaints. For example, a statement like, "Ugh, I can't believe I got promoted to lead the entire team. So stressful!", subtly highlights an achievement while pretending to be complaining. Detecting humblebragging is important for machines to better understand the nuances of human language, especially in tasks like sentiment analysis and intent recognition. However, this topic has not yet been studied in computational linguistics. For the first time, we introduce the task of automatically detecting humblebragging in text. We formalize the task by proposing a 4-tuple definition of humblebragging and evaluate machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) on this task, comparing their performance with humans. We also create and release a dataset called HB-24, containing 3,340 humblebrags generated using GPT-4o. Our experiments show that detecting humblebragging is non-trivial, even for humans. Our best model achieves an F1-score of 0.88. This work lays the foundation for further exploration of this nuanced linguistic phenomenon and its integration into broader natural language understanding systems.

Abstract: No-resource languages - those with minimal or no digital representation - pose unique challenges for machine translation (MT). Unlike low-resource languages, which rely on limited but existent corpora, no-resource languages often have fewer than 100 sentences available for training. This work explores the problem of no-resource translation through three distinct workflows: fine-tuning of translation-specific models, in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) using chain-of-reasoning prompting, and direct prompting without reasoning. Using Owens Valley Paiute as a case study, we demonstrate that no-resource translation demands fundamentally different approaches from low-resource scenarios, as traditional approaches to machine translation, such as those that work for low-resource languages, fail. Empirical results reveal that, although traditional approaches fail, the in-context learning capabilities of general-purpose large language models enable no-resource language translation that outperforms low-resource translation approaches and rivals human translations (BLEU 0.45-0.6); specifically, chain-of-reasoning prompting outperforms other methods for larger corpora, while direct prompting exhibits advantages in smaller datasets. As these approaches are language-agnostic, they have potential to be generalized to translation tasks from a wide variety of no-resource languages without expert input. These findings establish no-resource translation as a distinct paradigm requiring innovative solutions, providing practical and theoretical insights for language preservation.

Abstract: Transformers, as the fundamental deep learning architecture, have demonstrated great capability in reasoning. This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers' capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers outperform previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on the reasoning capability of transformers. Interestingly, our results revealed the mismatch of positional encoding and other design choices of transformer architectures in previous practices. Motivated by this, we propose TEGA, a logic-aware architecture that significantly improves the performance in generalizable first-order logical entailment.

Abstract: In psychological practices, standardized questionnaires serve as essential tools for assessing mental health through structured, clinically-validated questions (i.e., items). While social media platforms offer rich data for mental health screening, computational approaches often bypass these established clinical assessment tools in favor of black-box classification. We propose a novel questionnaire-guided screening framework that bridges psychological practice and computational methods through adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (\textit{aRAG}). Our approach links unstructured social media content and standardized clinical assessments by retrieving relevant posts for each questionnaire item and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to complete validated psychological instruments. Our findings demonstrate two key advantages of questionnaire-guided screening: First, when completing the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance on Reddit-based benchmarks without requiring training data. Second, we show that guiding LLMs through standardized questionnaires can yield superior results compared to directly prompting them for depression screening, while also providing a more interpretable assessment by linking model outputs to clinically validated diagnostic criteria. Additionally, we show, as a proof-of-concept, how our questionnaire-based methodology can be extended to other mental conditions' screening, highlighting the promising role of LLMs as psychological assessors.

Abstract: Existing Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs), encapsulating extensive medical knowledge, demonstrate excellent capabilities in understanding medical images. However, there remain challenges in visual localization in medical images, which is crucial for abnormality detection and interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a novel UMed-LVLM designed to unveil medical abnormalities. Specifically, we collect a Medical Abnormalities Unveiling (MAU) dataset and propose a two-stage training method for UMed-LVLM training. To collect MAU dataset, we propose a prompt method utilizing the GPT-4V to generate diagnoses based on identified abnormal areas in medical images. Moreover, the two-stage training method includes Abnormal-Aware Instruction Tuning and Abnormal-Aware Rewarding, comprising Relevance Reward, Abnormal Localization Reward and Vision Relevance Reward. Experimental results demonstrate that our UMed-LVLM significantly outperforms existing Med-LVLMs in identifying and understanding medical abnormalities, achieving a 58% improvement over the baseline. In addition, this work shows that enhancing the abnormality detection capabilities of Med-LVLMs significantly improves their understanding of medical images and generalization capability.

Abstract: Interpreting the law is always essential for the law to adapt to the ever-changing society. It is a critical and challenging task even for legal practitioners, as it requires meticulous and professional annotations and summarizations by legal experts, which are admittedly time-consuming and expensive to collect at scale. To alleviate the burden on legal experts, we propose a method for automated legal interpretation. Specifically, by emulating doctrinal legal research, we introduce a novel framework, ATRIE, to address Legal Concept Interpretation, a typical task in legal interpretation. ATRIE utilizes large language models (LLMs) to AuTomatically Retrieve concept-related information, Interpret legal concepts, and Evaluate generated interpretations, eliminating dependence on legal experts. ATRIE comprises a legal concept interpreter and a legal concept interpretation evaluator. The interpreter uses LLMs to retrieve relevant information from previous cases and interpret legal concepts. The evaluator uses performance changes on Legal Concept Entailment, a downstream task we propose, as a proxy of interpretation quality. Automated and multifaceted human evaluations indicate that the quality of our interpretations is comparable to those written by legal experts, with superior comprehensiveness and readability. Although there remains a slight gap in accuracy, it can already assist legal practitioners in improving the efficiency of legal interpretation.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve, their ability to deliver personalized and context-aware responses offers transformative potential for improving user experiences. Existing personalization approaches, however, often rely solely on user history to augment the prompt, limiting their effectiveness in generating tailored outputs, especially in cold-start scenarios with sparse data. To address these limitations, we propose Personalized Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PGraphRAG), a framework that leverages user-centric knowledge graphs to enrich personalization. By directly integrating structured user knowledge into the retrieval process and augmenting prompts with user-relevant context, PGraphRAG enhances contextual understanding and output quality. We also introduce the Personalized Graph-based Benchmark for Text Generation, designed to evaluate personalized text generation tasks in real-world settings where user history is sparse or unavailable. Experimental results show that PGraphRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalization methods across diverse tasks, demonstrating the unique advantages of graph-based retrieval for personalization.

<title>Explicit vs. Implicit: Investigating Social Bias in Large Language Models through Self-Reflection</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit various biases and stereotypes in their generated content. While extensive research has investigated biases in LLMs, prior work has predominantly focused on explicit bias, with minimal attention to implicit bias and the relation between these two forms of bias. This paper presents a systematic framework grounded in social psychology theories to investigate and compare explicit and implicit biases in LLMs. We propose a novel self-reflection-based evaluation framework that operates in two phases: first measuring implicit bias through simulated psychological assessment methods, then evaluating explicit bias by prompting LLMs to analyze their own generated content. Through extensive experiments on advanced LLMs across multiple social dimensions, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a substantial inconsistency between explicit and implicit biases: while explicit bias manifests as mild stereotypes, implicit bias exhibits strong stereotypes. We further investigate the underlying factors contributing to this explicit-implicit bias inconsistency, examining the effects of training data scale, model size, and alignment techniques. Experimental results indicate that while explicit bias declines with increased training data and model size, implicit bias exhibits a contrasting upward trend. Moreover, contemporary alignment methods effectively suppress explicit bias but show limited efficacy in mitigating implicit bias.

Abstract: Large language models hold promise for addressing medical challenges, such as medical diagnosis reasoning, research knowledge acquisition, clinical decision-making, and consumer health inquiry support. However, they often generate hallucinations due to limited medical knowledge. Incorporating external knowledge is therefore critical, which necessitates multi-source knowledge acquisition. We address this challenge by framing it as a source planning problem, which is to formulate context-appropriate queries tailored to the attributes of diverse sources. Existing approaches either overlook source planning or fail to achieve it effectively due to misalignment between the model's expectation of the sources and their actual content. To bridge this gap, we present MedOmniKB, a repository comprising multigenre and multi-structured medical knowledge sources. Leveraging these sources, we propose the Source Planning Optimisation method, which enhances multi-source utilisation. Our approach involves enabling an expert model to explore and evaluate potential plans while training a smaller model to learn source alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves multi-source planning performance, enabling the optimised small model to achieve state-of-the-art results in leveraging diverse medical knowledge sources.

Abstract: This paper presents ICAT, an evaluation framework for measuring coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text generation. ICAT breaks down a long output text into a list of atomic claims and not only verifies each claim through retrieval from a (reliable) knowledge source, but also computes the alignment between the atomic factual claims and various aspects expected to be presented in the output. We study three implementations of the ICAT framework, each with a different assumption on the availability of aspects and alignment method. By adopting data from the diversification task in the TREC Web Track and the ClueWeb corpus, we evaluate the ICAT framework. We demonstrate strong correlation with human judgments and provide comprehensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our framework further offers interpretable and fine-grained analysis of diversity and coverage. Its modular design allows for easy adaptation to different domains and datasets, making it a valuable tool for evaluating the qualitative aspects of long-form responses produced by LLMs.

Abstract: Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying attribute values from product profiles, a key task for improving product search, recommendation, and business analytics on e-commerce platforms. However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as inferring implicit values, handling out-of-distribution (OOD) values, and producing normalized outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Taxonomy-Aware Contrastive Learning Retrieval (TACLR), the first retrieval-based method for PAVI. TACLR formulates PAVI as an information retrieval task by encoding product profiles and candidate values into embeddings and retrieving values based on their similarity. It leverages contrastive training with taxonomy-aware hard negative sampling and employs adaptive inference with dynamic thresholds. TACLR offers three key advantages: (1) it effectively handles implicit and OOD values while producing normalized outputs; (2) it scales to thousands of categories, tens of thousands of attributes, and millions of values; and (3) it supports efficient inference for high-load industrial deployment. Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TACLR. Further, it has been successfully deployed on the real-world e-commerce platform Xianyu, processing millions of product listings daily with frequently updated, large-scale attribute taxonomies. We release the code to facilitate reproducibility and future research at https://github.com/SuYindu/TACLR.

Abstract: It is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions that involve multiple constraints. However, it is an unexplored area to enhance LLMs' ability to follow soft constraints. To bridge the gap, we initially design a pipeline to construct datasets with high-quality outputs automatically. Additionally, to fully utilize the positive and negative samples generated during the data construction process, we choose Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as the training method. Furthermore, taking into account the difficulty of soft constraints indicated by the number of constraints, we design a curriculum learning training paradigm based on the constraint quantity. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our methods in improving LLMs' soft constraint following ability and analyze the factors driving the improvements.The datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Rainier-rq/FollowSoftConstraint.

Abstract: Background: Deception detection through analysing language is a promising avenue using both human judgments and automated machine learning judgments. For both forms of credibility assessment, automated adversarial attacks that rewrite deceptive statements to appear truthful pose a serious threat. Methods: We used a dataset of 243 truthful and 262 fabricated autobiographical stories in a deception detection task for humans and machine learning models. A large language model was tasked to rewrite deceptive statements so that they appear truthful. In Study 1, humans who made a deception judgment or used the detailedness heuristic and two machine learning models (a fine-tuned language model and a simple n-gram model) judged original or adversarial modifications of deceptive statements. In Study 2, we manipulated the target alignment of the modifications, i.e. tailoring the attack to whether the statements would be assessed by humans or computer models. Results: When adversarial modifications were aligned with their target, human (d=-0.07 and d=-0.04) and machine judgments (51% accuracy) dropped to the chance level. When the attack was not aligned with the target, both human heuristics judgments (d=0.30 and d=0.36) and machine learning predictions (63-78%) were significantly better than chance. Conclusions: Easily accessible language models can effectively help anyone fake deception detection efforts both by humans and machine learning models. Robustness against adversarial modifications for humans and machines depends on that target alignment. We close with suggestions on advancing deception research with adversarial attack designs and techniques.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, but often at the cost of reduced output diversity. This trade-off between diversity and alignment quality remains a significant challenge. Drawing inspiration from curiosity-driven exploration in reinforcement learning, we introduce curiosity-driven RLHF (CD-RLHF), a framework that incorporates intrinsic rewards for novel states, alongside traditional sparse extrinsic rewards, to optimize both output diversity and alignment quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CD-RLHF through extensive experiments on a range of tasks, including text summarization and instruction following. Our approach achieves significant gains in diversity on multiple diversity-oriented metrics while maintaining alignment with human preferences comparable to standard RLHF. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/ernie-research/CD-RLHF.

Abstract: LLMs are aligned to follow input instructions by learning which of two responses users prefer for a prompt. However, such preference data do not convey why users prefer responses that are chosen or rejected, so LLMs trained on these datasets cannot tailor responses to varied user needs. To surface these parameters of personalization, we apply abductive reasoning to preference data, inferring needs and interests of users, i.e., personas, that may prefer either response. We test this idea in two steps: Persona Inference (PI), abductively inferring personas of users who prefer chosen or rejected outputs, and Persona Tailoring (PT), training models to tailor outputs to personas from PI. We show: 1) LLMs infer personas accurately explaining why different users may prefer both chosen or rejected outputs; 2) Training on preference data augmented with PI personas via PT boosts personalization and generalizes to supporting user-written personas; and 3) Rejected response personas form harder personalization evaluations, showing PT better aids users with uncommon preferences versus typical alignment methods. We argue for an abductive view of preferences for personalization, asking not only which response is better but when, why, and for whom.

Abstract: In designing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in education, creating plausible distractors is crucial for identifying students' misconceptions and gaps in knowledge and accurately assessing their understanding. However, prior studies on distractor generation have not paid sufficient attention to enhancing the difficulty of distractors, resulting in reduced effectiveness of MCQs. This study presents a pipeline for training a model to generate distractors that are more likely to be selected by students. First, we train a pairwise ranker to reason about students' misconceptions and assess the relative plausibility of two distractors. Using this model, we create a dataset of pairwise distractor ranks and then train a distractor generator via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate more plausible distractors. Experiments on computer science subjects (Python, DB, MLDL) demonstrate that our pairwise ranker effectively identifies students' potential misunderstandings and achieves ranking accuracy comparable to human experts. Furthermore, our distractor generator outperforms several baselines in generating plausible distractors and produces questions with a higher item discrimination index (DI).

Abstract: Evaluating personalized text generated by large language models (LLMs) is challenging, as only the LLM user, i.e., prompt author, can reliably assess the output, but re-engaging the same individuals across studies is infeasible. This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating personalized text generation by introducing ExPerT, an explainable reference-based evaluation framework. ExPerT leverages an LLM to extract atomic aspects and their evidence from the generated and reference texts, match the aspects, and evaluate their alignment based on content and writing style -- two key attributes in personalized text generation. Additionally, ExPerT generates detailed, fine-grained explanations for every step of the evaluation process, enhancing transparency and interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that ExPerT achieves a 7.2% relative improvement in alignment with human judgments compared to the state-of-the-art text generation evaluation methods. Furthermore, human evaluators rated the usability of ExPerT's explanations at 4.7 out of 5, highlighting its effectiveness in making evaluation decisions more interpretable.

To bridge this gap, we present a value-driven method for training emotional support dialogue systems designed to reinforce positive values in seekers. Notably, our model identifies which values to reinforce at each turn and how to do so, by leveraging online support conversations from Reddit. We evaluate the method across support skills, seekers' emotional intensity, and value reinforcement. Our method consistently outperforms various baselines, effectively exploring and eliciting values from seekers. Additionally, leveraging crowd knowledge from Reddit significantly enhances its effectiveness. Therapists highlighted its ability to validate seekers' challenges and emphasize positive aspects of their situations$\unicode{x2013}$both crucial elements of value reinforcement. Our work, being the first to integrate value reinforcement into emotional support systems, demonstrates its promise and establishes a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Human evaluation is the gold standard for evaluating text generation models. However, it is expensive. In order to fit budgetary constraints, a random subset of the test data is often chosen in practice for human evaluation. However, randomly selected data may not accurately represent test performance, making this approach economically inefficient for model comparison. Thus, in this work, we develop and analyze a suite of selectors to get the most informative datapoints for human evaluation, taking the evaluation costs into account. We show that selectors based on variance in automated metric scores, diversity in model outputs, or Item Response Theory outperform random selection. We further develop an approach to distill these selectors to the scenario where the model outputs are not yet available. In particular, we introduce source-based estimators, which predict item usefulness for human evaluation just based on the source texts. We demonstrate the efficacy of our selectors in two common NLG tasks, machine translation and summarization, and show that only $\sim$70\% of the test data is needed to produce the same evaluation result as the entire data.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable advancements in integrating different modalities, excelling in complex understanding and generation tasks. Despite their success, MLLMs remain vulnerable to conversational adversarial inputs, particularly negation arguments. This paper systematically evaluates state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse benchmarks, revealing significant performance drops when negation arguments are introduced to initially correct responses. Notably, we introduce the first benchmark GaslightingBench, specifically designed to evaluate the vulnerability of MLLMs to negation arguments. GaslightingBench consists of multiple-choice questions curated from existing datasets, along with generated negation prompts across 20 diverse categories. Throughout extensive evaluation, we find that proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrate better resilience compared to open-source counterparts like Qwen2-VL and LLaVA. However, all evaluated MLLMs struggle to maintain logical consistency under negation arguments during conversation. Our findings provide critical insights for improving the robustness of MLLMs against negation inputs, contributing to the development of more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Recent studies have shown that increasing test-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This typically involves extensive sampling at inference time guided by an external LLM verifier, resulting in a two-player system. Despite external guidance, the effectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to tackle complex tasks. Thus, we pose a new research problem: Can we internalize the searching capabilities to fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of a single LLM? This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on post-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning process with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies). To achieve this, we propose the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm: 1) a small-scale format tuning stage to internalize the COAT reasoning format and 2) a large-scale self-improvement stage leveraging reinforcement learning. Our approach results in Satori, a 7B LLM trained on open-source models and data. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Satori achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Code, data, and models are fully open-sourced.

Abstract: The autoregressive decoding for text generation in large language models (LLMs), while widely used, is inherently suboptimal due to the lack of a built-in mechanism to perform refinement and/or correction of the generated content. In this paper, we consider optimality in terms of the joint probability over the generated response, when jointly considering all tokens at the same time. We theoretically characterize the potential deviation of the autoregressively generated response from its globally optimal counterpart that is of the same length. Our analysis suggests that we need to be cautious when noticeable uncertainty arises during text generation, which may signal the sub-optimality of the generation history. To address the pitfall of autoregressive decoding for text generation, we propose an approach that incorporates a sliding reflection window and a pausing criterion, such that refinement and generation can be carried out interchangeably as the decoding proceeds. Our selective refinement framework strikes a balance between efficiency and optimality, and our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Large language models possess general linguistic abilities but acquire language less efficiently than humans. This study proposes a method for integrating the developmental characteristics of working memory during the critical period, a stage when human language acquisition is particularly efficient, into the training process of language models. The proposed method introduces a mechanism that initially constrains working memory during the early stages of training and gradually relaxes this constraint in an exponential manner as learning progresses. Targeted syntactic evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods without memory constraints or with static memory constraints. These findings not only provide new directions for designing data-efficient language models but also offer indirect evidence supporting the role of the developmental characteristics of working memory as the underlying mechanism of the critical period in language acquisition.

Abstract: Recent reasoning models, such as OpenAI's O1 series, have demonstrated exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks and revealed new test-time scaling laws. Inspired by this, many people have been studying how to train models to achieve effective self-evaluation and self-correction to further enable the scaling paradigm. However, less studied is how to efficiently scale test-time compute from a fixed model, and this remains a challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge by focusing on enhancing the quality of self-reflection data generation for complex problem-solving at test time, which can also subsequently improve the training of next-generation large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we explore how systematically triggering a model's self-correction mechanisms can improve performance on challenging reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose a novel iterative deepening sampling algorithm framework designed to enhance self-correction and generate higher-quality samples. Through extensive experiments on Math500 and AIME benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success rate on difficult tasks and provide detailed ablation studies to analyze its effectiveness across diverse settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced human language understanding and generation, with pretraining data quality and organization being crucial to their performance. Multi-stage pretraining is a promising approach, but existing methods often lack quantitative criteria for data partitioning and instead rely on intuitive heuristics. In this paper, we propose the novel Four-quadRAnt Multi-stage prEtraining strategy (FRAME), guided by the established principle of organizing the pretraining process into four stages to achieve significant loss reductions four times. This principle is grounded in two key findings: first, training on high Perplexity (PPL) data followed by low PPL data, and second, training on low PPL difference (PD) data followed by high PD data, both causing the loss to drop significantly twice and performance enhancements. By partitioning data into four quadrants and strategically organizing them, FRAME achieves a remarkable 16.8% average improvement over random across MMLU and CMMLU for the 3B model, effectively boosting LLM performance.

Abstract: Humans naturally interpret numbers non-literally, effortlessly combining context, world knowledge, and speaker intent. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) interpret numbers similarly, focusing on hyperbole and pragmatic halo effects. Through systematic comparison with human data and computational models of pragmatic reasoning, we find that LLMs diverge from human interpretation in striking ways. By decomposing pragmatic reasoning into testable components, grounded in the Rational Speech Act framework, we pinpoint where LLM processing diverges from human cognition -- not in prior knowledge, but in reasoning with it. This insight leads us to develop a targeted solution -- chain-of-thought prompting inspired by an RSA model makes LLMs' interpretations more human-like. Our work demonstrates how computational cognitive models can both diagnose AI-human differences and guide development of more human-like language understanding capabilities.

Abstract: The recent surge in high-quality open-source Generative AI text models (colloquially: LLMs), as well as efficient finetuning techniques, have opened the possibility of creating high-quality personalized models that generate text attuned to a specific individual's needs and are capable of credibly imitating their writing style by refining an open-source model with that person's own data. The technology to create such models is accessible to private individuals, and training and running such models can be done cheaply on consumer-grade hardware. While these advancements are a huge gain for usability and privacy, this position paper argues that the practical feasibility of impersonating specific individuals also introduces novel safety risks. For instance, this technology enables the creation of phishing emails or fraudulent social media accounts, based on small amounts of publicly available text, or by the individuals themselves to escape AI text detection. We further argue that these risks are complementary to - and distinct from - the much-discussed risks of other impersonation attacks such as image, voice, or video deepfakes, and are not adequately addressed by the larger research community, or the current generation of open- and closed-source models.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP). However, its vast potential remains largely unexplored for graphs. This raises an interesting question: How can we design CoT prompting for graphs to guide graph models to learn step by step? On one hand, unlike natural languages, graphs are non-linear and characterized by complex topological structures. On the other hand, many graphs lack textual data, making it difficult to formulate language-based CoT prompting. In this work, we propose the first CoT prompt learning framework for text-free graphs, GCoT. Specifically, we decompose the adaptation process for each downstream task into a series of inference steps, with each step consisting of prompt-based inference, ``thought'' generation, and thought-conditioned prompt learning. While the steps mimic CoT prompting in NLP, the exact mechanism differs significantly. Specifically, at each step, an input graph, along with a prompt, is first fed into a pre-trained graph encoder for prompt-based inference. We then aggregate the hidden layers of the encoder to construct a ``thought'', which captures the working state of each node in the current step. Conditioned on this thought, we learn a prompt specific to each node based on the current state. These prompts are fed into the next inference step, repeating the cycle. To evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of GCoT, we conduct comprehensive experiments on eight public datasets, which demonstrate the advantage of our approach.

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) models for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) predict the quality of the hypothesis without having access to the reference. An emerging research direction in NMT involves the use of QE models, which have demonstrated high correlations with human judgment and can enhance translations through Quality-Aware Decoding. Although several approaches have been proposed based on sampling multiple candidate translations and picking the best candidate, none have integrated these models directly into the decoding process. In this paper, we address this by proposing a novel token-level QE model capable of reliably scoring partial translations. We build a uni-directional QE model for this, as decoder models are inherently trained and efficient on partial sequences. We then present a decoding strategy that integrates the QE model for Quality-Aware decoding and demonstrate that the translation quality improves when compared to the N-best list re-ranking with state-of-the-art QE models (up to $1.39$ XCOMET-XXL $\uparrow$). Finally, we show that our approach provides significant benefits in document translation tasks, where the quality of N-best lists is typically suboptimal.

Abstract: Mitigating positional bias of language models (LMs) for listwise inputs is a well-known and important problem (e.g., lost-in-the-middle). While zero-shot order-invariant LMs have been proposed to solve this issue, their success on practical listwise problems has been limited. In this work, as a first contribution, we identify and overcome two limitations to make zero-shot invariant LMs more practical: (1) training and inference distribution mismatch arising from modifying positional ID assignments to enforce invariance, and (2) failure to adapt to mixture of order-invariant and sensitive inputs in practical listwise problems. Then, to overcome these issues we propose (1) RoToR, a zero-shot invariant LM for genuinely order-invariant inputs with minimal modifications of positional IDs, and (2) Selective Routing, an adaptive framework that handles both order-invariant and order-sensitive inputs in listwise tasks. On the Lost in the middle (LitM), Knowledge Graph QA (KGQA), and MMLU benchmarks, we show that RoToR with Selective Routing can effectively handle practical listwise input tasks in a zero-shot manner (https://github.com/soyoung97/RoToR)

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations and outdated knowledge due to their reliance on static training data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by integrating external dynamic information for improved factual grounding. With advances in multimodal learning, Multimodal RAG extends this approach by incorporating multiple modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to enhance the generated outputs. However, cross-modal alignment and reasoning introduce unique challenges beyond those in unimodal RAG. This survey offers a structured and comprehensive analysis of Multimodal RAG systems, covering datasets, benchmarks, metrics, evaluation, methodologies, and innovations in retrieval, fusion, augmentation, and generation. We review training strategies, robustness enhancements, loss functions, and agent-based approaches, while also exploring the diverse Multimodal RAG scenarios. In addition, we outline open challenges and future directions to guide research in this evolving field. This survey lays the foundation for developing more capable and reliable AI systems that effectively leverage multimodal dynamic external knowledge bases.

Abstract: While ChatGPT and GPT-based models are able to effectively perform many tasks without additional fine-tuning, they struggle with tasks related to extremely low-resource languages and indigenous languages. Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR), a semantic representation designed to capture the meaning of texts in many languages, is well-positioned to be leveraged in the development of low-resource language technologies. In this work, we explore the downstream utility of UMR for low-resource languages by incorporating it into GPT-4 prompts. Specifically, we examine the ability of GPT-4 to perform translation from three indigenous languages (Navajo, Ar\'apaho, and Kukama), with and without demonstrations, as well as with and without UMR annotations. Ultimately, we find that in the majority of our test cases, integrating UMR into the prompt results in a statistically significant increase in performance, which is a promising indication of future applications of the UMR formalism.

Abstract: Hubness, the tendency for a few points to be among the nearest neighbours of a disproportionate number of other points, commonly arises when applying standard distance measures to high-dimensional data, often negatively impacting distance-based analysis. As autoregressive large language models (LLMs) operate on high-dimensional representations, we ask whether they are also affected by hubness. We first prove that the only large-scale representation comparison operation performed by LLMs, namely that between context and unembedding vectors to determine continuation probabilities, is not characterized by the concentration of distances phenomenon that typically causes the appearance of nuisance hubness. We then empirically show that this comparison still leads to a high degree of hubness, but the hubs in this case do not constitute a disturbance. They are rather the result of context-modulated frequent tokens often appearing in the pool of likely candidates for next token prediction. However, when other distances are used to compare LLM representations, we do not have the same theoretical guarantees, and, indeed, we see nuisance hubs appear. There are two main takeaways. First, hubness, while omnipresent in high-dimensional spaces, is not a negative property that needs to be mitigated when LLMs are being used for next token prediction. Second, when comparing representations from LLMs using Euclidean or cosine distance, there is a high risk of nuisance hubs and practitioners should use mitigation techniques if relevant.

Abstract: Mental health is increasingly critical in contemporary healthcare, with psychotherapy demanding dynamic, context-sensitive interactions that traditional NLP methods struggle to capture. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential for addressing this gap due to their ability to handle extensive context and multi-turn reasoning. This review introduces a conceptual taxonomy dividing psychotherapy into interconnected stages--assessment, diagnosis, and treatment--to systematically examine LLM advancements and challenges. Our comprehensive analysis reveals imbalances in current research, such as a focus on common disorders, linguistic biases, fragmented methods, and limited theoretical integration. We identify critical challenges including capturing dynamic symptom fluctuations, overcoming linguistic and cultural biases, and ensuring diagnostic reliability. Highlighting future directions, we advocate for continuous multi-stage modeling, real-time adaptive systems grounded in psychological theory, and diversified research covering broader mental disorders and therapeutic approaches, aiming toward more holistic and clinically integrated psychotherapy LLMs systems.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.

Abstract: Despite near-perfect results reported in the literature, the effectiveness of model editing in real-world applications remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce QAEdit, a new benchmark aligned with widely used question answering (QA) datasets, and WILD, a task-agnostic evaluation framework designed to better reflect real-world usage of model editing. Our single editing experiments show that current editing methods perform substantially worse than previously reported (38.5% vs. 96.8%). We demonstrate that it stems from issues in the synthetic evaluation practices of prior work. Among them, the most severe is the use of teacher forcing during testing, which leaks both content and length of the ground truth, leading to overestimated performance. Furthermore, we simulate practical deployment by sequential editing, revealing that current approaches fail drastically with only 1000 edits. This work calls for a shift in model editing research toward rigorous evaluation and the development of robust, scalable methods that can reliably update knowledge in LLMs for real-world use.

Abstract: The paper explores the performance of LLMs in the context of multi-dimensional analytic writing assessments, i.e. their ability to provide both scores and comments based on multiple assessment criteria. Using a corpus of literature reviews written by L2 graduate students and assessed by human experts against 9 analytic criteria, we prompt several popular LLMs to perform the same task under various conditions. To evaluate the quality of feedback comments, we apply a novel feedback comment quality evaluation framework. This framework is interpretable, cost-efficient, scalable, and reproducible, compared to existing methods that rely on manual judgments. We find that LLMs can generate reasonably good and generally reliable multi-dimensional analytic assessments. We release our corpus and code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Personalized dialogue systems have advanced considerably with the integration of user-specific personas into large language models (LLMs). However, while LLMs can effectively generate personalized responses, the influence of persona sentiment on dialogue quality remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale analysis of dialogues generated using a range of polarized user profiles. Our experiments reveal that dialogues involving negatively polarized users tend to overemphasize persona attributes. In contrast, positively polarized profiles yield dialogues that selectively incorporate persona information, resulting in smoother interactions. Furthermore, we find that personas with weak or neutral sentiment generally produce lower-quality dialogues. Motivated by these findings, we propose a dialogue generation approach that explicitly accounts for persona polarity by combining a turn-based generation strategy with a profile ordering mechanism and sentiment-aware prompting. Our study provides new insights into the sensitivity of LLMs to persona sentiment and offers guidance for developing more robust and nuanced personalized dialogue systems.

<title>If Attention Serves as a Cognitive Model of Human Memory Retrieval, What is the Plausible Memory Representation?</title>

Abstract: Recent work in computational psycholinguistics has revealed intriguing parallels between attention mechanisms and human memory retrieval, focusing primarily on vanilla Transformers that operate on token-level representations. However, computational psycholinguistic research has also established that syntactic structures provide compelling explanations for human sentence processing that token-level factors cannot fully account for. In this paper, we investigate whether the attention mechanism of Transformer Grammar (TG), which uniquely operates on syntactic structures as representational units, can serve as a cognitive model of human memory retrieval, using Normalized Attention Entropy (NAE) as a linking hypothesis between models and humans. Our experiments demonstrate that TG's attention achieves superior predictive power for self-paced reading times compared to vanilla Transformer's, with further analyses revealing independent contributions from both models. These findings suggest that human sentence processing involves dual memory representations -- one based on syntactic structures and another on token sequences -- with attention serving as the general memory retrieval algorithm, while highlighting the importance of incorporating syntactic structures as representational units.

Abstract: Data augmentation is an essential technique in natural language processing (NLP) for enriching training datasets by generating diverse samples. This process is crucial for improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of NLP models. However, a significant challenge remains: \textit{Insufficient Attention to Sample Distribution Diversity}. Most existing methods focus on increasing the sample numbers while neglecting the sample distribution diversity, which can lead to model overfitting. In response, we explore data augmentation's impact on dataset diversity and propose a \textbf{\underline{D}}iversity-\textbf{\underline{o}}riented data \textbf{\underline{Aug}}mentation framework (\textbf{DoAug}). % \(\mathscr{DoAug}\) Specifically, we utilize a diversity-oriented fine-tuning approach to train an LLM as a diverse paraphraser, which is capable of augmenting textual datasets by generating diversified paraphrases. Then, we apply the LLM paraphraser to a selected coreset of highly informative samples and integrate the paraphrases with the original data to create a more diverse augmented dataset. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world textual datasets. The results show that our fine-tuned LLM augmenter improves diversity while preserving label consistency, thereby enhancing the robustness and performance of downstream tasks. Specifically, it achieves an average performance gain of \(10.52\%\), surpassing the runner-up baseline with more than three percentage points.

Abstract: Recent advancements in table-based reasoning have expanded beyond factoid-level QA to address insight-level tasks, where systems should synthesize implicit knowledge in the table to provide explainable analyses. Although effective, existing studies remain confined to scenarios where a single gold table is given alongside the user query, failing to address cases where users seek comprehensive insights from multiple unknown tables. To bridge these gaps, we propose MT-RAIG Bench, design to evaluate systems on Retrieval-Augmented Insight Generation over Mulitple-Tables. Additionally, to tackle the suboptimality of existing automatic evaluation methods in the table domain, we further introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework MT-RAIG Eval, which achieves better alignment with human quality judgments on the generated insights. We conduct extensive experiments and reveal that even frontier LLMs still struggle with complex multi-table reasoning, establishing our MT-RAIG Bench as a challenging testbed for future research.

Abstract: Understanding pragmatics-the use of language in context-is crucial for developing NLP systems capable of interpreting nuanced language use. Despite recent advances in language technologies, including large language models, evaluating their ability to handle pragmatic phenomena such as implicatures and references remains challenging. To advance pragmatic abilities in models, it is essential to understand current evaluation trends and identify existing limitations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of resources designed for evaluating pragmatic capabilities in NLP, categorizing datasets by the pragmatics phenomena they address. We analyze task designs, data collection methods, evaluation approaches, and their relevance to real-world applications. By examining these resources in the context of modern language models, we highlight emerging trends, challenges, and gaps in existing benchmarks. Our survey aims to clarify the landscape of pragmatic evaluation and guide the development of more comprehensive and targeted benchmarks, ultimately contributing to more nuanced and context-aware NLP models.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding optimizes output selection by maximizing the expected utility value of an underlying human distribution. While prior work has shown the effectiveness of MBR decoding through empirical evaluation, few studies have analytically investigated why the method is effective. As a result of our analysis, we show that, given the size $n$ of the reference hypothesis set used in computation, MBR decoding approaches the optimal solution with high probability at a rate of $O\left(n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, under certain assumptions, even though the language space $Y$ is significantly larger $|Y|\gg n$. This result helps to theoretically explain the strong performance observed in several prior empirical studies on MBR decoding. In addition, we provide the performance gap for maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) decoding and compare it to MBR decoding. The result of this paper indicates that MBR decoding tends to converge to the optimal solution faster than MAP decoding in several cases.

Abstract: Inverse tasks can uncover potential reasoning gaps as Large Language Models (LLMs) scale up. In this work, we explore the redefinition task, in which we assign alternative values to well-known physical constants and units of measure, prompting LLMs to respond accordingly. Our findings show that not only does model performance degrade with scale, but its false confidence also rises. Moreover, while factors such as prompting strategies or response formatting are influential, they do not preclude LLMs from anchoring to memorized values.

Abstract: We study word learning in subword and character language models with the psycholinguistic lexical decision task. While subword LMs struggle to discern words and non-words with high accuracy, character LMs solve this task easily and consistently. Only when supplied with further contexts do subword LMs perform similarly to character models. Additionally, when looking at word-level and syntactic learning trajectories, we find that both processes are separable in character LMs. Word learning happens before syntactic learning, whereas both occur simultaneously in subword LMs. This raises questions about the adequacy of subword LMs for modeling language acquisition and positions character LMs as a viable alternative to study processes below the syntactic level.

Abstract: Since the adoption of large language models (LLMs) for text evaluation has become increasingly prevalent in the field of natural language processing (NLP), a series of existing works attempt to optimize the prompts for LLM evaluators to improve their alignment with human judgment. However, their efforts are limited to optimizing individual factors of evaluation prompts, such as evaluation criteria or output formats, neglecting the combinatorial impact of multiple factors, which leads to insufficient optimization of the evaluation pipeline. Nevertheless, identifying well-behaved prompting strategies for adjusting multiple factors requires extensive enumeration. To this end, we comprehensively integrate 8 key factors for evaluation prompts and propose a novel automatic prompting strategy optimization method called Heuristic Prompting Strategy Search (HPSS). Inspired by the genetic algorithm, HPSS conducts an iterative search to find well-behaved prompting strategies for LLM evaluators. A heuristic function is employed to guide the search process, enhancing the performance of our algorithm. Extensive experiments across four evaluation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of HPSS, consistently outperforming both human-designed evaluation prompts and existing automatic prompt optimization methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-coai/HPSS.

Abstract: Should LLMs generate language that makes them seem human? Human-like language might improve user experience, but might also lead to deception, overreliance, and stereotyping. Assessing these potential impacts requires a systematic way to measure human-like tone in LLM outputs. We introduce HumT and SocioT, metrics for human-like tone and other dimensions of social perceptions in text data based on relative probabilities from an LLM. By measuring HumT across preference and usage datasets, we find that users prefer less human-like outputs from LLMs in many contexts. HumT also offers insights into the perceptions and impacts of anthropomorphism: human-like LLM outputs are highly correlated with warmth, social closeness, femininity, and low status, which are closely linked to the aforementioned harms. We introduce DumT, a method using HumT to systematically control and reduce the degree of human-like tone while preserving model performance. DumT offers a practical approach for mitigating risks associated with anthropomorphic language generation.

Abstract: Alignment techniques have become central to ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate outputs consistent with human values. However, existing alignment paradigms often model an averaged or monolithic preference, failing to account for the diversity of perspectives across cultures, demographics, and communities. This limitation is particularly critical in health-related scenarios, where plurality is essential due to the influence of culture, religion, personal values, and conflicting opinions. Despite progress in pluralistic alignment, no prior work has focused on health, likely due to the unavailability of publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a new benchmark dataset comprising 13.1K value-laden situations and 5.4K multiple-choice questions focused on health, designed to assess and benchmark pluralistic alignment methodologies. Through extensive evaluation of eight LLMs of varying sizes, we demonstrate that existing pluralistic alignment techniques fall short in effectively accommodating diverse healthcare beliefs, underscoring the need for tailored AI alignment in specific domains. This work highlights the limitations of current approaches and lays the groundwork for developing health-specific alignment solutions.

Abstract: We introduce TESS 2, a general instruction-following diffusion language model that outperforms contemporary instruction-tuned diffusion models, as well as matches and sometimes exceeds strong autoregressive (AR) models. We train TESS 2 by first adapting a strong AR model via continued pretraining with the usual cross-entropy as diffusion loss, and then performing further instruction tuning. We find that adaptation training as well as the choice of the base model is crucial for training good instruction-following diffusion models. We further propose reward guidance, a novel and modular inference-time guidance procedure to align model outputs without needing to train the underlying model. Finally, we show that TESS 2 further improves with increased inference-time compute, highlighting the utility of diffusion LMs in having fine-grained controllability over the amount of compute used at inference time. Code and models are available at https://github.com/hamishivi/tess-2.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown great promise for knowledge-intensive tasks and recently advanced with agentic RAG, where language agents engage in multi-round interactions with external knowledge sources for adaptive information retrieval. However, existing agentic RAG methods often depend on ad-hoc prompt engineering and lack a unified optimization framework. We introduce RAG-Gym, a comprehensive platform that systematically explores three optimization dimensions: (1) prompt engineering, (2) actor tuning, and (3) critic training. For prompt engineering, we propose Re$^2$Search, a novel agent incorporating reasoning reflection that significantly outperforms standard prompts. In actor tuning, we evaluate three popular post-training algorithms with fine-grained process supervision and identify direct preference optimization as the most effective. We further demonstrate that a trained critic can enhance inference by selecting higher-quality intermediate reasoning steps. Together, these findings lead to the optimized Re$^2$Search++ agent, which surpasses most recent methods like Search-R1 by a relative increase of 3.2% to 11.6% in average F1. Finally, we examine the impact of different reward sources and analyze scaling properties in training and inference, offering practical insights for agentic RAG optimization.

<title>Which of These Best Describes Multiple Choice Evaluation with LLMs? A) Forced B) Flawed C) Fixable D) All of the Above</title>

Abstract: Multiple choice question answering (MCQA) is popular for LLM evaluation due to its simplicity and human-like testing, but we argue for its reform. We first reveal flaws in MCQA's format, as it struggles to: 1) test generation/subjectivity; 2) match LLM use cases; and 3) fully test knowledge. We instead advocate for generative formats based on human testing, where LLMs construct and explain answers, better capturing user needs and knowledge while remaining easy to score. We then show even when MCQA is a useful format, its datasets suffer from: leakage; unanswerability; shortcuts; and saturation. In each issue, we give fixes from education, like rubrics to guide MCQ writing; scoring methods to bridle guessing; and Item Response Theory to build harder MCQs. Lastly, we discuss LLM errors in MCQA, robustness, biases, and unfaithful explanations, showing how our prior solutions better measure or address these issues. While we do not need to desert MCQA, we encourage more efforts in refining the task based on educational testing, advancing evaluations.

Abstract: While the ability of language models to elicit facts has been widely investigated, how they handle temporally changing facts remains underexplored. We discover Temporal Heads, specific attention heads that primarily handle temporal knowledge, through circuit analysis. We confirm that these heads are present across multiple models, though their specific locations may vary, and their responses differ depending on the type of knowledge and its corresponding years. Disabling these heads degrades the model's ability to recall time-specific knowledge while maintaining its general capabilities without compromising time-invariant and question-answering performances. Moreover, the heads are activated not only numeric conditions ("In 2004") but also textual aliases ("In the year ..."), indicating that they encode a temporal dimension beyond simple numerical representation. Furthermore, we expand the potential of our findings by demonstrating how temporal knowledge can be edited by adjusting the values of these heads.

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of novel capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), the need for rigorous multilingual and multicultural benchmarks that are integrated has become more pronounced. Though existing LLM benchmarks are capable of evaluating specific capabilities of LLMs in English as well as in various mid- to low-resource languages, including those in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region, a comprehensive and culturally representative evaluation suite for the SEA languages has not been developed thus far. Here, we present SEA-HELM, a holistic linguistic and cultural LLM evaluation suite that emphasises SEA languages, comprising five core pillars: (1) NLP Classics, (2) LLM-specifics, (3) SEA Linguistics, (4) SEA Culture, (5) Safety. SEA-HELM currently supports Filipino, Indonesian, Tamil, Thai, and Vietnamese. We also introduce the SEA-HELM leaderboard, which allows users to understand models' multilingual and multicultural performance in a systematic and user-friendly manner. We make the SEA-HELM evaluation code publicly available.

Abstract: Many sensitive domains -- such as the clinical domain -- lack widely available datasets due to privacy risks. The increasing generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made synthetic datasets a viable path forward. In this study, we domain-adapt LLMs to the clinical domain and generate synthetic clinical texts that are machine-annotated with tags for personally identifiable information using capable encoder-based NER models. The synthetic corpora are then used to train synthetic NER models. The results show that training NER models using synthetic corpora incurs only a small drop in predictive performance. The limits of this process are investigated in a systematic ablation study -- using both Swedish and Spanish data. Our analysis shows that smaller datasets can be sufficient for domain-adapting LLMs for data synthesis. Instead, the effectiveness of this process is almost entirely contingent on the performance of the machine-annotating NER models trained using the original data.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance in English, but their effectiveness in Japanese remains limited due to the lack of high-quality training data. Current Japanese LMMs often rely on translated English datasets, restricting their ability to capture Japan-specific cultural knowledge. To address this, we explore the potential of Japanese PDF data as a training resource, an area that remains largely underutilized. We introduce a fully automated pipeline that leverages pretrained models to extract image-text pairs from PDFs through layout analysis, OCR, and vision-language pairing, removing the need for manual annotation. Additionally, we construct instruction data from extracted image-text pairs to enrich the training data. To evaluate the effectiveness of PDF-derived data, we train Japanese LMMs and assess their performance on the Japanese LMM Benchmark. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements, with performance gains ranging from 2.1% to 13.8% on Heron-Bench. Further analysis highlights the impact of PDF-derived data on various factors, such as model size and language models, reinforcing its value as a multimodal resource for Japanese LMMs.

Abstract: To compare autoregressive language models at scale, we propose using log-likelihood vectors computed on a predefined text set as model features. This approach has a solid theoretical basis: when treated as model coordinates, their squared Euclidean distance approximates the Kullback-Leibler divergence of text-generation probabilities. Our method is highly scalable, with computational cost growing linearly in both the number of models and text samples, and is easy to implement as the required features are derived from cross-entropy loss. Applying this method to over 1,000 language models, we constructed a "model map," providing a new perspective on large-scale model analysis.

Abstract: Scientific communication is receiving increasing attention in natural language processing, especially to help researches access, summarize, and generate content. One emerging application in this area is Speech-to-Abstract Generation (SAG), which aims to automatically generate abstracts from recorded scientific presentations. SAG enables researchers to efficiently engage with conference talks, but progress has been limited by a lack of large-scale datasets. To address this gap, we introduce NUTSHELL, a novel multimodal dataset of *ACL conference talks paired with their corresponding abstracts. We establish strong baselines for SAG and evaluate the quality of generated abstracts using both automatic metrics and human judgments. Our results highlight the challenges of SAG and demonstrate the benefits of training on NUTSHELL. By releasing NUTSHELL under an open license (CC-BY 4.0), we aim to advance research in SAG and foster the development of improved models and evaluation methods.

Abstract: Data diversity is crucial for the instruction tuning of large language models. Existing studies have explored various diversity-aware data selection methods to construct high-quality datasets and enhance model performance. However, the fundamental problem of precisely defining and measuring data diversity remains underexplored, limiting clear guidance for data engineering. To address this, we systematically analyze 11 existing diversity measurement methods by evaluating their correlation with model performance through extensive fine-tuning experiments. Our results indicate that a reliable diversity measure should properly account for both inter-sample differences and the information density in the sample space. Building on this, we propose NovelSum, a new diversity metric based on sample-level "novelty." Experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that NovelSum accurately captures diversity variations and achieves a 0.97 correlation with instruction-tuned model performance, highlighting its value in guiding data engineering practices. With NovelSum as an optimization objective, we further develop a greedy, diversity-oriented data selection strategy that outperforms existing approaches, validating both the effectiveness and practical significance of our metric. The code is available at https://github.com/UmeanNever/NovelSum.

A common argument against this idea is that because their architecture and training paradigm are so vastly different from humans, LMs can learn arbitrary inputs as easily as natural languages. We test this claim by training LMs to model impossible and typologically unattested languages. Unlike previous work, which has focused exclusively on English, we conduct experiments on 12 languages from 4 language families with two newly constructed parallel corpora. Our results show that while GPT-2 small can largely distinguish attested languages from their impossible counterparts, it does not achieve perfect separation between all the attested languages and all the impossible ones. We further test whether GPT-2 small distinguishes typologically attested from unattested languages with different NP orders by manipulating word order based on Greenberg's Universal 20. We find that the model's perplexity scores do not distinguish attested vs. unattested word orders, while its performance on the generalization test does. These findings suggest that LMs exhibit some human-like inductive biases, though these biases are weaker than those found in human learners.

Abstract: User simulators are crucial for replicating human interactions with dialogue systems, supporting both collaborative training and automatic evaluation, especially for large language models (LLMs). However, current role-playing methods face challenges such as a lack of utterance-level authenticity and user-level diversity, often hindered by role confusion and dependence on predefined profiles of well-known figures. In contrast, direct simulation focuses solely on text, neglecting implicit user traits like personality and conversation-level consistency. To address these issues, we introduce the User Simulator with Implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user profiles from human-machine interactions to simulate personalized and realistic dialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a comprehensive profile schema, then refine the simulation using conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle consistency, optimizing at both the utterance and conversation levels. Finally, a diverse profile sampler captures the distribution of real-world user profiles. Experimental results show that USP outperforms strong baselines in terms of authenticity and diversity while maintaining comparable consistency. Additionally, using USP to evaluate LLM on dynamic multi-turn aligns well with mainstream benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Test-time computing approaches, which leverage additional computational resources during inference, have been proven effective in enhancing large language model performance. This work introduces a novel, linearly scaling approach, TestNUC, that improves test-time predictions by leveraging the local consistency of neighboring unlabeled data-it classifies an input instance by considering not only the model's prediction on that instance but also on neighboring unlabeled instances. We evaluate TestNUC across eight diverse datasets, spanning intent classification, topic mining, domain discovery, and emotion detection, demonstrating its consistent superiority over baseline methods such as standard prompting and self-consistency. Furthermore, TestNUC can be seamlessly integrated with existing test-time computing approaches, substantially boosting their performance. Our analysis reveals that TestNUC scales effectively with increasing amounts of unlabeled data and performs robustly across different embedding models, making it practical for real-world applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/HenryPengZou/TestNUC.

Abstract: We propose EdiText, a controllable text editing method that modifies the reference text to desired attributes at various scales. We integrate an SDEdit-based editing technique that allows for broad adjustments in the degree of text editing. Additionally, we introduce a novel fine-level editing method based on self-conditioning, which allows subtle control of reference text. While being capable of editing on its own, this fine-grained method, integrated with the SDEdit approach, enables EdiText to make precise adjustments within the desired range. EdiText demonstrates its controllability to robustly adjust reference text at a broad range of levels across various tasks, including toxicity control and sentiment control.

<title>FINEREASON: Evaluating and Improving LLMs' Deliberate Reasoning through Reflective Puzzle Solving</title>

Abstract: Many challenging reasoning tasks require not just rapid, intuitive responses, but a more deliberate, multi-step approach. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights an important shift from the "System 1" way of quick reactions to the "System 2" style of reflection-and-correction problem solving. However, current benchmarks heavily rely on the final-answer accuracy, leaving much of a model's intermediate reasoning steps unexamined. This fails to assess the model's ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Each puzzle can be decomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of intermediate correctness. Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking, and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move. To support broader research, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing performance on general mathematical tasks. We show that models trained on our state checking and transition data demonstrate gains in math reasoning by up to 5.1% on GSM8K.

Abstract: Tokenization, a crucial initial step in natural language processing, is governed by several key parameters, such as the tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, pre-tokenization strategy, inference strategy, and training data corpus. This paper investigates the impact of an often-overlooked hyperparameter, tokenizer training data size. We train BPE, UnigramLM, and WordPiece tokenizers across various vocabulary sizes using English training data ranging from 1GB to 900GB. Our findings reveal diminishing returns as training data size increases beyond roughly 150GB, suggesting a practical limit to the improvements in tokenization quality achievable through additional data. We analyze this phenomenon and attribute the saturation effect to constraints introduced by the pre-tokenization stage. We then demonstrate the extent to which these findings can generalize by experimenting on data in Russian, a language typologically distant from English. While the limit appears to materialize at a later phase of pre-training, around 200GB, it is in fact observed. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing the tokenization process by reducing the compute required for training on large corpora and suggest promising directions for future research in tokenization algorithms.

Abstract: Visualizations play a pivotal role in daily communication in an increasingly datadriven world. Research on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for automated chart understanding has accelerated massively, with steady improvements on standard benchmarks. However, for MLLMs to be reliable, they must be robust to misleading visualizations, i.e., charts that distort the underlying data, leading readers to draw inaccurate conclusions that may support disinformation. Here, we uncover an important vulnerability: MLLM questionanswering (QA) accuracy on misleading visualizations drops on average to the level of the random baseline. To address this, we introduce the first inference-time methods to improve QA performance on misleading visualizations, without compromising accuracy on non-misleading ones. We find that two methods, table-based QA and redrawing the visualization, are effective, with improvements of up to 19.6 percentage points. We make our code and data available.

Abstract: Text editing frames grammatical error correction (GEC) as a sequence tagging problem, where edit tags are assigned to input tokens, and applying these edits results in the corrected text. This approach has gained attention for its efficiency and interpretability. However, while extensively explored for English, text editing remains largely underexplored for morphologically rich languages like Arabic. In this paper, we introduce a text editing approach that derives edit tags directly from data, eliminating the need for language-specific edits. We demonstrate its effectiveness on Arabic, a diglossic and morphologically rich language, and investigate the impact of different edit representations on model performance. Our approach achieves SOTA results on two Arabic GEC benchmarks and performs on par with SOTA on two others. Additionally, our models are over six times faster than existing Arabic GEC systems, making our approach more practical for real-world applications. Finally, we explore ensemble models, demonstrating how combining different models leads to further performance improvements. We make our code, data, and pretrained models publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle with low-resource languages (LRLs), particularly those spoken by minority communities in China, such as Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian. To systematically track the progress in these languages, we introduce MiLiC-Eval, a benchmark designed for minority languages in China, featuring 24K instances across 9 tasks. MiLiC-Eval focuses on underrepresented writing systems. Its parallelism between tasks and languages can provide a faithful and fine-grained assessment of linguistic and problem-solving skills. Our evaluation reveals that open-source LLMs perform poorly on syntax-intensive tasks and multi-script languages. We further demonstrate how MiLiC-Eval can help advance LRL research in handling diverse writing systems and understanding the process of language adaptation.

Abstract: This study investigates the machine unlearning techniques within the context of large language models (LLMs), referred to as \textit{LLM unlearning}. LLM unlearning offers a principled approach to removing the influence of undesirable data (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) from LLMs, while preserving their overall utility without requiring full retraining. Despite growing research interest, there is no comprehensive survey that systematically organizes existing work and distills key insights; here, we aim to bridge this gap. We begin by introducing the definition and the paradigms of LLM unlearning, followed by a comprehensive taxonomy of existing unlearning studies. Next, we categorize current unlearning approaches, summarizing their strengths and limitations. Additionally, we review evaluation metrics and benchmarks, providing a structured overview of current assessment methodologies. Finally, we outline promising directions for future research, highlighting key challenges and opportunities in the field.

Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical step in facilitating their widespread application to enhance individual life experiences. In pursuit of personalization, distilling key preference information from an individual's historical data as instructional preference context to customize LLM generation has emerged as a promising direction. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation by overlooking the inter-user comparative analysis, which is essential for identifying the inter-user differences that truly shape preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Difference-aware Personalization Learning (DPL), a novel approach that emphasizes extracting inter-user differences to enhance LLM personalization. DPL strategically selects representative users for comparison and establishes a structured standard to extract meaningful, task-relevant differences for customizing LLM generation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPL significantly enhances LLM personalization. We release our code at https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DPL.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' perceptions and mental states, is fundamental to human interaction but remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing ToM reasoning methods show promise with reasoning via perceptual perspective-taking, they often rely excessively on off-the-shelf LLMs, reducing their efficiency and limiting their applicability to high-order ToM reasoning. To address these issues, we present EnigmaToM, a novel neuro-symbolic framework that enhances ToM reasoning by integrating a Neural Knowledge Base of entity states (Enigma) for (1) a psychology-inspired iterative masking mechanism that facilitates accurate perspective-taking and (2) knowledge injection that elicits key entity information. Enigma generates structured knowledge of entity states to build spatial scene graphs for belief tracking across various ToM orders and enrich events with fine-grained entity state details. Experimental results on ToMi, HiToM, and FANToM benchmarks show that EnigmaToM significantly improves ToM reasoning across LLMs of varying sizes, particularly excelling in high-order reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) encounters challenges when addressing complex queries, particularly multi-hop questions. While several methods tackle multi-hop queries by iteratively generating internal queries and retrieving external documents, these approaches are computationally expensive. In this paper, we identify a three-stage information processing pattern in LLMs during layer-by-layer reasoning, consisting of extraction, processing, and subsequent extraction steps. This observation suggests that the representations in intermediate layers contain richer information compared to those in other layers. Building on this insight, we propose Layer-wise RAG (L-RAG). Unlike prior methods that focus on generating new internal queries, L-RAG leverages intermediate representations from the middle layers, which capture next-hop information, to retrieve external knowledge. L-RAG achieves performance comparable to multi-step approaches while maintaining inference overhead similar to that of standard RAG. Experimental results show that L-RAG outperforms existing RAG methods on open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets, including MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the knowledge outdating problem in Large Language Models (LLMs), it still faces a critical challenge: the prevalence of outdated information in knowledge bases. Current research primarily focuses on incorporating up-to-date information, yet the impact of outdated information coexisting in retrieval sources remains inadequately addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures the evolution of temporal knowledge in real-world facts. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct information, and (2) it can mislead models into generating potentially harmful outputs, even when current information is available. Current RAG approaches struggle with both retrieval and generation aspects when handling outdated information. These findings highlight the urgent need for innovative solutions to address the temporal challenges in RAG. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/0russwest0/HoH.

Abstract: A radiology report comprises several sections, including the Findings and Impression of the diagnosis. Automatically generating the Impression from the Findings is crucial for reducing radiologists' workload and improving diagnostic accuracy. Pretrained models that excel in common abstractive summarization problems encounter challenges when applied to specialized medical domains largely due to the complex terminology and the necessity for accurate clinical context. Such tasks in medical domains demand extracting core information, avoiding context shifts, and maintaining proper flow. Misuse of medical terms can lead to drastic clinical errors. To address these issues, we introduce a sequential transfer learning that ensures key content extraction and coherent summarization. Sequential transfer learning often faces challenges like initial parameter decay and knowledge loss, which we resolve with the Fisher matrix regularization. Using MIMIC-CXR and Open-I datasets, our model, CSTRL - Context-driven Sequential TRansfer Learning - achieved state-of-the-art performance, showing 56.2% improvement in BLEU-1, 40.5% in BLEU-2, 84.3% in BLEU-3, 28.9% in ROUGE-1, 41.0% in ROUGE-2 and 26.5% in ROGUE-3 score over benchmark studies. We also analyze factual consistency scores while preserving the medical context. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/fahmidahossain/Report_Summarization.

Abstract: Integrating structured graph data with rich textual information from nodes poses a significant challenge, particularly for heterophilic node classification. Current approaches often struggle with computational costs or effective fusion of disparate modalities. We propose \textbf{Graph Masked Language Model (GMLM)}, a novel architecture efficiently combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). GMLM introduces three key innovations: (i) a \textbf{dynamic active node selection} strategy for scalable PLM text processing; (ii) a GNN-specific \textbf{contrastive pretraining stage} using soft masking with a learnable graph \texttt{[MASK]} token for robust structural representations; and (iii) a \textbf{dedicated fusion module} integrating RGCN-based GNN embeddings with PLM (GTE-Small \& DistilBERT) embeddings. Extensive experiments on heterophilic benchmarks (Cornell, Wisconsin, Texas) demonstrate GMLM's superiority. Notably, GMLM(DistilBERT) achieves significant performance gains, improving accuracy by over \textbf{4.7\%} on Cornell and over \textbf{2.0\%} on Texas compared to the previous best-performing baselines. This work underscores the benefits of targeted PLM engagement and modality-specific pretraining for improved, efficient learning on text-rich graphs.

Abstract: The field of neural machine translation (NMT) has changed with the advent of large language models (LLMs). Much of the recent emphasis in natural language processing (NLP) has been on modeling machine translation and many other problems using a single pre-trained Transformer decoder, while encoder-decoder architectures, which were the standard in earlier NMT models, have received relatively less attention. In this paper, we explore translation models that are universal, efficient, and easy to optimize, by marrying the world of LLMs with the world of NMT. We apply LLMs to NMT encoding and leave the NMT decoder unchanged. We also develop methods for adapting LLMs to work better with the NMT decoder. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset involving multiple tasks to assess how well the machine translation system generalizes across various tasks. Evaluations on the WMT and our datasets show that results using our method match or surpass a range of baselines in terms of translation quality, but achieve $2.4 \sim 6.5 \times$ inference speedups and a $75\%$ reduction in the memory footprint of the KV cache. It also demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of translation-related tasks.

Abstract: Test-time compute is emerging as a new paradigm for enhancing language models' complex multi-step reasoning capabilities, as demonstrated by the success of OpenAI's o1 and o3, as well as DeepSeek's R1. Compared to explicit reasoning in test-time compute, implicit reasoning is more inference-efficient, requiring fewer generated tokens. However, why does the advanced reasoning capability fail to emerge in the implicit reasoning style? In this work, we train GPT-2 from scratch on a curated multi-step mathematical reasoning dataset and conduct analytical experiments to investigate how language models perform implicit reasoning in multi-step tasks. Our findings reveal: 1) Language models can perform step-by-step reasoning and achieve high accuracy in both in-domain and out-of-domain tests via implicit reasoning. However, this capability only emerges when trained on fixed-pattern data. 2) Conversely, implicit reasoning abilities emerging from training on unfixed-pattern data tend to overfit a specific pattern and fail to generalize further. Notably, this limitation is also observed in state-of-the-art large language models. These findings suggest that language models acquire implicit reasoning through shortcut learning, enabling strong performance on tasks with similar patterns while lacking generalization.

Abstract: Transformers often struggle to generalize to longer sequences than those seen during training, a limitation known as length extrapolation. Most existing Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) methods attempt to address this by introducing either fixed linear biases or globally learned biases, which lack the capacity to adapt to different input contexts. In this work, we propose an additive RPE, Context-Aware Biases for Length Extrapolation (CABLE), a method that learns token-specific, context-aware biases for each attention head in transformers. By dynamically adjusting positional biases based on the input sequence, CABLE overcomes the rigidity of fixed RPEs. When evaluated on sequences longer than originally trained with, GPT-2 Medium (334M parameters) with CABLE achieves lower perplexity than counterparts using other widely adopted positional encoding methods. Additionally, by applying CABLE to the BERT base model we improved performance in long-context retrieval tasks. Our method significantly enhances the extrapolation performance of existing RPE methods tested on the FineWeb-Edu10B and WikiText-103 datasets. Code is available at: https://github.com/axiomlab/cable

Abstract: Despite the remarkable successes of large language models (LLMs), the underlying Transformer architecture has inherent limitations in handling complex reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a practical workaround, but most CoT-based methods rely on a single, generic prompt such as "think step by step", with no task-specific adaptation. These approaches expect the model to discover an effective reasoning path on its own, forcing it to search through a vast prompt space. In contrast, several studies have explored task-specific prompt designs to boost performance. However, these designs are typically developed through trial and error, lacking theoretical grounding. As a result, prompt engineering remains largely ad hoc and unguided. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that explains why some prompts succeed while others fail. We show that prompts function as selectors, extracting task-relevant information from the model's full hidden state during CoT reasoning. Each prompt defines a unique trajectory through the answer space, and the choice of trajectory is crucial for task performance and future navigation within the space. We analyze the complexity of finding optimal prompts and characterize the size of the prompt space for a given task. Our theory reveals principles behind effective prompt design and shows that naive CoT-using self-guided prompts like "think step by step"-can severely hinder performance. Through experiments, we show that optimal prompt search can lead to more than a 50% improvement on reasoning tasks, providing a theoretical foundation for prompt engineering.

<title>ClusComp: A Simple Paradigm for Model Compression and Efficient Finetuning</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, model compression is crucial for edge deployment and accessibility. Weight-only quantization reduces model size but suffers from performance degradation at lower bit widths. Moreover, standard finetuning is incompatible with quantized models, and alternative methods often fall short of full finetuning. In this paper, we propose ClusComp, a simple yet effective compression paradigm that clusters weight matrices into codebooks and finetunes them block-by-block. ClusComp (1) achieves superior performance in 2-4 bit quantization, (2) pushes compression to 1-bit while outperforming ultra-low-bit methods with minimal finetuning, and (3) enables efficient finetuning, even surpassing existing quantization-based approaches and rivaling full FP16 finetuning. Notably, ClusComp supports compression and finetuning of 70B LLMs on a single A6000-48GB GPU.

Abstract: Language models excel at following instructions but often struggle with the collaborative aspects of conversation that humans naturally employ. This limitation in grounding -- the process by which conversation participants establish mutual understanding -- can lead to outcomes ranging from frustrated users to serious consequences in high-stakes scenarios. To systematically study grounding challenges in human-LLM interactions, we analyze logs from three human-assistant datasets: WildChat, MultiWOZ, and Bing Chat. We develop a taxonomy of grounding acts and build models to annotate and forecast grounding behavior. Our findings reveal significant differences in human-human and human-LLM grounding: LLMs were three times less likely to initiate clarification and sixteen times less likely to provide follow-up requests than humans. Additionally, we find that early grounding failures predict later interaction breakdowns. Building on these insights, we introduce Rifts, a benchmark derived from publicly available LLM interaction data containing situations where LLMs fail to initiate grounding. We note that current frontier models perform poorly on Rifts, highlighting the need to reconsider how we train and prompt LLMs for human interaction. To this end, we develop a preliminary intervention aimed at mitigating grounding failures.

<title>SPILL: Domain-Adaptive Intent Clustering based on Selection and Pooling with Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15351</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15351</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.15351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Selection and Pooling with Large Language Models (SPILL), an intuitive and domain-adaptive method for intent clustering without fine-tuning. Existing embeddings-based clustering methods rely on a few labeled examples or unsupervised fine-tuning to optimize results for each new dataset, which makes them less generalizable to multiple datasets. Our goal is to make these existing embedders more generalizable to new domain datasets without further fine-tuning. Inspired by our theoretical derivation and simulation results on the effectiveness of sampling and pooling techniques, we view the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem. A good solution to this problem is associated with better clustering performance. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage approach: First, for each utterance (referred to as the seed), we derive its embedding using an existing embedder. Then, we apply a distance metric to select a pool of candidates close to the seed. Because the embedder is not optimized for new datasets, in the second stage, we use an LLM to further select utterances from these candidates that share the same intent as the seed. Finally, we pool these selected candidates with the seed to derive a refined embedding for the seed. We found that our method generally outperforms directly using an embedder, and it achieves comparable results to other state-of-the-art studies, even those that use much larger models and require fine-tuning, showing its strength and efficiency. Our results indicate that our method enables existing embedders to be further improved without additional fine-tuning, making them more adaptable to new domain datasets. Additionally, viewing the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem gives the potential of using LLMs to customize clustering tasks according to the user's goals.

Abstract: Text classification assigns text to predefined categories. Traditional methods struggle with complex structures and long-range dependencies. Deep learning with recurrent neural networks and Transformer models has improved feature extraction and context awareness. However, these models still trade off interpretability, efficiency and contextual range. We propose the Dynamic Bidirectional Elman Attention Network (DBEAN). DBEAN combines bidirectional temporal modeling and self-attention. It dynamically weights critical input segments and preserves computational efficiency.

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of online discourse, misinformation increasingly adopts humorous tones to evade detection and gain traction. This work introduces Deceptive Humor as a novel research direction, emphasizing how false narratives, when coated in humor, can become more difficult to detect and more likely to spread. To support research in this space, we present the Deceptive Humor Dataset (DHD) a collection of humor-infused comments derived from fabricated claims using the ChatGPT-4o model. Each entry is labeled with a Satire Level (from 1 for subtle satire to 3 for overt satire) and categorized into five humor types: Dark Humor, Irony, Social Commentary, Wordplay, and Absurdity. The dataset spans English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and their code-mixed forms, making it a valuable resource for multilingual analysis. DHD offers a structured foundation for understanding how humor can serve as a vehicle for the propagation of misinformation, subtly enhancing its reach and impact. Strong baselines are established to encourage further research and model development in this emerging area.

Abstract: The meaning conveyed by a sentence often depends on the context in which it appears. Despite the progress of sentence embedding methods, it remains unclear how to best modify a sentence embedding conditioned on its context. To address this problem, we propose Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings (CASE), an efficient and accurate method to create an embedding for a sentence under a given condition. First, CASE creates an embedding for the condition using a Large Language Model (LLM), where the sentence influences the attention scores computed for the tokens in the condition during pooling. Next, a supervised nonlinear projection is learned to reduce the dimensionality of the LLM-based text embeddings. We show that CASE significantly outperforms previously proposed Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) methods on an existing standard benchmark dataset. We find that subtracting the condition embedding consistently improves the C-STS performance of LLM-based text embeddings. Moreover, we propose a supervised dimensionality reduction method that not only reduces the dimensionality of LLM-based embeddings but also significantly improves their performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). However, their direct application to ADS is hindered by challenges such as misunderstanding of traffic knowledge, complex road conditions, and diverse states of vehicle. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Knowledge Editing, which enables targeted modifications to a model's behavior without the need for full retraining. Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions. We hope that our work will contribute to the further advancement of knowledge editing applications in the field of autonomous driving. Code and data are available in https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.

<title>Both Direct and Indirect Evidence Contribute to Dative Alternation Preferences in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) tend to show human-like preferences on a number of syntactic phenomena, but the extent to which these are attributable to direct exposure to the phenomena or more general properties of language is unclear. We explore this with the English dative alternation (DO: "gave Y the X" vs. PO: "gave the X to Y"), using a controlled rearing paradigm wherein we iteratively train small LMs on systematically manipulated input. We focus on properties that affect the choice of alternant: length and animacy. Both properties are directly present in datives but also reflect more global tendencies for shorter elements to precede longer ones and animates to precede inanimates. First, by manipulating and ablating datives for these biases in the input, we show that direct evidence of length and animacy matters, but easy-first preferences persist even without such evidence. Then, using LMs trained on systematically perturbed datasets to manipulate global length effects (re-linearizing sentences globally while preserving dependency structure), we find that dative preferences can emerge from indirect evidence. We conclude that LMs' emergent syntactic preferences come from a mix of direct and indirect sources.

<title>Understanding Inequality of LLM Fact-Checking over Geographic Regions with Agent and Retrieval models</title>

Abstract: Fact-checking is a potentially useful application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat the growing dissemination of disinformation. However, the performance of LLMs varies across geographic regions. In this paper, we evaluate the factual accuracy of open and private models across a diverse set of regions and scenarios.
  Using a dataset containing 600 fact-checked statements balanced across six global regions we examine three experimental setups of fact-checking a statement: (1) when just the statement is available, (2) when an LLM-based agent with Wikipedia access is utilized, and (3) as a best case scenario when a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system provided with the official fact check is employed. Our findings reveal that regardless of the scenario and LLM used, including GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, and LLaMA, statements from the Global North perform substantially better than those from the Global South. Furthermore, this gap is broadened for the more realistic case of a Wikipedia agent-based system, highlighting that overly general knowledge bases have a limited ability to address region-specific nuances. These results underscore the urgent need for better dataset balancing and robust retrieval strategies to enhance LLM fact-checking capabilities, particularly in geographically diverse contexts.

Abstract: This study explores current limitations of learned image captioning evaluation metrics, specifically the lack of granular assessments for errors within captions, and the reliance on single-point quality estimates without considering uncertainty. To address the limitations, we propose a simple yet effective strategy for generating and calibrating distributions of CLIPScore values. Leveraging a model-agnostic conformal risk control framework, we calibrate CLIPScore values for task-specific control variables, tackling the aforementioned limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that using conformal risk control, over score distributions produced with simple methods such as input masking, can achieve competitive performance compared to more complex approaches. Our method effectively detects erroneous words, while providing formal guarantees aligned with desired risk levels. It also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimations and prediction errors, thus enhancing the overall reliability of caption evaluation metrics.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the landscape of machine translation (MT), particularly for low-resource languages and domains that lack sufficient parallel corpora, linguistic tools, and computational infrastructure. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress in leveraging LLMs for MT. We analyze techniques such as few-shot prompting, cross-lingual transfer, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA, adapters) that enable effective adaptation to under-resourced settings. The paper also explores synthetic data generation strategies using LLMs, including back-translation and lexical augmentation. Additionally, we compare LLM-based translation with traditional encoder-decoder models across diverse language pairs, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each. We discuss persistent challenges - such as hallucinations, evaluation inconsistencies, and inherited biases, while also evaluating emerging LLM-driven metrics for translation quality. This survey offers practical insights and outlines future directions for building robust, inclusive, and scalable MT systems in the era of large-scale generative models.

Abstract: Real-world data, such as news articles, social media posts, and chatbot conversations, is inherently dynamic and non-stationary, presenting significant challenges for constructing real-time structured representations through knowledge graphs (KGs). Relation Extraction (RE), a fundamental component of KG creation, often struggles to adapt to evolving data when traditional models rely on static, outdated datasets. Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) methods tackle this issue by incrementally learning new relations while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study investigates the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically large language models (LLMs), to CRE, with a focus on leveraging memory replay to address catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate decoder-only models (eg, Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B) and encoder-decoder models (eg, Flan-T5 Base) on the TACRED and FewRel datasets. Task-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs demonstrates superior performance over earlier approaches using encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, excelling in seen-task accuracy and overall performance (measured by whole and average accuracy), particularly with the Mistral and Flan-T5 models. Results on FewRel are similarly promising, achieving second place in whole and average accuracy metrics. This work underscores critical factors in knowledge transfer, language model architecture, and KG completeness, advancing CRE with LLMs and memory replay for dynamic, real-time relation extraction.

Abstract: Artificial agents are increasingly central to complex interactions and decision-making tasks, yet aligning their behaviors with desired human values remains an open challenge. In this work, we investigate how human-like personality traits influence agent behavior and performance within text-based interactive environments. We introduce PANDA: Personality Adapted Neural Decision Agents, a novel method for projecting human personality traits onto agents to guide their behavior. To induce personality in a text-based game agent, (i) we train a personality classifier to identify what personality type the agent's actions exhibit, and (ii) we integrate the personality profiles directly into the agent's policy-learning pipeline. By deploying agents embodying 16 distinct personality types across 25 text-based games and analyzing their trajectories, we demonstrate that an agent's action decisions can be guided toward specific personality profiles. Moreover, certain personality types, such as those characterized by higher levels of Openness, display marked advantages in performance. These findings underscore the promise of personality-adapted agents for fostering more aligned, effective, and human-centric decision-making in interactive environments.

Abstract: In this work, we establish a novel theoretical connection between supervised fine-tuning and offline reinforcement learning under the token-level Markov decision process, revealing that large language models indeed learn an implicit $Q$-function for inference. Through this theoretical lens, we demonstrate that the widely used beam search method suffers from unacceptable over-optimism, where inference errors are inevitably amplified due to inflated $Q$-value estimations of suboptimal steps. To address this limitation, we propose Supervised Optimism Correction(SOC), which introduces a simple yet effective auxiliary loss for token-level $Q$-value estimations during supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, the auxiliary loss employs implicit value regularization to boost model confidence in expert-demonstrated responses, thereby suppressing over-optimism toward insufficiently supervised responses. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH, and GAOKAO, showcase the superiority of the proposed SOC with beam search across a series of open-source models.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful technique for reducing the latency of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering a fault-tolerant framework that enables the use of highly compressed draft models. In this work, we introduce Self-Distilled Sparse Drafters (SD$^2$), a novel methodology that leverages self-data distillation and fine-grained weight sparsity to produce highly efficient and well-aligned draft models. SD$^2$ systematically enhances draft token acceptance rates while significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate operations (MACs), even in the Universal Assisted Generation (UAG) setting, where draft and target models originate from different model families. On a Llama-3.1-70B target model, SD$^2$ provides a 1.59$\times$ higher Mean Accepted Length (MAL) compared to layer-pruned draft models and reduces MACs by over 43.87% with a 8.36% reduction in MAL compared to a dense draft models. Our 1.5B and 3B unstructured sparse drafters outperform both dense and layer-pruned models in terms of end-to-end latency improvements; highlighting the potential of sparsity-aware fine-tuning and compression strategies to improve LLM inference efficiency while maintaining alignment with target models.

Abstract: The limited reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) cast doubt on their suitability for tasks demanding deep, multi-step logical deduction. This paper introduces a framework called Small Reasons, Large Hints (SMART), which selectively augments SLM reasoning with targeted guidance from large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the concept of cognitive scaffolding, SMART employs a score-based evaluation to identify uncertain reasoning steps and injects corrective LLM-generated reasoning only when necessary. By framing structured reasoning as an optimal policy search, our approach steers the reasoning trajectory toward correct solutions without exhaustive sampling. Our experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that targeted external scaffolding significantly improves performance, paving the way for collaborative use of both SLM and LLM to tackle complex reasoning tasks that are currently unsolvable by SLMs alone.

Abstract: Peer review is a cornerstone of quality control in scientific publishing. With the increasing workload, the unintended use of `quick' heuristics, referred to as lazy thinking, has emerged as a recurring issue compromising review quality. Automated methods to detect such heuristics can help improve the peer-reviewing process. However, there is limited NLP research on this issue, and no real-world dataset exists to support the development of detection tools. This work introduces LazyReview, a dataset of peer-review sentences annotated with fine-grained lazy thinking categories. Our analysis reveals that Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to detect these instances in a zero-shot setting. However, instruction-based fine-tuning on our dataset significantly boosts performance by 10-20 performance points, highlighting the importance of high-quality training data. Furthermore, a controlled experiment demonstrates that reviews revised with lazy thinking feedback are more comprehensive and actionable than those written without such feedback. We will release our dataset and the enhanced guidelines that can be used to train junior reviewers in the community. (Code available here: https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2025-lazy-review)

Abstract: Automatic relationship extraction (RE) from biomedical literature is critical for managing the vast amount of scientific knowledge produced each year. In recent years, utilizing pre-trained language models (PLMs) has become the prevalent approach in RE. Several studies report improved performance when incorporating additional context information while fine-tuning PLMs for RE. However, variations in the PLMs applied, the databases used for augmentation, hyper-parameter optimization, and evaluation methods complicate direct comparisons between studies and raise questions about the generalizability of these findings. Our study addresses this research gap by evaluating PLMs enhanced with contextual information on five datasets spanning four relation scenarios within a consistent evaluation framework. We evaluate three baseline PLMs and first conduct extensive hyperparameter optimization. After selecting the top-performing model, we enhance it with additional data, including textual entity descriptions, relational information from knowledge graphs, and molecular structure encodings. Our findings illustrate the importance of i) the choice of the underlying language model and ii) a comprehensive hyperparameter optimization for achieving strong extraction performance. Although inclusion of context information yield only minor overall improvements, an ablation study reveals substantial benefits for smaller PLMs when such external data was included during fine-tuning.

Abstract: This paper argues that the relationship between lexical identity and prosody -- one well-studied parameter of linguistic variation -- can be characterized using information theory. We predict that languages that use prosody to make lexical distinctions should exhibit a higher mutual information between word identity and prosody, compared to languages that don't. We test this hypothesis in the domain of pitch, which is used to make lexical distinctions in tonal languages, like Cantonese. We use a dataset of speakers reading sentences aloud in ten languages across five language families to estimate the mutual information between the text and their pitch curves. We find that, across languages, pitch curves display similar amounts of entropy. However, these curves are easier to predict given their associated text in the tonal languages, compared to pitch- and stress-accent languages, and thus the mutual information is higher in these languages, supporting our hypothesis. Our results support perspectives that view linguistic typology as gradient, rather than categorical.

Abstract: Recent improvement in large language model performance have, in all likelihood, been accompanied by improvement in how well they can approximate the distribution of their training data. In this work, we explore the following question: which properties of text domains do LLMs faithfully approximate, and how well do they do so? Applying observational approaches familiar from corpus linguistics, we prompt a commonly used, opensource LLM to regenerate text from two domains of permissively licensed English text which are often contained in LLM training data -- Wikipedia and news text. This regeneration paradigm allows us to investigate whether LLMs can faithfully match the original human text domains in a fairly semantically-controlled setting. We investigate varying levels of syntactic abstraction, from more simple properties like sentence length, and article readability, to more complex and higher order properties such as dependency tag distribution, parse depth, and parse complexity. We find that the majority of the regenerated distributions show a shifted mean, a lower standard deviation, and a reduction of the long tail, as compared to the human originals.

Abstract: Motivated by the surge of large language models, there has been a push to formally characterize the symbolic abilities intrinsic to the transformer architecture. A programming language, called RASP, has been proposed, which can be directly compiled into transformer weights to implement these algorithms. However, the tasks that can be implemented in RASP are often uncommon to learn from natural unsupervised data, showing a mismatch between theoretical capabilities of the transformer architecture, and the practical learnability of these capabilities from unsupervised data. We propose tracr-injection, a method that allows us to distill algorithms written in RASP directly into a pre-trained language model. We showcase our method by injecting 3 different algorithms into a language model. We show how our method creates an interpretable subspace within the model's residual stream, which can be decoded into the variables present in the code of the RASP algorithm. Additionally, we found that the proposed method can improve out-of-distribution performance compared to our baseline, indicating that indeed a more symbolic mechanism is taking place in the inner workings of the model. We release the code used to run our experiments.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in morphological inflection tasks, yet their ability to generalize across languages and morphological rules remains limited. One possible explanation for this behavior can be the degree to which these models are able to capture implicit phenomena at the phonological and subphonemic levels. We introduce a language-agnostic probing method to investigate phonological feature encoding in transformers trained directly on phonemes, and perform it across seven morphologically diverse languages. We show that phonological features which are local, such as final-obstruent devoicing in Turkish, are captured well in phoneme embeddings, whereas long-distance dependencies like vowel harmony are better represented in the transformer's encoder. Finally, we discuss how these findings inform empirical strategies for training morphological models, particularly regarding the role of subphonemic feature acquisition.

Abstract: Multimodal reference resolution, including phrase grounding, aims to understand the semantic relations between mentions and real-world objects. Phrase grounding between images and their captions is a well-established task. In contrast, for real-world applications, it is essential to integrate textual and multimodal reference resolution to unravel the reference relations within dialogue, especially in handling ambiguities caused by pronouns and ellipses. This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative models for this task, MDETR and GLIP. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates that incorporating textual reference relations strengthens the confidence scores between mentions, including pronouns and predicates, and objects, which can reduce the ambiguities that arise in visually grounded dialogues.

Abstract: Counterspeech has proven to be a powerful tool to combat hate speech online. Previous studies have focused on generating counterspeech conditioned only on specific intents (single attributed). However, a holistic approach considering multiple attributes simultaneously can yield more nuanced and effective responses. Here, we introduce HiPPrO, Hierarchical Prefix learning with Preference Optimization, a novel two-stage framework that utilizes the effectiveness of attribute-specific prefix embedding spaces hierarchically optimized during the counterspeech generation process in the first phase. Thereafter, we incorporate both reference and reward-free preference optimization to generate more constructive counterspeech. Furthermore, we extend IntentCONANv2 by annotating all 13,973 counterspeech instances with emotion labels by five annotators. HiPPrO leverages hierarchical prefix optimization to integrate these dual attributes effectively. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that HiPPrO achieves a ~38 % improvement in intent conformity and a ~3 %, ~2 %, ~3 % improvement in Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L, respectively, compared to several baseline models. Human evaluations further substantiate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the enhanced relevance and appropriateness of the generated counterspeech. This work underscores the potential of multi-attribute conditioning in advancing the efficacy of counterspeech generation systems. Our code is available on Github and dataset is open-sourced on Hugging-face.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on task-specific data is essential for their effective deployment. As dataset sizes grow, efficiently selecting optimal subsets for training becomes crucial to balancing performance and computational costs. Traditional data selection methods often require fine-tuning a scoring model on the target dataset, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive, or rely on heuristics that fail to fully leverage the model's predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Data Whisperer, an efficient, training-free, attention-based method that leverages few-shot in-context learning with the model to be fine-tuned. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted on both raw and synthetic datasets across diverse tasks and models. Notably, Data Whisperer achieves superior performance compared to the full GSM8K dataset on the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using just 10% of the data, and outperforms existing methods with a 3.1-point improvement and a 7.4$\times$ speedup. The code is available at https://github.com/gszfwsb/Data-Whisperer.

Abstract: Mental-health stigma remains a pervasive social problem that hampers treatment-seeking and recovery. Existing resources for training neural models to finely classify such stigma are limited, relying primarily on social-media or synthetic data without theoretical underpinnings. To remedy this gap, we present an expert-annotated, theory-informed corpus of human-chatbot interviews, comprising 4,141 snippets from 684 participants with documented socio-cultural backgrounds. Our experiments benchmark state-of-the-art neural models and empirically unpack the challenges of stigma detection. This dataset can facilitate research on computationally detecting, neutralizing, and counteracting mental-health stigma. Our corpus is openly available at https://github.com/HanMeng2004/Mental-Health-Stigma-Interview-Corpus.

<title>A3 : an Analytical Low-Rank Approximation Framework for Attention</title>

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance; however, their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\tt A^\tt 3$, a post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\tt A^\tt 3$ splits a Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\tt QK$, $\tt OV$, and $\tt MLP$. For each component, $\tt A^\tt 3$ provides an analytical solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while minimizing the component's functional loss ($\it i.e.$, error in attention scores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces model sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime overheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the optimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward improved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that $\tt A^\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example, under the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank approximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2, outperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the versatility of $\tt A^\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and mixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and languages. In this study, we focus on natural language understanding in three classical languages -- Sanskrit, Ancient Greek and Latin -- to investigate the factors affecting cross-lingual zero-shot generalization. First, we explore named entity recognition and machine translation into English. While LLMs perform equal to or better than fine-tuned baselines on out-of-domain data, smaller models often struggle, especially with niche or abstract entity types. In addition, we concentrate on Sanskrit by presenting a factoid question-answering (QA) dataset and show that incorporating context via retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly boosts performance. In contrast, we observe pronounced performance drops for smaller LLMs across these QA tasks. These results suggest model scale as an important factor influencing cross-lingual generalization. Assuming that models used such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 are not instruction fine-tuned on classical languages, our findings provide insights into how LLMs may generalize on these languages and their consequent utility in classical studies.

Abstract: Taxonomies are hierarchical knowledge graphs crucial for recommendation systems, and web applications. As data grows, expanding taxonomies is essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We propose LORex (Lineage-Oriented Reasoning for Taxonomy Expansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is intrinsically linked to the quality of its training data. Although several studies have proposed methods for high-quality data selection, they do not consider the importance of knowledge richness in text corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel and gradient-free High-Knowledge Scorer (HKS) to select high-quality data from the dimension of knowledge, to alleviate the problem of knowledge scarcity in the pre-trained corpus. We propose a comprehensive multi-domain knowledge element pool and introduce knowledge density and coverage as metrics to assess the knowledge content of the text. Based on this, we propose a comprehensive knowledge scorer to select data with intensive knowledge, which can also be utilized for domain-specific high-knowledge data selection by restricting knowledge elements to the specific domain. We train models on a high-knowledge bilingual dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that our scorer improves the model's performance in knowledge-intensive and general comprehension tasks, and is effective in enhancing both the generic and domain-specific capabilities of the model.

Abstract: Research on holistic Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is long-dated; yet, there is a notable lack of attention for assessing essays according to individual traits. In this work, we propose TRATES, a novel trait-specific and rubric-based cross-prompt AES framework that is generic yet specific to the underlying trait. The framework leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) that utilizes the trait grading rubrics to generate trait-specific features (represented by assessment questions), then assesses those features given an essay. The trait-specific features are eventually combined with generic writing-quality and prompt-specific features to train a simple classical regression model that predicts trait scores of essays from an unseen prompt. Experiments show that TRATES achieves a new state-of-the-art performance across all traits on a widely-used dataset, with the generated LLM-based features being the most significant.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, raising concerns about the unauthorized use of copyrighted or sensitive data. Machine unlearning aims to remove such 'forget' data while preserving utility and information from the 'retain' set. However, existing evaluations typically assume that forget and retain sets are fully disjoint, overlooking realistic scenarios where they share overlapping content. For instance, a news article may need to be unlearned, even though the same event, such as an earthquake in Japan, is also described factually on Wikipedia. Effective unlearning should remove the specific phrasing of the news article while preserving publicly supported facts. In this paper, we introduce DUSK, a benchmark designed to evaluate unlearning methods under realistic data overlap. DUSK constructs document sets that describe the same factual content in different styles, with some shared information appearing across all sets and other content remaining unique to each. When one set is designated for unlearning, an ideal method should remove its unique content while preserving shared facts. We define seven evaluation metrics to assess whether unlearning methods can achieve this selective removal. Our evaluation of nine recent unlearning methods reveals a key limitation: while most can remove surface-level text, they often fail to erase deeper, context-specific knowledge without damaging shared content. We release DUSK as a public benchmark to support the development of more precise and reliable unlearning techniques for real-world applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models.

Abstract: During the finetuning stage of text generation tasks, standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally. This can lead models to overemphasize high-frequency, low-information tokens, neglecting lower-frequency tokens crucial for specificity and informativeness in generated content. This paper introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), specifically designed to optimize the finetuning process for text generation. The core motivation for PDL stems from observations in information theory and linguistics: the informativeness of a token is often inversely proportional to its frequency of occurrence. PDL re-weights the contribution of each token in the standard cross-entropy loss based on its frequency in the training corpus, following a power-law decay. Specifically, the weights for high-frequency tokens are reduced, while low-frequency, information-dense tokens are assigned higher weights. This mechanism guides the model during finetuning to focus more on learning and generating tokens that convey specific and unique information, thereby enhancing the quality, diversity, and informativeness of the generated text. We theoretically elaborate on the motivation and construction of PDL and discuss its potential applications and advantages across various text generation finetuning tasks, such as abstractive summarization, dialogue systems, and style transfer.

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that they may be able to perform as automated talk therapists. It is crucial to know if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking. It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an automated assessment of both the chatbot's adherence to MI and client responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the conversation and one week later. Participants' confidence increased by an average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed adherence to MI standards in 98% of utterances, higher than human counsellors. The chatbot scored well on a participant-reported metric of perceived empathy but lower than typical human counsellors. Furthermore, participants' language indicated a good level of motivation to change, a key goal in MI. These results suggest that the automation of talk therapy with a modern LLM has promise.

Abstract: The purpose of speech tokenization is to transform a speech signal into a sequence of discrete representations, serving as the foundation for speech language models (SLMs). While speech tokenization has many options, their effect on the performance of SLMs remains unclear. This paper investigates two key aspects of speech tokenization: the segmentation width and the cluster size of discrete units. First, we segment speech signals into fixed/variable widths and pooled representations. We then train K-means models in multiple cluster sizes. Through the evaluation on zero-shot spoken language understanding benchmarks, we find the positive effect of moderately coarse segmentation and bigger cluster size. Notably, among the best-performing models, the most efficient one achieves a 50% reduction in training data and a 70% decrease in training runtime. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple tokens to enhance fine-grained spoken language understanding.

Abstract: Conversations are usually structured by roles -- who is speaking, who's being addressed, and who's listening -- and unfold in threads that break with changes in speaker floor or topical focus. While large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible capabilities in dialogue and reasoning, their ability to understand fine-grained conversational structure, especially in multi-modal, multi-party settings, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a suite of tasks focused on conversational role attribution (speaker, addressees, side-participants) and conversation threading (utterance linking and clustering), drawing on conversation analysis and sociolinguistics. To support those tasks, we present a human annotated dataset of 4,398 annotations for speakers and reply-to relationship, 5,755 addressees, and 3,142 side-participants.
  We evaluate popular audio-visual LLMs and vision-language models on our dataset, and our experimental results suggest that multimodal conversational structure understanding remains challenging. The most performant audio-visual LLM outperforms all vision-language models across all metrics, especially in speaker and addressee recognition. However, its performance drops significantly when conversation participants are anonymized. The number of conversation participants in a clip is the strongest negative predictor of role-attribution performance, while acoustic clarity (measured by pitch and spectral centroid) and detected face coverage yield positive associations. We hope this work lays the groundwork for future evaluation and development of multimodal LLMs that can reason more effectively about conversation structure.

Abstract: We introduce a set of training-free ABX-style discrimination tasks to evaluate how multilingual language models represent language identity (form) and semantic content (meaning). Inspired from speech processing, these zero-shot tasks measure whether minimal differences in representation can be reliably detected. This offers a flexible and interpretable alternative to probing. Applied to XLM-R (Conneau et al, 2020) across pretraining checkpoints and layers, we find that language discrimination declines over training and becomes concentrated in lower layers, while meaning discrimination strengthens over time and stabilizes in deeper layers. We then explore probing tasks, showing some alignment between our metrics and linguistic learning performance. Our results position ABX tasks as a lightweight framework for analyzing the structure of multilingual representations.

Abstract: High-quality instruction data is crucial for developing large language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches struggle to effectively control instruction complexity. We present TAG-INSTRUCT, a novel framework that enhances instruction complexity through structured semantic compression and controlled difficulty augmentation. Unlike previous prompt-based methods operating on raw text, TAG-INSTRUCT compresses instructions into a compact tag space and systematically enhances complexity through RL-guided tag expansion. Through extensive experiments, we show that TAG-INSTRUCT outperforms existing instruction complexity augmentation approaches. Our analysis reveals that operating in tag space provides superior controllability and stability across different instruction synthesis frameworks.

Abstract: As online platforms grow, comment sections increasingly host harassment that undermines user experience and well-being. This study benchmarks three leading large language models, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic Claude 3 Opus, on a corpus of 5,080 YouTube comments sampled from high-abuse threads in gaming, lifestyle, food vlog, and music channels. The dataset comprises 1,334 harmful and 3,746 non-harmful messages in English, Arabic, and Indonesian, annotated independently by two reviewers with substantial agreement (Cohen's kappa = 0.83). Using a unified prompt and deterministic settings, GPT-4.1 achieved the best overall balance with an F1 score of 0.863, precision of 0.887, and recall of 0.841. Gemini flagged the highest share of harmful posts (recall = 0.875) but its precision fell to 0.767 due to frequent false positives. Claude delivered the highest precision at 0.920 and the lowest false-positive rate of 0.022, yet its recall dropped to 0.720. Qualitative analysis showed that all three models struggle with sarcasm, coded insults, and mixed-language slang. These results underscore the need for moderation pipelines that combine complementary models, incorporate conversational context, and fine-tune for under-represented languages and implicit abuse. A de-identified version of the dataset and full prompts is publicly released to promote reproducibility and further progress in automated content moderation.

<title>System-1.5 Reasoning: Traversal in Language and Latent Spaces with Dynamic Shortcuts</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to move beyond fast System-1 responses and engage in deliberative System-2 reasoning. However, this comes at the cost of significant inefficiency due to verbose intermediate output. Recent latent-space reasoning methods improve efficiency by operating on hidden states without decoding into language, yet they treat all steps uniformly, failing to distinguish critical deductions from auxiliary steps and resulting in suboptimal use of computational resources. In this paper, we propose System-1.5 Reasoning, an adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically allocates computation across reasoning steps through shortcut paths in latent space. Specifically, System-1.5 Reasoning introduces two types of dynamic shortcuts. The model depth shortcut (DS) adaptively reasons along the vertical depth by early exiting non-critical tokens through lightweight adapter branches, while allowing critical tokens to continue through deeper Transformer layers. The step shortcut (SS) reuses hidden states across the decoding steps to skip trivial steps and reason horizontally in latent space. Training System-1.5 Reasoning involves a two-stage self-distillation process: first distilling natural language CoT into latent-space continuous thought, and then distilling full-path System-2 latent reasoning into adaptive shortcut paths (System-1.5 Reasoning). Experiments on reasoning tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method. For example, on GSM8K, System-1.5 Reasoning achieves reasoning performance comparable to traditional CoT fine-tuning methods while accelerating inference by over 20x and reducing token generation by 92.31% on average.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on natural language tasks, but their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. Existing explanation methods either suffer from limited faithfulness to the model's reasoning or produce explanations that humans find difficult to understand. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ProtoSurE}, a novel prototype-based surrogate framework that provides faithful and human-understandable explanations for LLMs. ProtoSurE trains an interpretable-by-design surrogate model that aligns with the target LLM while utilizing sentence-level prototypes as human-understandable concepts. Extensive experiments show that ProtoSurE consistently outperforms SOTA explanation methods across diverse LLMs and datasets. Importantly, ProtoSurE demonstrates strong data efficiency, requiring relatively few training examples to achieve good performance, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: The increasing number of academic papers poses significant challenges for researchers to efficiently acquire key details. While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g., sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including a self-annotated one AIRQA-REAL, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the vector-based RAG and various structured baselines, highlighting its capacity to unify both retrieval schemes and utilize multiple views. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/X-LANCE/NeuSym-RAG.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large audio-language models for speech translation remains challenging due to their significant computational requirements. In this paper, we address this challenge through our system submissions to the "Model Compression" track at the International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2025). We experiment with a combination of approaches including iterative layer pruning based on layer importance evaluation, low-rank adaptation with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA), and knowledge distillation. In our experiments, we use Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct for speech translation into German and Chinese. Our pruned (student) models achieve up to a 50% reduction in both model parameters and storage footprint, while retaining 97-100% of the translation quality of the in-domain (teacher) models.

Abstract: Time plays a critical role in how information is generated, retrieved, and interpreted. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Temporal Information Retrieval and Temporal Question Answering, two research areas aimed at handling and understanding time-sensitive information. As the amount of time-stamped content from sources like news articles, web archives, and knowledge bases increases, systems must address challenges such as detecting temporal intent, normalizing time expressions, ordering events, and reasoning over evolving or ambiguous facts. These challenges are critical across many dynamic and time-sensitive domains, from news and encyclopedias to science, history, and social media. We review both traditional approaches and modern neural methods, including those that use transformer models and Large Language Models (LLMs). We also review recent advances in temporal language modeling, multi-hop reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), alongside benchmark datasets and evaluation strategies that test temporal robustness, recency awareness, and generalization.

Abstract: Learning distributed representations, or embeddings, that encode the relational similarity patterns among objects is a relevant task in machine learning. A popular method to learn the embedding matrices $X, Y$ is optimizing a loss function of the term ${\rm SoftMax}(XY^T)$. The complexity required to calculate this term, however, runs quadratically with the problem size, making it a computationally heavy solution. In this article, we propose a linear-time heuristic approximation to compute the normalization constants of ${\rm SoftMax}(XY^T)$ for embedding vectors with bounded norms. We show on some pre-trained embedding datasets that the proposed estimation method achieves higher or comparable accuracy with competing methods. From this result, we design an efficient and task-agnostic algorithm that learns the embeddings by optimizing the cross entropy between the softmax and a set of probability distributions given as inputs. The proposed algorithm is interpretable and easily adapted to arbitrary embedding problems. We consider a few use cases and observe similar or higher performances and a lower computational time than similar ``2Vec'' algorithms.

Abstract: Over the last decades, deep neural networks based-models became the dominant paradigm in machine learning. Further, the use of artificial neural networks in symbolic learning has been seen as increasingly relevant recently. To study the capabilities of neural networks in the symbolic AI domain, researchers have explored the ability of deep neural networks to learn mathematical constructions, such as addition and multiplication, logic inference, such as theorem provers, and even the execution of computer programs. The latter is known to be too complex a task for neural networks. Therefore, the results were not always successful, and often required the introduction of biased elements in the learning process, in addition to restricting the scope of possible programs to be executed. In this work, we will analyze the ability of neural networks to learn how to execute programs as a whole. To do so, we propose a different approach. Instead of using an imperative programming language, with complex structures, we use the Lambda Calculus ({\lambda}-Calculus), a simple, but Turing-Complete mathematical formalism, which serves as the basis for modern functional programming languages and is at the heart of computability theory. We will introduce the use of integrated neural learning and lambda calculi formalization. Finally, we explore execution of a program in {\lambda}-Calculus is based on reductions, we will show that it is enough to learn how to perform these reductions so that we can execute any program.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are vital for modern image rendering due to their scalability and versatility. Previous SVG generation methods have focused on curve-based vectorization, lacking semantic understanding, often producing artifacts, and struggling with SVG primitives beyond path curves. To address these issues, we introduce StarVector, a multimodal large language model for SVG generation. It performs image vectorization by understanding image semantics and using SVG primitives for compact, precise outputs. Unlike traditional methods, StarVector works directly in the SVG code space, leveraging visual understanding to apply accurate SVG primitives. To train StarVector, we create SVG-Stack, a diverse dataset of 2M samples that enables generalization across vectorization tasks and precise use of primitives like ellipses, polygons, and text. We address challenges in SVG evaluation, showing that pixel-based metrics like MSE fail to capture the unique qualities of vector graphics. We introduce SVG-Bench, a benchmark across 10 datasets, and 3 tasks: Image-to-SVG, Text-to-SVG generation, and diagram generation. Using this setup, StarVector achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more compact and semantically rich SVGs.

Abstract: Creating lyrics and melodies for the vocal track in a symbolic format, known as song composition, demands expert musical knowledge of melody, an advanced understanding of lyrics, and precise alignment between them. Despite achievements in sub-tasks such as lyric generation, lyric-to-melody, and melody-to-lyric, etc, a unified model for song composition has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we introduce SongComposer, a pioneering step towards a unified song composition model that can readily create symbolic lyrics and melodies following instructions. SongComposer is a music-specialized large language model (LLM) that, for the first time, integrates the capability of simultaneously composing lyrics and melodies into LLMs by leveraging three key innovations: 1) a flexible tuple format for word-level alignment of lyrics and melodies, 2) an extended tokenizer vocabulary for song notes, with scalar initialization based on musical knowledge to capture rhythm, and 3) a multi-stage pipeline that captures musical structure, starting with motif-level melody patterns and progressing to phrase-level structure for improved coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SongComposer outperforms advanced LLMs, including GPT-4, in tasks such as lyric-to-melody generation, melody-to-lyric generation, song continuation, and text-to-song creation. Moreover, we will release SongCompose, a large-scale dataset for training, containing paired lyrics and melodies in Chinese and English.

Abstract: A brief, fluent, and relevant summary can be helpful during program comprehension; however, such a summary does require significant human effort to produce. Often, good summaries are unavailable in software projects, which makes maintenance more difficult. There has been a considerable body of research into automated AI-based methods, using Large Language models (LLMs), to generate summaries of code; there also has been quite a bit of work on ways to measure the performance of such summarization methods, with special attention paid to how closely these AI-generated summaries resemble a summary a human might have produced. Measures such as BERTScore and BLEU have been suggested and evaluated with human-subject studies.
  However, LLM-generated summaries can be inaccurate, incomplete, etc.: generally, too dissimilar to one that a good developer might write. Given an LLM-generated code summary, how can a user rationally judge if a summary is sufficiently good and reliable? Given just some input source code, and an LLM-generated summary, existing approaches can help judge brevity, fluency and relevance of the summary; however, it's difficult to gauge whether an LLM-generated summary sufficiently resembles what a human might produce, without a "golden" human-produced summary to compare against. We study this resemblance question as calibration problem: given just the code & the summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, that provides a reliable indication of whether the summary sufficiently resembles what a human would have produced in this situation? We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings. Our investigation suggests approaches to provide reliable predictions of the likelihood that an LLM-generated summary would sufficiently resemble a summary a human might write for the same code.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain widespread use, establishing systematic and reliable evaluation methodologies for LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs) has become essential to ensure their real-world effectiveness and reliability. There have been some early explorations about the usability of LLMs for limited urban tasks, but a systematic and scalable evaluation benchmark is still lacking. The challenge in constructing a systematic evaluation benchmark for urban research lies in the diversity of urban data, the complexity of application scenarios and the highly dynamic nature of the urban environment. In this paper, we design \textit{CityBench}, an interactive simulator based evaluation platform, as the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLMs for diverse tasks in urban research. First, we build \textit{CityData} to integrate the diverse urban data and \textit{CitySimu} to simulate fine-grained urban dynamics. Based on \textit{CityData} and \textit{CitySimu}, we design 8 representative urban tasks in 2 categories of perception-understanding and decision-making as the \textit{CityBench}. With extensive results from 30 well-known LLMs and VLMs in 13 cities around the world, we find that advanced LLMs and VLMs can achieve competitive performance in diverse urban tasks requiring commonsense and semantic understanding abilities, e.g., understanding the human dynamics and semantic inference of urban images. Meanwhile, they fail to solve the challenging urban tasks requiring professional knowledge and high-level numerical abilities, e.g., geospatial prediction and traffic control task.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs), with their powerful language generation and reasoning capabilities, have already achieved notable success in many domains, e.g., math and code generation. However, they often fall short when tackling real-life geospatial tasks within urban environments. This limitation stems from a lack of physical world knowledge and relevant data during training. To address this gap, we propose \textit{CityGPT}, a systematic framework designed to enhance LLMs' understanding of urban space and improve their ability to solve the related urban tasks by integrating a city-scale `world model' into the model. Firstly, we construct a diverse instruction tuning dataset, \textit{CityInstruction}, for injecting urban knowledge into LLMs and effectively boosting their spatial reasoning capabilities. Using a combination of \textit{CityInstruction} and open source general instruction data, we introduce a novel and easy-to-use self-weighted fine-tuning method (\textit{SWFT}) to train various LLMs (including ChatGLM3-6B, Llama3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B) to enhance their urban spatial capabilities without compromising, or even improving, their general abilities. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we develop a comprehensive text-based spatial benchmark \textit{CityEval} for evaluating the performance of LLMs across a wide range of urban scenarios and geospatial tasks. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that smaller LLMs trained with \textit{CityInstruction} by \textit{SWFT} method can achieve performance that is competitive with, and in some cases superior to, proprietary LLMs when assessed using \textit{CityEval}.

Abstract: The impressive multimodal capabilities demonstrated by OpenAI's GPT-4 have generated significant interest in the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Visual instruction tuning of MLLMs with machine-generated instruction-following data has shown to enhance zero-shot capabilities across various tasks. However, there has been limited exploration into controlling the quality of the instruction data.Current methodologies for data selection in MLLMs often rely on single, unreliable scores or use downstream tasks for selection, which is time-consuming and can lead to potential overfitting on the chosen evaluation datasets. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel data selection methodology that utilizes image-text correlation and model perplexity to evaluate and select data of varying quality. This approach leverages the distinct distribution of these two attributes, mapping data quality into a two-dimensional space that allows for the selection of data based on their location within this distribution. By utilizing this space, we can analyze the impact of task type settings, used as prompts, on data quality. Additionally, this space can be used to construct multi-stage subsets of varying quality to facilitate curriculum learning. Our research includes comprehensive experiments conducted on various datasets. The results emphasize substantial enhancements in five commonly assessed capabilities compared to using the complete dataset. Our codes, data, and models are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EHIT-31B4

Abstract: Recent advancements in language modeling have shown promising results when applied to time series data. In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a text embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on a well-established time series classification benchmark. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging text embedding models to encode time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) allows models to learn interactively from user feedback. This paper introduces a counterfactual data augmentation approach to AL, particularly addressing the selection of datapoints for user querying, a pivotal concern in enhancing data efficiency. Our approach is inspired by Variation Theory, a theory of human concept learning that emphasizes the essential features of a concept by focusing on what stays the same and what changes. Instead of just querying with existing datapoints, our approach synthesizes artificial datapoints that highlight potential key similarities and differences among labels using a neuro-symbolic pipeline combining large language models (LLMs) and rule-based models. Through an experiment in the example domain of text classification, we show that our approach achieves significantly higher performance when there are fewer annotated data. As the annotated training data gets larger the impact of the generated data starts to diminish showing its capability to address the cold start problem in AL. This research sheds light on integrating theories of human learning into the optimization of AL.

Abstract: Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS) is a service offered by large language model (LLM) developers to supply embeddings generated by LLMs. Previous research suggests that EaaS is prone to imitation attacks -- attacks that clone the underlying EaaS model by training another model on the queried embeddings. As a result, EaaS watermarks are introduced to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers. In this paper, we first show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed by paraphrasing when attackers clone the model. Subsequently, we propose a novel watermarking technique that involves linearly transforming the embeddings, and show that it is empirically and theoretically robust against paraphrasing.

Abstract: Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional and intentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions. Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.

Abstract: LLM inference for enterprise applications, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observe much longer prompt than generations, leading to high prefill cost and response latency. We present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure targeted at reducing the prefill compute (in FLOPs) of prompt tokens while preserving high generation quality. First, SwiftKV prefills later layers' KV cache using an earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip those later layers. Second, SwiftKV employs a lightweight knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs with minimal accuracy impact. Third, SwiftKV can naturally incorporate KV cache compression to improve inference performance in low-memory scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments show that SwiftKV can effectively reduce prefill computation by 25-50% across several LLM families while incurring minimum quality degradation. In the end-to-end inference serving, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B. SwiftKV is open-sourced at https://github.com/snowflakedb/arctictraining.

Scientometrics, the quantitative and qualitative study of scientific literature, provides valuable insights into these processes. We introduce SciEvo, a longitudinal scientometric dataset with over two million academic publications, providing comprehensive contents information and citation graphs to support cross-disciplinary analyses. SciEvo is easy to use and available across platforms, including GitHub, Kaggle, and HuggingFace. Using SciEvo, we conduct a temporal study spanning over 30 years to explore key questions in scientometrics: the evolution of academic terminology, citation patterns, and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. Our findings reveal critical insights, such as disparities in epistemic cultures, knowledge production modes, and citation practices. For example, rapidly developing, application-driven fields like LLMs exhibit significantly shorter citation age (2.48 years) compared to traditional theoretical disciplines like oral history (9.71 years). Our data and analytic tools can be accessed at https://github.com/Ahren09/SciEvo.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a challenging task, particularly in the context of complex multiscale temporal patterns. This study presents LLM-Mixer, a framework that improves forecasting accuracy through the combination of multiscale time-series decomposition with pre-trained LLMs (Large Language Models). LLM-Mixer captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends by decomposing the data into multiple temporal resolutions and processing them with a frozen LLM, guided by a textual prompt specifically designed for time-series data. Extensive experiments conducted on multivariate and univariate datasets demonstrate that LLM-Mixer achieves competitive performance, outperforming recent state-of-the-art models across various forecasting horizons. This work highlights the potential of combining multiscale analysis and LLMs for effective and scalable time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods typically assume that Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on data from a single device or client. However, real-world scenarios often require fine-tuning these models on private data distributed across multiple devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers an appealing solution by preserving user privacy, as sensitive data remains on local devices during training. Nonetheless, integrating PEFT methods into FL introduces two main challenges: communication overhead and data heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce FedTT and FedTT+, methods for adapting LLMs by integrating tensorized adapters into client-side models' encoder/decoder blocks. FedTT is versatile and can be applied to both cross-silo FL and large-scale cross-device FL. FedTT+, an extension of FedTT tailored for cross-silo FL, enhances robustness against data heterogeneity by adaptively freezing portions of tensor factors, further reducing the number of trainable parameters. Experiments on BERT and LLaMA models demonstrate that our proposed methods successfully address data heterogeneity challenges and perform on par or even better than existing federated PEFT approaches while achieving up to 10$\times$ reduction in communication cost.

Abstract: Recent research on explainable recommendation generally frames the task as a standard text generation problem, and evaluates models simply based on the textual similarity between the predicted and ground-truth explanations. However, this approach fails to consider one crucial aspect of the systems: whether their outputs accurately reflect the users' (post-purchase) sentiments, i.e., whether and why they would like and/or dislike the recommended items. To shed light on this issue, we introduce new datasets and evaluation methods that focus on the users' sentiments. Specifically, we construct the datasets by explicitly extracting users' positive and negative opinions from their post-purchase reviews using an LLM, and propose to evaluate systems based on whether the generated explanations 1) align well with the users' sentiments, and 2) accurately identify both positive and negative opinions of users on the target items. We benchmark several recent models on our datasets and demonstrate that achieving strong performance on existing metrics does not ensure that the generated explanations align well with the users' sentiments. Lastly, we find that existing models can provide more sentiment-aware explanations when the users' (predicted) ratings for the target items are directly fed into the models as input. The datasets and benchmark implementation are available at: https://github.com/jchanxtarov/sent_xrec.

Abstract: Visual Question Answer (VQA) poses the problem of answering a natural language question about a visual context. Bangla, despite being a widely spoken language, is considered low-resource in the realm of VQA due to the lack of proper benchmarks, challenging models known to be performant in other languages. Furthermore, existing Bangla VQA datasets offer little regional relevance and are largely adapted from their foreign counterparts. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale Bangla VQA dataset, ChitroJera, totaling over 15k samples from diverse and locally relevant data sources. We assess the performance of text encoders, image encoders, multimodal models, and our novel dual-encoder models. The experiments reveal that the pre-trained dual-encoders outperform other models of their scale. We also evaluate the performance of current large vision language models (LVLMs) using prompt-based techniques, achieving the overall best performance. Given the underdeveloped state of existing datasets, we envision ChitroJera expanding the scope of Vision-Language tasks in Bangla.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) is critical for removing private or hazardous information from deep learning models. While MU has advanced significantly in unimodal (text or vision) settings, multimodal unlearning (MMU) remains underexplored due to the lack of open benchmarks for evaluating cross-modal data removal. To address this gap, we introduce CLEAR, the first open-source benchmark designed specifically for MMU. CLEAR contains 200 fictitious individuals and 3,700 images linked with corresponding question-answer pairs, enabling a thorough evaluation across modalities. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of 11 MU methods (e.g., SCRUB, gradient ascent, DPO) across four evaluation sets, demonstrating that jointly unlearning both modalities outperforms single-modality approaches. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/therem/CLEAR

Abstract: Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey.

<title>Probing LLM Hallucination from Within: Perturbation-Driven Approach via Internal Knowledge</title>

Abstract: LLM hallucination, where unfaithful text is generated, presents a critical challenge for LLMs' practical applications. Current detection methods often resort to external knowledge, LLM fine-tuning, or supervised training with large hallucination-labeled datasets. Moreover, these approaches do not distinguish between different types of hallucinations, which is crucial for enhancing detection performance. To address such limitations, we introduce hallucination probing, a new task that classifies LLM-generated text into three categories: aligned, misaligned, and fabricated. Driven by our novel discovery that perturbing key entities in prompts affects LLM's generation of these three types of text differently, we propose SHINE, a novel hallucination probing method that does not require external knowledge, supervised training, or LLM fine-tuning. SHINE is effective in hallucination probing across three modern LLMs, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in hallucination detection, outperforming seven competing methods across four datasets and four LLMs, underscoring the importance of probing for accurate detection.

<title>VL-RewardBench: A Challenging Benchmark for Vision-Language Generative Reward Models</title>

Abstract: Vision-language generative reward models (VL-GenRMs) play a crucial role in aligning and evaluating multimodal AI systems, yet their own evaluation remains under-explored. Current assessment methods primarily rely on AI-annotated preference labels from traditional VL tasks, which can introduce biases and often fail to effectively challenge state-of-the-art models. To address these limitations, we introduce VL-RewardBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning general multimodal queries, visual hallucination detection, and complex reasoning tasks. Through our AI-assisted annotation pipeline that combines sample selection with human verification, we curate 1,250 high-quality examples specifically designed to probe VL-GenRMs limitations. Comprehensive evaluation across 16 leading large vision-language models demonstrates VL-RewardBench's effectiveness as a challenging testbed, where even GPT-4o achieves only 65.4% accuracy, and state-of-the-art open-source models such as Qwen2-VL-72B, struggle to surpass random-guessing. Importantly, performance on VL-RewardBench strongly correlates (Pearson's r $>$ 0.9) with MMMU-Pro accuracy using Best-of-N sampling with VL-GenRMs. Analysis experiments uncover three critical insights for improving VL-GenRMs: (i) models predominantly fail at basic visual perception tasks rather than reasoning tasks; (ii) inference-time scaling benefits vary dramatically by model capacity; and (iii) training VL-GenRMs to learn to judge substantially boosts judgment capability (+14.7% accuracy for a 7B VL-GenRM). We believe VL-RewardBench along with the experimental insights will become a valuable resource for advancing VL-GenRMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has shown remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant disparity exists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We attribute this gap primarily to current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, especially in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are essential. In this paper, we introduce G-Pass@$k$, a novel evaluation metric that continuously assesses model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's performance potential and its stability. Through extensive experiments on various public and newly constructed benchmarks, we employ G-Pass@$k$ in conjunction with state-of-the-art large language models to provide comprehensive insights into their potential capabilities and operational consistency. Our findings reveal a significant opportunity to enhance the realistic reasoning abilities of LLMs, underscoring the necessity for more robust evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities in LLMs have recently become a central object of investigation. Cognitive science distinguishes between two steps required for ToM tasks: 1) determine whether to invoke ToM, which includes the appropriate Depth of Mentalizing (DoM), or level of recursion required to complete a task; and 2) applying the correct inference given the DoM. In this position paper, we first identify several lines of work in different communities in AI, including LLM benchmarking, ToM add-ons, ToM probing, and formal models for ToM. We argue that recent work in AI tends to focus exclusively on the second step which are typically framed as static logic problems. We conclude with suggestions for improved evaluation of ToM capabilities inspired by dynamic environments used in cognitive tasks.

<title>Are We in the AI-Generated Text World Already? Quantifying and Monitoring AIGT on Social Media</title>

Abstract: Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, it remains unclear how prevalent AIGTs are on social media. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify and monitor the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024, using the AI Attribution Rate (AAR) as the metric. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs on social media differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain.

Abstract: Medical imaging provides essential visual insights for diagnosis, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly utilized for its analysis due to their strong generalization capabilities; however, the underlying factors driving this generalization remain unclear. Current research suggests that multi-task training outperforms single-task as different tasks can benefit each other, but they often overlook the internal relationships within these tasks. To analyze this phenomenon, we attempted to employ compositional generalization (CG), which refers to the models' ability to understand novel combinations by recombining learned elements, as a guiding framework. Since medical images can be precisely defined by Modality, Anatomical area, and Task, naturally providing an environment for exploring CG, we assembled 106 medical datasets to create Med-MAT for comprehensive experiments. The experiments confirmed that MLLMs can use CG to understand unseen medical images and identified CG as one of the main drivers of the generalization observed in multi-task training. Additionally, further studies demonstrated that CG effectively supports datasets with limited data and confirmed that MLLMs can achieve CG across classification and detection tasks, underscoring its broader generalization potential. Med-MAT is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/Med-MAT.

<title>Why Are Positional Encodings Nonessential for Deep Autoregressive Transformers? Revisiting a Petroglyph</title>

Abstract: Do autoregressive Transformer language models require explicit positional encodings (PEs)? The answer is 'no' provided they have more than one layer -- they can distinguish sequences with permuted tokens without the need for explicit PEs. This follows from the fact that a cascade of (permutation invariant) set processors can collectively exhibit sequence-sensitive behavior in the autoregressive setting. This property has been known since early efforts (contemporary with GPT-2) adopting the Transformer for language modeling. However, this result does not appear to have been well disseminated, leading to recent rediscoveries. This may be partially due to a sudden growth of the language modeling community after the advent of GPT-2/3, but perhaps also due to the lack of a clear explanation in prior work, despite being commonly understood by practitioners in the past. Here we review the long-forgotten explanation why explicit PEs are nonessential for multi-layer autoregressive Transformers (in contrast, one-layer models require PEs to discern order information of their inputs), as well as the origin of this result, and hope to re-establish it as a common knowledge.

<title>Generalizing from SIMPLE to HARD Visual Reasoning: Can We Mitigate Modality Imbalance in VLMs?</title>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are impressive at visual question answering and image captioning. But they underperform on multi-step visual reasoning -- even compared to LLMs on the same tasks presented in text form -- giving rise to perceptions of modality imbalance or brittleness. Towards a systematic study of such issues, we introduce a synthetic framework for assessing the ability of VLMs to perform algorithmic visual reasoning, comprising three tasks: Table Readout, Grid Navigation, and Visual Analogy. Each has two levels of difficulty, SIMPLE and HARD, and even the SIMPLE versions are difficult for frontier VLMs. We propose strategies for training on the SIMPLE version of tasks that improve performance on the corresponding HARD task, i.e., simple-to-hard (S2H) generalization. This controlled setup, where each task also has an equivalent text-only version, allows a quantification of the modality imbalance and how it is impacted by training strategy. We show that 1) explicit image-to-text conversion is important in promoting S2H generalization on images, by transferring reasoning from text; 2) conversion can be internalized at test time. We also report results of mechanistic study of this phenomenon. We identify measures of gradient alignment that can identify training strategies that promote better S2H generalization. Ablations highlight the importance of chain-of-thought.

Abstract: In Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), pre-training and evaluation are resource intensive. In the speech domain, current indicators of the quality of SSL models during pre-training, such as the loss, do not correlate well with downstream performance. Consequently, it is often difficult to gauge the final downstream performance in a cost efficient manner during pre-training. In this work, we propose unsupervised efficient methods that give insights into the quality of the pre-training of SSL speech models, namely, measuring the cluster quality and rank of the embeddings of the SSL model. Results show that measures of cluster quality and rank correlate better with downstream performance than the pre-training loss with only one hour of unlabeled audio, reducing the need for GPU hours and labeled data in SSL model evaluation.

Abstract: Effective decision-making and problem-solving in conversational systems require the ability to identify and acquire missing information through targeted questioning. A key challenge lies in efficiently narrowing down a large space of possible outcomes by posing questions that minimize uncertainty. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate information-seeking questions, with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to strategically select questions that maximize information gain, as a part of inference-time planning. Our primary contribution includes a hierarchical feedback mechanism that exploits past interaction patterns to guide future strategy. Specifically, each new problem is mapped to a cluster based on semantic similarity, and our UCT (Upper Confidence bound for Trees) formulation employs a cluster-specific bonus reward to prioritize successful question trajectories that have proven effective for similar problems in the past. Extensive empirical evaluation across medical diagnosis and technical troubleshooting domains shows that our method achieves an average of 12% improvement in success rates and about 10x reduction in the number of LLM calls made for planning per conversation, compared to the state of the art. An additional 8% gain in success rate is observed on average when we start with a constrained set of possibilities. Our results underscore the efficacy of feedback-aware MCTS in enhancing information-seeking in goal-oriented dialogues.

Abstract: The rapid increase in the parameter counts of Large Language Models (LLMs), reaching billions or even trillions, presents significant challenges for their practical deployment, particularly in resource-constrained environments. To ease this issue, we propose PIP (Perturbation-based Iterative Pruning), a novel double-view structured pruning method to optimize LLMs, which combines information from two different views: the unperturbed view and the perturbed view. With the calculation of gradient differences, PIP iteratively prunes those that struggle to distinguish between these two views. Our experiments show that PIP reduces the parameter count by approximately 20% while retaining over 85% of the original model's accuracy across varied benchmarks. In some cases, the performance of the pruned model is within 5% of the unpruned version, demonstrating PIP's ability to preserve key aspects of model effectiveness. Moreover, PIP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) structured pruning methods, establishing it as a leading technique for optimizing LLMs in environments with constrained resources.

Abstract: Current speech encoding pipelines often rely on an additional text-based LM to get robust representations of human communication, even though SotA speech-to-text models often have a LM within. This work proposes an approach to improve the LM within an audio model such that the subsequent text-LM is unnecessary. We introduce WhiSPA (Whisper with Semantic and Psychological Alignment), which leverages a novel audio training objective: contrastive loss with a language model embedding as a teacher. Using over 500k speech segments from mental health audio interviews, we evaluate the utility of aligning Whisper's latent space with semantic representations from a text autoencoder (SBERT) and lexically derived embeddings of basic psychological dimensions: emotion and personality. Over self-supervised affective tasks and downstream psychological tasks, WhiSPA surpasses current speech encoders, achieving an average error reduction of 73.4% and 83.8%, respectively. WhiSPA demonstrates that it is not always necessary to run a subsequent text LM on speech-to-text output in order to get a rich psychological representation of human communication.

Abstract: We present a novel class of jailbreak adversarial attacks on LLMs, termed Task-in-Prompt (TIP) attacks. Our approach embeds sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., cipher decoding, riddles, code execution) into the model's prompt to indirectly generate prohibited inputs. To systematically assess the effectiveness of these attacks, we introduce the PHRYGE benchmark. We demonstrate that our techniques successfully circumvent safeguards in six state-of-the-art language models, including GPT-4o and LLaMA 3.2. Our findings highlight critical weaknesses in current LLM safety alignments and underscore the urgent need for more sophisticated defence strategies.
  Warning: this paper contains examples of unethical inquiries used solely for research purposes.

Abstract: KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we theoretically analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is generally more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 21.25\% compared with KIVI-KV8 quantization over various context lengths.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.

<title>Bone Soups: A Seek-and-Soup Model Merging Approach for Controllable Multi-Objective Generation</title>

Abstract: User information needs are often highly diverse and varied. A key challenge in current research is how to achieve controllable multi-objective generation while enabling rapid adaptation to accommodate diverse user demands during test time. Existing solutions, such as Rewarded Soup, focus on merging language models individually tuned on single objectives. While easy to implement and widely used, these approaches face limitations in achieving optimal performance due to their disregard for the impacts of competing objectives on model tuning. To address this issue, we propose Bone Soup, a novel model merging approach that first seeks a series of backbone models by considering the impacts of multiple objectives and then makes the soup (i.e., merge the backbone models). Specifically, Bone Soup begins by training multiple backbone models for different objectives using multi-objective reinforcement learning. Each backbone model is guided by a combination of backbone reward signals. To ensure that these models are optimal for the Pareto front, the backbone rewards are crafted by combining standard reward functions into basis vectors, which can then be modified through a rule-based construction method. Bone Soup leverages a symmetric circulant matrix mapping to generate the merging coefficients, which are used to merge the backbone models according to user preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Bone Soup exhibits strong controllability and Pareto optimality in controllable multi-objective generation, providing a more effective and efficient approach to addressing diverse user needs at test time.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in specialized fields such as finance, law, and medicine. However, in cybersecurity, we have noticed a lack of open-source datasets, with a particular lack of high-quality cybersecurity pretraining corpora, even though much research indicates that LLMs acquire their knowledge during pretraining. To address this, we present a comprehensive suite of datasets covering all major training stages, including pretraining, instruction fine-tuning, and reasoning distillation with cybersecurity-specific self-reflection data. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate their effectiveness on public cybersecurity benchmarks. In particular, continual pre-training on our dataset yields a 15.88% improvement in the aggregate score, while reasoning distillation leads to a 10% gain in security certification (CISSP). We will release all datasets and trained cybersecurity LLMs under the ODC-BY and MIT licenses to encourage further research in the community.

<title>How Do LLMs Acquire New Knowledge? A Knowledge Circuits Perspective on Continual Pre-Training</title>

Abstract: Despite exceptional capabilities in knowledge-intensive tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical gap in understanding how they internalize new knowledge, particularly how to structurally embed acquired knowledge in their neural computations. We address this issue through the lens of knowledge circuit evolution, identifying computational subgraphs that facilitate knowledge storage and processing. Our systematic analysis of circuit evolution throughout continual pre-training reveals several key findings: (1) the acquisition of new knowledge is influenced by its relevance to pre-existing knowledge; (2) the evolution of knowledge circuits exhibits a distinct phase shift from formation to optimization; (3) the evolution of knowledge circuits follows a deep-to-shallow pattern. These insights not only advance our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of new knowledge acquisition in LLMs, but also provide potential implications for improving continual pre-training strategies to enhance model performance. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/DynamicKnowledgeCircuits.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has been a powerful paradigm for improving model efficiency and performance by selecting the most informative data points for labeling and training. In recent active learning frameworks, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed not only for selection but also for generating entirely new data instances and providing more cost-effective annotations. Motivated by the increasing importance of high-quality data and efficient model training in the era of LLMs, we present a comprehensive survey on LLM-based Active Learning. We introduce an intuitive taxonomy that categorizes these techniques and discuss the transformative roles LLMs can play in the active learning loop. We further examine the impact of AL on LLM learning paradigms and its applications across various domains. Finally, we identify open challenges and propose future research directions. This survey aims to serve as an up-to-date resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to gain an intuitive understanding of LLM-based AL techniques and deploy them to new applications.

<title>AdaptiveStep: Automatically Dividing Reasoning Step through Model Confidence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.13943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current approaches for training Process Reward Models (PRMs) often involve breaking down responses into multiple reasoning steps using rule-based techniques, such as using predefined placeholder tokens or setting the reasoning step's length into a fixed size. These approaches overlook the fact that specific words do not typically mark true decision points in a text. To address this, we propose AdaptiveStep, a method that divides reasoning steps based on the model's confidence in predicting the next word. This division method provides more decision-making information at each step, enhancing downstream tasks, such as reward model learning. Moreover, our method does not require manual annotation. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with AdaptiveStep-trained PRMs in mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Experimental results indicate that the outcome PRM achieves state-of-the-art Best-of-N performance, surpassing greedy search strategy with token-level value-guided decoding, while also reducing construction costs by over 30% compared to existing open-source PRMs. In addition, we provide a thorough analysis and case study on the PRM's performance, transferability, and generalization capabilities.

<title>Standard Benchmarks Fail - Auditing LLM Agents in Finance Must Prioritize Risk</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15865</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.15865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard benchmarks fixate on how well large language model (LLM) agents perform in finance, yet say little about whether they are safe to deploy. We argue that accuracy metrics and return-based scores provide an illusion of reliability, overlooking vulnerabilities such as hallucinated facts, stale data, and adversarial prompt manipulation. We take a firm position: financial LLM agents should be evaluated first and foremost on their risk profile, not on their point-estimate performance. Drawing on risk-engineering principles, we outline a three-level agenda: model, workflow, and system, for stress-testing LLM agents under realistic failure modes. To illustrate why this shift is urgent, we audit six API-based and open-weights LLM agents on three high-impact tasks and uncover hidden weaknesses that conventional benchmarks miss. We conclude with actionable recommendations for researchers, practitioners, and regulators: audit risk-aware metrics in future studies, publish stress scenarios alongside datasets, and treat ``safety budget'' as a primary success criterion. Only by redefining what ``good'' looks like can the community responsibly advance AI-driven finance.

<title>From Perceptions to Decisions: Wildfire Evacuation Decision Prediction with Behavioral Theory-informed LLMs</title>

Abstract: Evacuation decision prediction is critical for efficient and effective wildfire response by helping emergency management anticipate traffic congestion and bottlenecks, allocate resources, and minimize negative impacts. Traditional statistical methods for evacuation decision prediction fail to capture the complex and diverse behavioral logic of different individuals. In this work, for the first time, we introduce FLARE, short for facilitating LLM for advanced reasoning on wildfire evacuation decision prediction, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework that integrates behavioral theories and models to streamline the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and subsequently integrate with memory-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) module to provide accurate evacuation decision prediction and understanding. Our proposed method addresses the limitations of using existing LLMs for evacuation behavioral predictions, such as limited survey data, mismatching with behavioral theory, conflicting individual preferences, implicit and complex mental states, and intractable mental state-behavior mapping. Experiments on three post-wildfire survey datasets show an average of 20.47% performance improvement over traditional theory-informed behavioral models, with strong cross-event generalizability.

<title>ZEBRA: Leveraging Model-Behavioral Knowledge for Zero-Annotation Preference Dataset Construction</title>

arXiv:2502.18744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts in LLM alignment have focused on constructing large-scale preference datasets via human or Artificial Intelligence (AI) annotators. However, such approaches rely on instance-wise supervision, incurring substantial annotation cost and limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose ZEBRA - a model behavior-wise zero-annotation framework that constructs preference data by leveraging model behavior knowledge derived from benchmark performances. ZEBRA binarizes response pairs by evaluating the quality and similarity of their origin models, entirely bypassing instance-level annotation. This allows scalable, controllable, and cost-effective alignment data generation. Empirical results show that ZEBRA achieves alignment performance comparable to instance-supervised methods, despite requiring no manual or model-based labeling.

<title>Tokens for Learning, Tokens for Unlearning: Mitigating Membership Inference Attacks in Large Language Models via Dual-Purpose Training</title>

arXiv:2502.19726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the backbone of modern natural language processing but pose privacy concerns about leaking sensitive training data. Membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a sample is included in a model's training dataset, can serve as a foundation for broader privacy threats. Existing defenses designed for traditional classification models do not account for the sequential nature of text data. As a result, they either require significant computational resources or fail to effectively mitigate privacy risks in LLMs. In this work, we propose \methodname, a lightweight yet effective empirical privacy defense for protecting training data of language models by leveraging token-specific characteristics. By analyzing token dynamics during training, we propose a token selection strategy that categorizes tokens into hard tokens for learning and memorized tokens for unlearning. Subsequently, our training-phase defense optimizes a novel dual-purpose token-level loss to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between utility and privacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only provides strong protection against MIAs but also improves language modeling performance by around 10\% across various LLM architectures and datasets compared to the baselines.

<title>OmniRouter: Budget and Performance Controllable Multi-LLM Routing</title>

arXiv:2502.20576v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver superior performance but require substantial computational resources and operate with relatively low efficiency, while smaller models can efficiently handle simpler tasks with fewer resources. LLM routing is a crucial paradigm that dynamically selects the most suitable large language models from a pool of candidates to process diverse inputs, ensuring optimal resource utilization while maintaining response quality. Existing routing frameworks typically model this as a locally optimal decision-making problem, selecting the presumed best-fit LLM for each query individually, which overlook global budget constraints, resulting in ineffective resource allocation. To tackle this problem, we introduce OmniRouter, a fundamentally controllable routing framework for multi-LLM serving. Instead of making per-query greedy choices, OmniRouter models the routing task as a constrained optimization problem, assigning models that minimize total cost while ensuring the required performance level. Specifically, a hybrid retrieval-augmented predictor is designed to predict the capabilities and costs of LLMs and a constrained optimizer is employed to control globally optimal query-model allocation. Experiments show that OmniRouter achieves up to 6.30% improvement in response accuracy while simultaneously reducing computational costs by at least 10.15% compared to competitive router baselines. The code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/OmniRouter.

arXiv:2503.00071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In face-to-face interaction, we use multiple modalities, including speech and gestures, to communicate information and resolve references to objects. However, how representational co-speech gestures refer to objects remains understudied from a computational perspective. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a multimodal reference resolution task centred on representational gestures, while simultaneously tackling the challenge of learning robust gesture embeddings. We propose a self-supervised pre-training approach to gesture representation learning that grounds body movements in spoken language. Our experiments show that the learned embeddings align with expert annotations and have significant predictive power. Moreover, reference resolution accuracy further improves when (1) using multimodal gesture representations, even when speech is unavailable at inference time, and (2) leveraging dialogue history. Overall, our findings highlight the complementary roles of gesture and speech in reference resolution, offering a step towards more naturalistic models of human-machine interaction.

<title>Semantic Integrity Constraints: Declarative Guardrails for AI-Augmented Data Processing Systems</title>

arXiv:2503.00600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-augmented data processing systems (DPSs) integrate large language models (LLMs) into query pipelines, allowing powerful semantic operations on structured and unstructured data. However, the reliability (a.k.a. trust) of these systems is fundamentally challenged by the potential for LLMs to produce errors, limiting their adoption in critical domains. To help address this reliability bottleneck, we introduce semantic integrity constraints (SICs) -- a declarative abstraction for specifying and enforcing correctness conditions over LLM outputs in semantic queries. SICs generalize traditional database integrity constraints to semantic settings, supporting common types of constraints, such as grounding, soundness, and exclusion, with both proactive and reactive enforcement strategies.
  We argue that SICs provide a foundation for building reliable and auditable AI-augmented data systems. Specifically, we present a system design for integrating SICs into query planning and runtime execution and discuss its realization in AI-augmented DPSs. To guide and evaluate the vision, we outline several design goals -- covering criteria around expressiveness, runtime semantics, integration, performance, and enterprise-scale applicability -- and discuss how our framework addresses each, along with open research challenges.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models(LRMs) such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities by scaling test-time compute and generating long Chain-of-Thought(CoT). Distillation--post-training on LRMs-generated data--is a straightforward yet effective method to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models, but faces a critical bottleneck: we found that distilled long CoT data poses learning difficulty for small models and leads to the inheritance of biases (i.e. over-thinking) when using Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose constructing tree-based CoT data from scratch via Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS). We then exploit a set of CoT-aware approaches, including Thoughts Length Balance, Fine-grained DPO, and Joint Post-training Objective, to enhance SFT and RL on the constructed data. We conduct evaluation on various benchmarks such as math (GSM8K, MATH, AIME). instruction-following (Multi-IF) and planning (Blocksworld), results demonstrate our approaches substantially improve the reasoning performance of distilled models compared to standard distilled models via reducing the hallucinations in long-time thinking.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown promise across many tasks, yet their scientific reasoning capabilities remain untested, particularly in multimodal settings. We present MMSciBench, a benchmark for evaluating mathematical and physical reasoning through text-only and text-image formats, with human-annotated difficulty levels, solutions with detailed explanations, and taxonomic mappings. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant limitations, with even the best model achieving only \textbf{63.77\%} accuracy and particularly struggling with visual reasoning tasks. Our analysis exposes critical gaps in complex reasoning and visual-textual integration, establishing MMSciBench as a rigorous standard for measuring progress in multimodal scientific understanding. The code for MMSciBench is open-sourced at GitHub, and the dataset is available at Hugging Face.

Abstract: Recently, LLM agents have made rapid progress in improving their programming capabilities. However, existing benchmarks lack the ability to automatically evaluate from users' perspective, and also lack the explainability of the results of LLM agents' code generation capabilities. Thus, we introduce ProjectEval, a new benchmark for LLM agents project-level code generation's automated evaluation by simulating user interaction. ProjectEval is constructed by LLM with human reviewing. It has three different level inputs of natural languages or code skeletons. ProjectEval can evaluate the generated projects by user interaction simulation for execution, and by code similarity through existing objective indicators. Through ProjectEval, we find that systematic engineering project code, overall understanding of the project and comprehensive analysis capability are the keys for LLM agents to achieve practical projects. Our findings and benchmark provide valuable insights for developing more effective programming agents that can be deployed in future real-world production.

arXiv:2503.09532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular technique for interpreting language model activations, and there is extensive recent work on improving SAE effectiveness. However, most prior work evaluates progress using unsupervised proxy metrics with unclear practical relevance. We introduce SAEBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures SAE performance across eight diverse metrics, spanning interpretability, feature disentanglement and practical applications like unlearning. To enable systematic comparison, we open-source a suite of over 200 SAEs across eight recently proposed SAE architectures and training algorithms. Our evaluation reveals that gains on proxy metrics do not reliably translate to better practical performance. For instance, while Matryoshka SAEs slightly underperform on existing proxy metrics, they substantially outperform other architectures on feature disentanglement metrics; moreover, this advantage grows with SAE scale. By providing a standardized framework for measuring progress in SAE development, SAEBench enables researchers to study scaling trends and make nuanced comparisons between different SAE architectures and training methodologies. Our interactive interface enables researchers to flexibly visualize relationships between metrics across hundreds of open-source SAEs at: www.neuronpedia.org/sae-bench

Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation capabilities but struggle with real-world software engineering tasks, such as revising source code to address code reviews, hindering their practical use. Code review comments are often implicit, ambiguous, and colloquial, requiring models to grasp both code and human intent. This challenge calls for evaluating large language models' ability to bridge both technical and conversational contexts. While existing work has employed the automated code refinement (ACR) task to resolve these comments, current evaluation methods fall short, relying on text matching metrics that provide limited insight into model failures and remain susceptible to training data contamination. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel evaluation benchmark, $\textbf{CodeReviewQA}$ that enables us to conduct fine-grained assessment of model capabilities and mitigate data contamination risks. In CodeReviewQA, we decompose the generation task of code refinement into $\textbf{three essential reasoning steps}$: $\textit{change type recognition}$ (CTR), $\textit{change localisation}$ (CL), and $\textit{solution identification}$ (SI). Each step is reformulated as multiple-choice questions with varied difficulty levels, enabling precise assessment of model capabilities, while mitigating data contamination risks. Our comprehensive evaluation spans 72 recently released large language models on $\textbf{900 manually curated, high-quality examples}$ across nine programming languages. Our results show that CodeReviewQA is able to expose specific model weaknesses in code review comprehension, disentangled from their generative automated code refinement results.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT series, have driven significant industrial applications, leading to economic and societal transformations. However, a comprehensive understanding of their real-world applications remains limited. To address this, we introduce REALM, a dataset of over 94,000 LLM use cases collected from Reddit and news articles. REALM captures two key dimensions: the diverse applications of LLMs and the demographics of their users. It categorizes LLM applications and explores how users' occupations relate to the types of applications they use. By integrating real-world data, REALM offers insights into LLM adoption across different domains, providing a foundation for future research on their evolving societal roles.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to struggle with systematic reasoning. Even on tasks where they appear to perform well, their performance often depends on shortcuts, rather than on genuine reasoning abilities, leading them to collapse on out-of-distribution (OOD) examples. Post-training strategies based on reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought prompting have recently been hailed as a step change. However, little is known about the potential of the resulting ``Large Reasoning Models'' (LRMs) beyond maths and programming-based problem solving, where genuine OOD problems can be sparse. In this paper, we focus on tasks that require systematic relational composition for qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. The setting allows fine control over problem difficulty to precisely measure OOD generalization. We find that, zero-shot LRMs generally outperform their LLM counterparts in single-path reasoning tasks but struggle in the multi-path setting. Whilst showing comparatively better results, fine-tuned LLMs are also not capable of multi-path generalization. We also provide evidence for the behavioral interpretation for this, i.e., that LRMs are shallow disjunctive reasoners.

Abstract: We propose OmniCaptioner, a versatile visual captioning framework for generating fine-grained textual descriptions across a wide variety of visual domains. Unlike prior methods limited to specific image types (e.g., natural images or geometric visuals), our framework provides a unified solution for captioning natural images, visual text (e.g., posters, UIs, textbooks), and structured visuals (e.g., documents, tables, charts). By converting low-level pixel information into semantically rich textual representations, our framework bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities. Our results highlight three key advantages: (i) Enhanced Visual Reasoning with LLMs, where long-context captions of visual modalities empower LLMs, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 series, to reason effectively in multimodal scenarios; (ii) Improved Image Generation, where detailed captions improve tasks like text-to-image generation and image transformation; and (iii) Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which enables faster convergence with less data. We believe the versatility and adaptability of OmniCaptioner can offer a new perspective for bridging the gap between language and visual modalities.

Abstract: Predicting personality traits automatically has become a challenging problem in computer vision. This paper introduces an innovative multimodal feature learning framework for personality analysis in short video clips. For visual processing, we construct a facial graph and design a Geo-based two-stream network incorporating an attention mechanism, leveraging both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to capture static facial expressions. Additionally, ResNet18 and VGGFace networks are employed to extract global scene and facial appearance features at the frame level. To capture dynamic temporal information, we integrate a BiGRU with a temporal attention module for extracting salient frame representations. To enhance the model's robustness, we incorporate the VGGish CNN for audio-based features and XLM-Roberta for text-based features. Finally, a multimodal channel attention mechanism is introduced to integrate different modalities, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression model is used to predict personality traits. Experimental results confirm that our proposed framework surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in performance.

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are being actively explored in medicine, their ability to conduct telemedicine consultations combining accurate diagnosis with professional dialogue remains underexplored. In this paper, we present 3MDBench (Medical Multimodal Multi-agent Dialogue Benchmark), an open-source framework for simulating and evaluating LVLM-driven telemedical consultations. 3MDBench simulates patient variability through four temperament-based Patient Agents and an Assessor Agent that jointly evaluate diagnostic accuracy and dialogue quality. It includes 3013 cases across 34 diagnoses drawn from real-world telemedicine interactions, combining textual and image-based data. The experimental study compares diagnostic strategies for popular LVLMs, including GPT-4o-mini, LLaVA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, and Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct. We demonstrate that multimodal dialogue with internal reasoning improves F1 score by 6.5% over non-dialogue settings, highlighting the importance of context-aware, information-seeking questioning. Moreover, injecting predictions from a diagnostic convolutional network into the LVLM's context boosts F1 by up to 20%.

Abstract: Systematic reviews (SRs) are vital for evidence-based practice in high stakes disciplines, such as healthcare, but are often impeded by intensive labors and lengthy processes that can take months to complete. Due to the high demand for domain expertise, existing automatic summarization methods fail to accurately identify relevant studies and generate high-quality summaries. To that end, we introduce InsightAgent, a human-centered interactive AI agent powered by large language models that revolutionize this workflow. InsightAgent partitions a large literature corpus based on semantics and employs a multi-agent design for more focused processing of literature, leading to significant improvement in the quality of generated SRs. InsightAgent also provides intuitive visualizations of the corpus and agent trajectories, allowing users to effortlessly monitor the actions of the agent and provide real-time feedback based on their expertise. Our user studies with 9 medical professionals demonstrate that the visualization and interaction mechanisms can effectively improve the quality of synthesized SRs by 27.2%, reaching 79.7% of human-written quality. At the same time, user satisfaction is improved by 34.4%. With InsightAgent, it only takes a clinician about 1.5 hours, rather than months, to complete a high-quality systematic review.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) augments large language models (LLMs) with the ability to invoke external tools during long-form reasoning, such as search engines and code interpreters, to solve tasks beyond the capabilities of internal reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training such agents, most of existing approaches typically optimize only for final correctness without considering the efficiency or necessity of external tool use. This often leads to excessive tool calling, incurring high computational costs and hindering the development of internal reasoning capabilities - a phenomenon known as \textit{cognitive offloading}. To this end, we propose Optimal Tool Call-controlled Policy Optimization (OTC-PO), a simple yet effective RL-based framework that encourages models to produce accurate answers with minimal tool calls. Our method introduces a tool-integrated reward that jointly considers answer correctness and corresponding tool use behavior of model to reach that answer. To validate the effectiveness, we introduce the metric of \textit{tool productivity}, defined as the ratio between the number of correct answers and the total number of tool calls across all test cases. This metric reflects how efficiently tool usage contributes to successful task completion, with higher values indicating smarter and more autonomous reasoning. We instantiate this framework within both Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), resulting in OTC-PPO and OTC-GRPO. Experiments with Qwen-2.5 and Qwen-Math across multiple QA benchmarks show that our approach reduces tool calls by up to 68.3\% and improves tool productivity by up to 215.4\%, while maintaining comparable answer accuracy.

Abstract: In the age of social media, understanding public sentiment toward major corporations is crucial for investors, policymakers, and researchers. This paper presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis system tailored for corporate reputation monitoring, combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to accurately interpret public opinion in real time. The methodology integrates a hybrid sentiment detection framework leveraging both rule-based models (VADER) and transformer-based deep learning models (DistilBERT), applied to social media data from multiple platforms. The system begins with robust preprocessing involving noise removal and text normalization, followed by sentiment classification using an ensemble approach to ensure both interpretability and contextual accuracy. Results are visualized through sentiment distribution plots, comparative analyses, and temporal sentiment trends for enhanced interpretability. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in public sentiment across major corporations, with companies like Amazon (81.2) and Samsung (45.8) receiving excellent sentiment scores, while Microsoft (21.7) and Walmart (21.9) exhibit poor sentiment profiles. These findings demonstrate the utility of our multi-source sentiment framework in providing actionable insights regarding corporate public perception, enabling stakeholders to make informed strategic decisions based on comprehensive sentiment analysis.

<title>(Im)possibility of Automated Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Is automated hallucination detection possible? In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language $K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute hallucinations.
  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only correct examples from the target language.
  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples (explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.
  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: This paper proposes a parameter collaborative optimization algorithm for large language models, enhanced with graph spectral analysis. The goal is to improve both fine-tuning efficiency and structural awareness during training. In the proposed method, the parameters of a pre-trained language model are treated as nodes in a graph. A weighted graph is constructed, and Laplacian spectral decomposition is applied to enable frequency-domain modeling and structural representation of the parameter space. Based on this structure, a joint loss function is designed. It combines the task loss with a spectral regularization term to facilitate collaborative updates among parameters. In addition, a spectral filtering mechanism is introduced during the optimization phase. This mechanism adjusts gradients in a structure-aware manner, enhancing the model's training stability and convergence behavior. The method is evaluated on multiple tasks, including traditional fine-tuning comparisons, few-shot generalization tests, and convergence speed analysis. In all settings, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance. The experimental results confirm that the spectral collaborative optimization framework effectively reduces parameter perturbations and improves fine-tuning quality while preserving overall model performance. This work contributes significantly to the field of artificial intelligence by advancing parameter-efficient training methodologies for large-scale models, reinforcing the importance of structural signal processing in deep learning optimization, and offering a robust, generalizable framework for enhancing language model adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&amp;When dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive error steps. Using the Who&amp;When, we develop and evaluate three automated failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and the need for further research in this area.

Abstract: Systematic reviews are comprehensive literature reviews that address highly focused research questions and represent the highest form of evidence in medicine. A critical step in this process is the development of complex Boolean queries to retrieve relevant literature. Given the difficulty of manually constructing these queries, recent efforts have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in their formulation. One of the first studies,Wang et al., investigated ChatGPT for this task, followed by Staudinger et al., which evaluated multiple LLMs in a reproducibility study. However, the latter overlooked several key aspects of the original work, including (i) validation of generated queries, (ii) output formatting constraints, and (iii) selection of examples for chain-of-thought (Guided) prompting. As a result, its findings diverged significantly from the original study. In this work, we systematically reproduce both studies while addressing these overlooked factors. Our results show that query effectiveness varies significantly across models and prompt designs, with guided query formulation benefiting from well-chosen seed studies. Overall, prompt design and model selection are key drivers of successful query formulation. Our findings provide a clearer understanding of LLMs' potential in Boolean query generation and highlight the importance of model- and prompt-specific optimisations. The complex nature of systematic reviews adds to challenges in both developing and reproducing methods but also highlights the importance of reproducibility studies in this domain.

<title>EVALOOP: Assessing LLM Robustness in Programming from a Self-consistency Perspective</title>

Abstract: Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using acoustic features of segmental speech sounds to detect deepfake audio. These features are highly interpretable because of their close relationship with human articulatory processes and are expected to be more difficult for deepfake models to replicate. The results demonstrate that certain segmental features commonly used in forensic voice comparison (FVC) are effective in identifying deep-fakes, whereas some global features provide little value. These findings underscore the need to approach audio deepfake detection using methods that are distinct from those employed in traditional FVC, and offer a new perspective on leveraging segmental features for this purpose.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains, including radiology report generation. Previous approaches have attempted to utilize multimodal LLMs for this task, enhancing their performance through the integration of domain-specific knowledge retrieval. However, these approaches often overlook the knowledge already embedded within the LLMs, leading to redundant information integration. To address this limitation, we propose Radar, a framework for enhancing radiology report generation with supplementary knowledge injection. Radar improves report generation by systematically leveraging both the internal knowledge of an LLM and externally retrieved information. Specifically, it first extracts the model's acquired knowledge that aligns with expert image-based classification outputs. It then retrieves relevant supplementary knowledge to further enrich this information. Finally, by aggregating both sources, Radar generates more accurate and informative radiology reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert-Plus, and IU X-ray demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in both language quality and clinical accuracy.

arXiv:2505.14667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become powerful tools for complex problem solving, but their structured reasoning pathways can lead to unsafe outputs when exposed to harmful prompts. Existing safety alignment methods reduce harmful outputs but can degrade reasoning depth, leading to significant trade-offs in complex, multi-step tasks, and remain vulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak attacks. To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight alignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at the start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the rest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while maintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful responses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than Direct Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot variant that requires no fine-tuning. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how existing methods in LLMs generalize, or fail, when applied to reasoning-centric models, revealing critical gaps and new directions for safer AI.

arXiv:2505.17155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate exceptional capability in tackling complex mathematical, logical, and coding tasks by leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Test-time scaling methods, such as prolonging CoT with explicit token-level exploration, can push LRMs' accuracy boundaries, but they incur significant decoding overhead. A key inefficiency source is LRMs often generate redundant thinking CoTs, which demonstrate clear structured overthinking and underthinking patterns. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning processes and numerical optimization theories, we propose TrimR, a verifier-based, training-free, efficient framework for dynamic CoT compression to trim reasoning and enhance test-time scaling, explicitly tailored for production-level deployment. Our method employs a lightweight, pretrained, instruction-tuned verifier to detect and truncate redundant intermediate thoughts of LRMs without any LRM or verifier fine-tuning. We present both the core algorithm and asynchronous online system engineered for high-throughput industrial applications. Empirical evaluations on Ascend NPUs and vLLM show that our framework delivers substantial gains in inference efficiency under large-batch workloads. In particular, on the four MATH500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA benchmarks, the reasoning runtime of Pangu Pro MoE, Pangu-R-38B, QwQ-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B is improved by up to 70% with negligible impact on accuracy.

Abstract: Child literacy is a strong predictor of life outcomes at the subsequent stages of an individual's life. This points to a need for targeted interventions in vulnerable low and middle income populations to help bridge the gap between literacy levels in these regions and high income ones. In this effort, reading assessments provide an important tool to measure the effectiveness of these programs and AI can be a reliable and economical tool to support educators with this task. Developing accurate automatic reading assessment systems for child speech in low-resource languages poses significant challenges due to limited data and the unique acoustic properties of children's voices. This study focuses on Xhosa, a language spoken in South Africa, to advance child speech recognition capabilities. We present a novel dataset composed of child speech samples in Xhosa. The dataset is available upon request and contains ten words and letters, which are part of the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) system. Each recording is labeled with an online and cost-effective approach by multiple markers and a subsample is validated by an independent EGRA reviewer. This dataset is evaluated with three fine-tuned state-of-the-art end-to-end models: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and Whisper. The results indicate that the performance of these models can be significantly influenced by the amount and balancing of the available training data, which is fundamental for cost-effective large dataset collection. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that the wav2vec 2.0 performance is improved by training on multiple classes at a time, even when the number of available samples is constrained.

Abstract: This paper presents a pioneering exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) via group relative policy optimization for unified multimodal large language models (ULMs), aimed at simultaneously reinforcing generation and understanding capabilities. Through systematic pilot studies, we uncover the significant potential of ULMs to enable the synergistic co-evolution of dual capabilities within a shared policy optimization framework. Building on this insight, we introduce CoRL, a co-reinforcement learning framework comprising a unified RL stage for joint optimization and a refined RL stage for task-specific enhancement. With the proposed CoRL, our resulting model, ULM-R1, achieves average improvements of 7% on three text-to-image generation datasets and 23% on nine multimodal understanding benchmarks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRL and highlight the substantial benefit of reinforcement learning in facilitating cross-task synergy and optimization for ULMs. Code is available at https://github.com/mm-vl/ULM-R1.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the use of RL beyond reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored, especially for perceptionintensive tasks like object detection and grounding. We propose V-Triune, a Visual Triple Unified Reinforcement Learning system that enables VLMs to jointly learn visual reasoning and perception tasks within a single training pipeline. V-Triune comprises triple complementary components: Sample-Level Data Formatting (to unify diverse task inputs), Verifier-Level Reward Computation (to deliver custom rewards via specialized verifiers) , and Source-Level Metric Monitoring (to diagnose problems at the data-source level). We further introduce a novel Dynamic IoU reward, which provides adaptive, progressive, and definite feedback for perception tasks handled by V-Triune. Our approach is instantiated within off-the-shelf RL training framework using open-source 7B and 32B backbone models. The resulting model, dubbed Orsta (One RL to See Them All), demonstrates consistent improvements across both reasoning and perception tasks. This broad capability is significantly shaped by its training on a diverse dataset, constructed around four representative visual reasoning tasks (Math, Puzzle, Chart, and Science) and four visual perception tasks (Grounding, Detection, Counting, and OCR). Subsequently, Orsta achieves substantial gains on MEGA-Bench Core, with improvements ranging from +2.1 to an impressive +14.1 across its various 7B and 32B model variants, with performance benefits extending to a wide range of downstream tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our unified RL approach for VLMs. The V-Triune system, along with the Orsta models, is publicly available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI.

Abstract: The integration of large language model (LLM) and data management (DATA) is rapidly redefining both domains. In this survey, we comprehensively review the bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, DATA4LLM, spanning large-scale data processing, storage, and serving, feeds LLMs with high quality, diversity, and timeliness of data required for stages like pre-training, post-training, retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic workflows: (i) Data processing for LLMs includes scalable acquisition, deduplication, filtering, selection, domain mixing, and synthetic augmentation; (ii) Data Storage for LLMs focuses on efficient data and model formats, distributed and heterogeneous storage hierarchies, KV-cache management, and fault-tolerant checkpointing; (iii) Data serving for LLMs tackles challenges in RAG (e.g., knowledge post-processing), LLM inference (e.g., prompt compression, data provenance), and training strategies (e.g., data packing and shuffling). On the other hand, in LLM4DATA, LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning, integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g., configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning, and multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information. However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 330 chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning, 2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and videos has motivated extending these models to understand 3D scenes, aiming for human-like visual-spatial intelligence. Nevertheless, achieving deep spatial understanding comparable to human capabilities poses significant challenges in model encoding and data acquisition. Existing methods frequently depend on external depth sensors for geometry capture or utilize off-the-shelf algorithms for pre-constructing 3D maps, thereby limiting their scalability, especially with prevalent monocular video inputs and for time-sensitive applications. In this work, we introduce VLM-3R, a unified framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that incorporates 3D Reconstructive instruction tuning. VLM-3R processes monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D tokens that represent spatial understanding. Leveraging our Spatial-Visual-View Fusion and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning question-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial context with language instructions. This enables monocular 3D spatial assistance and embodied reasoning. To facilitate the evaluation of temporal reasoning, we introduce the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence benchmark, featuring over 138.6K QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving spatial relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, VLM-3R, not only facilitates robust visual-spatial reasoning but also enables the understanding of temporal 3D context changes, excelling in both accuracy and scalability.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) faces challenges in weak KB awareness, efficiency, and reliance on annotated data. To tackle these issues, KBQA-o1 is proposed as an agentic KBQA method utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). KBQA-o1 employs a ReAct-based agent process for logical form generation and MCTS for exploration within the KB environment. This method balances exploration performance and search space using heuristic search driven by policy and reward models. KBQA-o1 generates high-quality annotations for fine-tuning, surpassing previous low-resource KBQA methods with limited annotated data. Experiments demonstrate that KBQA-o1 significantly improves the GrailQA F1 performance of the Llama-3.1-8B model, achieving a notable increase compared to the previous state-of-the-art method utilizing GPT-3.5-turbo. The code for KBQA-o1 is openly accessible for further research and applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions with a large-scale structured knowledge base (KB). Despite advancements with large language models (LLMs), KBQA still faces challenges in weak KB awareness, imbalance between effectiveness and efficiency, and high reliance on annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose KBQA-o1, a novel agentic KBQA method with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It introduces a ReAct-based agent process for stepwise logical form generation with KB environment exploration. Moreover, it employs MCTS, a heuristic search method driven by policy and reward models, to balance agentic exploration's performance and search space. With heuristic exploration, KBQA-o1 generates high-quality annotations for further improvement by incremental fine-tuning. Experimental results show that KBQA-o1 outperforms previous low-resource KBQA methods with limited annotated data, boosting Llama-3.1-8B model's GrailQA F1 performance to 78.5% compared to 48.5% of the previous sota method with GPT-3.5-turbo. Our code is publicly available.

Summary:
Automatic speech recognition for dysarthric speech faces challenges due to data scarcity, especially in non-English languages. This study addresses the issue by fine-tuning a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech to capture speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions. The model is then used to convert healthy non-English speech into dysarthric-like speech. The generated data is employed to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model, resulting in improved dysarthric speech recognition performance. Evaluation on various languages including Spanish, Italian, and Tamil shows that voice conversion with both speaker and prosody conversion outperforms conventional augmentation techniques. The objective and subjective analyses of the generated data confirm that the simulated dysarthric speech characteristics are accurately captured. <div>

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for dysarthric speech remains challenging due to data scarcity, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we fine-tune a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech (UASpeech) to encode both speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions, then apply it to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model, Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE (Tamil) demonstrates that VC with both speaker and prosody conversion significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and subjective analyses of the generated data further confirm that the generated speech simulates dysarthric characteristics.

<div> Keywords: Factual hallucinations, Large Language Models, Truthfulness encoding, Dataset generation, Evaluation

Summary:
In this study, the focus is on the challenge of factual hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their impact on reliability and trust. Previous research indicated that LLMs encode information about truthfulness when generating false statements. The study challenges this notion by creating a more realistic dataset for evaluating factuality in LLM-generated text. The authors introduce a method for sampling true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and generating LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering collections. While the findings of previous studies are partially confirmed, generalization to LLM-generated datasets remains complex. This research sets the foundation for future studies on factuality in LLMs and provides guidelines for more effective evaluation.

Abstract: Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness. However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism, which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to LLM-generated datasets remains challenging. This study lays the groundwork for future research on factuality in LLMs and offers practical guidelines for more effective evaluation.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces the Attention Localization and Pruning Strategy (ALPS) to enhance the alignment efficiency of large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks. ALPS focuses on localizing task-sensitive attention heads and pruning non-essential parameters during training, reducing alignment costs significantly. Experimental results show that ALPS activates only 10% of attention parameters during fine-tuning while improving performance by 2% compared to baselines across three tasks. The identified task-specific attention heads are transferrable across datasets, helping mitigate knowledge forgetting issues. Overall, ALPS provides a novel and efficient approach to LLM alignment, offering insights into improving performance without sacrificing generalization or reusability of the model. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Aligning general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks often incurs significant training adjustment costs. Prior research has explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model alignment efficiency, we propose the \textit{\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{L}ocalization and \textbf{P}runing \textbf{S}trategy (\textbf{ALPS})}, an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method activates only \textbf{10\%} of attention parameters during fine-tuning while achieving a \textbf{2\%} performance improvement over baselines on three tasks. Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets and mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel perspective on efficient LLM alignment.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) research has grown rapidly, along with increasing concern about their limitations such as failures in reasoning, hallucinations, and limited multilingual capability. While prior reviews have addressed these issues, they often focus on individual limitations or consider them within the broader context of evaluating overall model performance. This survey addresses the gap by presenting a data-driven, semi-automated review of research on limitations of LLMs (LLLMs) from 2022 to 2025, using a bottom-up approach. From a corpus of 250,000 ACL and arXiv papers, we extract 14,648 relevant limitation papers using keyword filtering and LLM-based classification, validated against expert labels. Using topic clustering (via two approaches, HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM), we identify between 7 and 15 prominent types of limitations discussed in recent LLM research across the ACL and arXiv datasets. We find that LLM-related research increases nearly sixfold in ACL and nearly fifteenfold in arXiv between 2022 and 2025, while LLLMs research grows even faster, by a factor of over 12 in ACL and nearly 28 in arXiv. Reasoning remains the most studied limitation, followed by generalization, hallucination, bias, and security. The distribution of topics in the ACL dataset stays relatively stable over time, while arXiv shifts toward safety and controllability (with topics like security risks, alignment, hallucinations, knowledge editing), and multimodality between 2022 and 2025. We offer a quantitative view of trends in LLM limitations research and release a dataset of annotated abstracts and a validated methodology, available at: https://github.com/a-kostikova/LLLMs-Survey.

Summary: 
This research explores training Large Language Models (LLMs) for mathematical problem-solving using format and length as surrogate signals instead of traditional ground truth answers. By focusing on format correctness and incorporating length-based rewards, the proposed approach, known as GRPO, outperforms standard methods in certain scenarios. The study shows that the base model already possesses strong mathematical and logical reasoning skills but needs to develop good answering habits to excel in exams. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of the model, the GRPO approach achieves high accuracy on the AIME2024 exam without extensive reliance on ground truth data. This novel approach not only offers a practical solution for training LLMs but also sheds light on the potential of label-free learning in mathematical problem-solving tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, with Reinforcement Learning playing a key role in adapting them to specific applications. However, obtaining ground truth answers for training LLMs in mathematical problem-solving is often challenging, costly, and sometimes unfeasible. This research delves into the utilization of format and length as surrogate signals to train LLMs for mathematical problem-solving, bypassing the need for traditional ground truth answers.Our study shows that a reward function centered on format correctness alone can yield performance improvements comparable to the standard GRPO algorithm in early phases. Recognizing the limitations of format-only rewards in the later phases, we incorporate length-based rewards. The resulting GRPO approach, leveraging format-length surrogate signals, not only matches but surpasses the performance of the standard GRPO algorithm relying on ground truth answers in certain scenarios, achieving 40.0% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model. Through systematic exploration and experimentation, this research not only offers a practical solution for training LLMs to solve mathematical problems and reducing the dependence on extensive ground truth data collection, but also reveals the essence of why our label-free approach succeeds: the powerful base model is like an excellent student who has already mastered mathematical and logical reasoning skills, but performs poorly on the test paper, it simply needs to develop good answering habits to achieve outstanding results in exams , to unlock the capabilities it already possesses.

Abstract: Customizable multilingual zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) has various potential applications in music composition and short video dubbing. However, existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations, limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration, extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3) Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision, enhancing both the synthesis quality and style modeling of the generated singing voice. Experimental results show that TCSinger 2 outperforms baseline models in both subjective and objective metrics across multiple related tasks.

<div> Keywords: large language models, cultural context, human meaning, thick description, generative AI

Summary:
This paper discusses how large language models (LLMs) can enhance the representation of human meaning in AI systems by incorporating cultural context through thick description. Unlike thin descriptions that strip away context, thick descriptions from humanities and social sciences capture the richness of human activity. LLMs offer a way to automate the generation and processing of thick descriptions, addressing the challenge of scalability. By focusing on thick descriptions, new representational formats can be developed to make human meaning legible in AI systems. The paper identifies five key challenges in this approach: preserving context, embracing interpretive pluralism, integrating diverse perspectives, distinguishing qualitative content, and recognizing the dynamic nature of meaning. Thick description could serve as a unifying framework to address concerns about representing culture in LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to incorporate cultural context and human meaning in AI systems through thick description, addressing scalability challenges. It advocates for the development of new representational formats focusing on thick descriptions to make human meaning legible in AI.

It suggests that thick description could offer a unifying framework to address concerns about representing culture in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2505.23785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs) can make cultural context, and therefore human meaning, legible at an unprecedented scale in AI-based sociotechnical systems. We argue that such systems have previously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin descriptions: numerical representations that enforce standardization and therefore strip human activity of the cultural context that gives it meaning. By contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have developed frameworks for representing meaning through thick description: verbal representations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual information needed to represent human meaning. While these methods can effectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the verbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially) automating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially overcoming this bottleneck. We argue that the problem of rendering human meaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics, but about developing new representational formats (based on thick description). We frame this as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify five key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism, integrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance, distinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and acknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static. Furthermore, we suggest that thick description has the potential to serve as a unifying framework to address a number of emerging concerns about the difficulties of representing culture in (or using) LLMs.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, copyright infringement, fair use doctrine, FUA-LLM, Direct Preference Optimization

Summary:
The article discusses the risks of copyright infringement that large language models (LLMs) face due to reproducing protected content. It introduces FUA-LLM, a framework aligned with fair use doctrine to address these concerns. FairUseDB, a dataset containing expert-validated examples, is utilized to train LLMs to generate legally compliant outputs. The study employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune LLMs and reduce problematic outputs. New evaluation metrics, Weighted Penalty Utility and Compliance Aware Harmonic Mean (CAH), are proposed to assess infringement risk and response utility. Experimental results show that FUA-LLM successfully reduces problematic outputs while maintaining usability. The framework aims to balance legal compliance with practical application in LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly risk copyright infringement by reproducing protected content verbatim or with insufficient transformative modifications, posing significant ethical, legal, and practical concerns. Current inference-time safeguards predominantly rely on restrictive refusal-based filters, often compromising the practical utility of these models. To address this, we collaborated closely with intellectual property experts to develop FUA-LLM (Fair Use Aligned Language Models), a legally-grounded framework explicitly designed to align LLM outputs with fair-use doctrine. Central to our method is FairUseDB, a carefully constructed dataset containing 18,000 expert-validated examples covering nine realistic infringement scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, encouraging them to produce legally compliant and practically useful alternatives rather than resorting to blunt refusal. Recognizing the shortcomings of traditional evaluation metrics, we propose new measures: Weighted Penalty Utility and Compliance Aware Harmonic Mean (CAH) to balance infringement risk against response utility. Extensive quantitative experiments coupled with expert evaluations confirm that FUA-LLM substantially reduces problematic outputs (up to 20\%) compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while preserving real-world usability.

Summary: LitChat is introduced as a solution to the challenges posed by the exponential growth of digital scientific publications, known as "big literature". Traditional manual reviewing is no longer feasible due to the volume of publications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in literature comprehension, they lack the ability to provide comprehensive, objective, open, and transparent views required for systematic reviews.

Abstract: We are living in an era of "big literature", where the volume of digital scientific publications is growing exponentially. While offering new opportunities, this also poses challenges for understanding literature landscapes, as traditional manual reviewing is no longer feasible. Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities for literature comprehension, yet they are incapable of offering "comprehensive, objective, open and transparent" views desired by systematic reviews due to their limited context windows and trust issues like hallucinations. Here we present LitChat, an end-to-end, interactive and conversational literature agent that augments LLM agents with data-driven discovery tools to facilitate literature exploration. LitChat automatically interprets user queries, retrieves relevant sources, constructs knowledge graphs, and employs diverse data-mining techniques to generate evidence-based insights addressing user needs. We illustrate the effectiveness of LitChat via a case study on AI4Health, highlighting its capacity to quickly navigate the users through large-scale literature landscape with data-based evidence that is otherwise infeasible with traditional means.

<div> Keywords: large language models, mutual information, token-level MI, recoverability task, encoder-only models

Summary: 
- The article introduces an information-theoretic framework based on mutual information to evaluate intrinsic linguistic understanding of large language models (LLMs).
- Understanding is quantified as mutual information between input sentences and their latent representations, with a focus on token-level mutual information.
- Token-level mutual information measures how effectively input information is preserved in sentence embeddings and can be computed using Fano's inequality.
- The study reveals that encoder-only LLMs consistently maintain higher token-level mutual information compared to decoder-only models.
- Fine-tuning LLMs to maximize token-level recoverability improves their understanding abilities on tasks without task-specific supervision. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet evaluating their intrinsic linguistic understanding remains challenging. Moving beyond specialized evaluation tasks, we propose an information-theoretic framework grounded in mutual information (MI) to achieve this. We formalize the understanding as MI between an input sentence and its latent representation (sentence-level MI), measuring how effectively input information is preserved in latent representation. Given that LLMs learn embeddings for individual tokens, we decompose sentence-level MI into token-level MI between tokens and sentence embeddings, establishing theoretical bounds connecting these measures. Based on this foundation, we theoretically derive a computable lower bound for token-level MI using Fano's inequality, which directly relates to token-level recoverability-the ability to predict original tokens from sentence embedding. We implement this recoverability task to comparatively measure MI across different LLMs, revealing that encoder-only models consistently maintain higher information fidelity than their decoder-only counterparts, with the latter exhibiting a distinctive late-layer "forgetting" pattern where mutual information is first enhanced and then discarded. Moreover, fine-tuning to maximize token-level recoverability consistently improves understanding ability of LLMs on tasks without task-specific supervision, demonstrating that mutual information can serve as a foundation for understanding and improving language model capabilities.

<div> retrieval-augmented generation, Reinforcement learning, reasoning, retrieval, external knowledge

Summary: 
Reinforcement learning is used in the R3-RAG model to enhance the retrieval and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling step-by-step reasoning and retrieval of external knowledge. The model consists of two stages: cold start to learn the iterative process of reasoning and retrieval, and reinforcement learning to improve exploration of the retrieval environment. Two rewards, answer correctness and relevance-based document verification, guide the model towards generating correct answers by iteratively reasoning and retrieving relevant documents. Experimental results demonstrate that R3-RAG outperforms baseline models and exhibits transferability across different retrievers. The implementation of R3-RAG can be accessed on GitHub for further exploration and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance factual correctness and mitigate hallucination. However, dense retrievers often become the bottleneck of RAG systems due to their limited parameters compared to LLMs and their inability to perform step-by-step reasoning. While prompt-based iterative RAG attempts to address these limitations, it is constrained by human-designed workflows. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{R3-RAG}$, which uses $\textbf{R}$einforcement learning to make the LLM learn how to $\textbf{R}$eason and $\textbf{R}$etrieve step by step, thus retrieving comprehensive external knowledge and leading to correct answers. R3-RAG is divided into two stages. We first use cold start to make the model learn the manner of iteratively interleaving reasoning and retrieval. Then we use reinforcement learning to further harness its ability to better explore the external retrieval environment. Specifically, we propose two rewards for R3-RAG: 1) answer correctness for outcome reward, which judges whether the trajectory leads to a correct answer; 2) relevance-based document verification for process reward, encouraging the model to retrieve documents that are relevant to the user question, through which we can let the model learn how to iteratively reason and retrieve relevant documents to get the correct answer. Experimental results show that R3-RAG significantly outperforms baselines and can transfer well to different retrievers. We release R3-RAG at https://github.com/Yuan-Li-FNLP/R3-RAG.

<div> Keywords: large language models, naming game, social norms, data leakage, coordination game

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have been studied in the context of a naming game to understand if they spontaneously develop linguistic conventions resembling human social norms. However, a recent study by Ashery et al. suggests that the observed behaviors may be attributed to data leakage, where the models reproduce known conventions from their pre-training data. Despite mitigation measures taken by the authors, further analysis reveals that LLMs recognize and recall the structure and outcomes of the coordination game rather than exhibiting emergent conventions. This indicates that the models may be simply memorizing the training corpus, raising questions about the genuine emergence of social norms in LLMs. The findings suggest the need for alternative strategies and provoke reflection on the use of LLMs in social science modeling.

<br /><br />Summary: Large language models paired in a naming game may not truly develop linguistic conventions but instead mimic known patterns from pre-training data, suggesting data leakage. The models seem to recognize and recall the coordination game's structure and outcomes, implying memorization of training data rather than emergence of conventions. The study calls for consideration of alternative approaches and prompts a reevaluation of the role of LLMs in social science research. <div>
arXiv:2505.23796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ashery et al. recently argue that large language models (LLMs), when paired to play a classic "naming game," spontaneously develop linguistic conventions reminiscent of human social norms. Here, we show that their results are better explained by data leakage: the models simply reproduce conventions they already encountered during pre-training. Despite the authors' mitigation measures, we provide multiple analyses demonstrating that the LLMs recognize the structure of the coordination game and recall its outcomes, rather than exhibit "emergent" conventions. Consequently, the observed behaviors are indistinguishable from memorization of the training corpus. We conclude by pointing to potential alternative strategies and reflecting more generally on the place of LLMs for social science models.

Abstract: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are increasingly recognized as a critical societal concern, highlighting the urgent need for effective tools to enable early detection of suicidal risk. In this work, we develop robust machine learning models that leverage Reddit posts to automatically classify them into four distinct levels of suicide risk severity. We frame this as a multi-class classification task and propose a RoBERTa-TF-IDF-PCA Hybrid model, integrating the deep contextual embeddings from Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa), a state-of-the-art deep learning transformer model, with the statistical term-weighting of TF-IDF, further compressed with PCA, to boost the accuracy and reliability of suicide risk assessment. To address data imbalance and overfitting, we explore various data resampling techniques and data augmentation strategies to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we compare our model's performance against that of using RoBERTa only, the BERT model and other traditional machine learning classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model can achieve improved performance, giving a best weighted $F_{1}$ score of 0.7512.

Summary:
- The study examines social bias in vision-language models (VLMs) and its impact on generative responses.
- Four state-of-the-art VLMs are evaluated on datasets for bias in responses related to gender and race.
- Models display bias in responses and confidence levels towards certain social groups.
- Hidden layers in VLMs show fluctuations in fairness levels, with some contributing to bias.
- A post-hoc method is proposed to mitigate social bias during the inference stage, by ablating bias-associated residuals and amplifying fairness-associated ones in model hidden layers, leading to fairer responses and more reliable confidence levels.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social bias is a critical issue in large vision-language models (VLMs), where fairness- and ethics-related problems harm certain groups of people in society. It is unknown to what extent VLMs yield social bias in generative responses. In this study, we focus on evaluating and mitigating social bias on both the model's response and probability distribution. To do so, we first evaluate four state-of-the-art VLMs on PAIRS and SocialCounterfactuals datasets with the multiple-choice selection task. Surprisingly, we find that models suffer from generating gender-biased or race-biased responses. We also observe that models are prone to stating their responses are fair, but indeed having mis-calibrated confidence levels towards particular social groups. While investigating why VLMs are unfair in this study, we observe that VLMs' hidden layers exhibit substantial fluctuations in fairness levels. Meanwhile, residuals in each layer show mixed effects on fairness, with some contributing positively while some lead to increased bias. Based on these findings, we propose a post-hoc method for the inference stage to mitigate social bias, which is training-free and model-agnostic. We achieve this by ablating bias-associated residuals while amplifying fairness-associated residuals on model hidden layers during inference. We demonstrate that our post-hoc method outperforms the competing training strategies, helping VLMs have fairer responses and more reliable confidence levels.

<div> consistency, large language models, hallucinations, fragility, user study  
Summary:  
Large language models (LLMs) often generate inconsistent or unreliable text due to hallucinations and sensitivity to prompt perturbations. Various methods have been proposed to address these issues, including measuring the consistency of LLM responses. Existing approaches to estimating consistency do not align well with human perceptions, as shown by a user study involving 2,976 participants. A new logit-based ensemble method is introduced to estimate LLM consistency, demonstrating comparable performance to current metrics in predicting human ratings. The study suggests that current methods may not accurately capture human perceptions of LLM responses, highlighting the need for more widespread evaluation with human input. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations and sensitive to prompt perturbations, often resulting in inconsistent or unreliable generated text. Different methods have been proposed to mitigate such hallucinations and fragility -- one of them being measuring the consistency (the model's confidence in the response, or likelihood of generating a similar response when resampled) of LLM responses. In previous work, measuring consistency often relied on the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampled responses, or internal states or logits of responses. However, it is not yet clear how well these approaches approximate how humans perceive the consistency of LLM responses. We performed a user study (n=2,976) and found current methods typically do not approximate users' perceptions of LLM consistency very well. We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimating LLM consistency, and we show that this method matches the performance of the best-performing existing metric in estimating human ratings of LLM consistency. Our results suggest that methods of estimating LLM consistency without human evaluation are sufficiently imperfect that we suggest evaluation with human input be more broadly used.

Abstract: Background: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for training machine learning models while preserving data privacy. However, applying FL to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks presents unique challenges due to semantic heterogeneity across clients, vocabulary mismatches, and varying resource constraints on edge devices. Objectives: This paper introduces SEMFED, a novel semantic-aware resource-efficient federated learning framework specifically designed for heterogeneous NLP tasks. Methods: SEMFED incorporates three key innovations: (1) a semantic-aware client selection mechanism that balances semantic diversity with resource constraints, (2) adaptive NLP-specific model architectures tailored to device capabilities while preserving semantic information, and (3) a communication-efficient semantic feature compression technique that significantly reduces bandwidth requirements. Results: Experimental results on various NLP classification tasks demonstrate that SEMFED achieves an 80.5% reduction in communication costs while maintaining model accuracy above 98%, outperforming state-of-the-art FL approaches. Conclusion: SEMFED effectively manages heterogeneous client environments with varying computational resources, network reliability, and semantic data distributions, making it particularly suitable for real-world federated NLP deployments.

arXiv:2505.23802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve near-perfect scores on medical licensing exams, these evaluations inadequately reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world clinical practice. We introduce MedHELM, an extensible evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance for medical tasks with three key contributions. First, a clinician-validated taxonomy spanning 5 categories, 22 subcategories, and 121 tasks developed with 29 clinicians. Second, a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising 35 benchmarks (17 existing, 18 newly formulated) providing complete coverage of all categories and subcategories in the taxonomy. Third, a systematic comparison of LLMs with improved evaluation methods (using an LLM-jury) and a cost-performance analysis. Evaluation of 9 frontier LLMs, using the 35 benchmarks, revealed significant performance variation. Advanced reasoning models (DeepSeek R1: 66% win-rate; o3-mini: 64% win-rate) demonstrated superior performance, though Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable results at 40% lower estimated computational cost. On a normalized accuracy scale (0-1), most models performed strongly in Clinical Note Generation (0.73-0.85) and Patient Communication & Education (0.78-0.83), moderately in Medical Research Assistance (0.65-0.75), and generally lower in Clinical Decision Support (0.56-0.72) and Administration & Workflow (0.53-0.63). Our LLM-jury evaluation method achieved good agreement with clinician ratings (ICC = 0.47), surpassing both average clinician-clinician agreement (ICC = 0.43) and automated baselines including ROUGE-L (0.36) and BERTScore-F1 (0.44). Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable performance to top models at lower estimated cost. These findings highlight the importance of real-world, task-specific evaluation for medical use of LLMs and provides an open source framework to enable this.

<div> calibrated confidence score, text-to-SQL parsing, large language models, Platt scaling, sub-clause frequency

Summary:
The paper introduces a benchmark for post-hoc calibration of text-to-SQL parsing using large language models (LLMs). It addresses the need for trustworthy systems by focusing on providing calibrated confidence scores that convey the likelihood of query correctness. By implementing Platt scaling, a calibration method, significant improvements in accuracy are achieved compared to using raw model output probabilities. Additionally, a novel approach called sub-clause frequency (SCF) scores leverages the structured nature of SQL queries to offer more detailed correctness signals. Through multivariate Platt scaling (MPS), which extends the traditional technique, individual SCF scores are combined to produce an accurate and calibrated overall score. Empirical evaluations on popular text-to-SQL datasets demonstrate that the combination of MPS and SCF leads to enhanced calibration and improved error detection capabilities over conventional Platt scaling methods. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on text-to-SQL parsing, they sometimes exhibit unexpected failures in which they are confidently incorrect. Building trustworthy text-to-SQL systems thus requires eliciting reliable uncertainty measures from the LLM. In this paper, we study the problem of providing a calibrated confidence score that conveys the likelihood of an output query being correct. Our work is the first to establish a benchmark for post-hoc calibration of LLM-based text-to-SQL parsing. In particular, we show that Platt scaling, a canonical method for calibration, provides substantial improvements over directly using raw model output probabilities as confidence scores. Furthermore, we propose a method for text-to-SQL calibration that leverages the structured nature of SQL queries to provide more granular signals of correctness, named "sub-clause frequency" (SCF) scores. Using multivariate Platt scaling (MPS), our extension of the canonical Platt scaling technique, we combine individual SCF scores into an overall accurate and calibrated score. Empirical evaluation on two popular text-to-SQL datasets shows that our approach of combining MPS and SCF yields further improvements in calibration and the related task of error detection over traditional Platt scaling.

In the article, the authors introduce a hybrid framework called MedOrchestra that combines the strengths of cloud and local large language models (LLMs) for clinical tasks. The cloud LLM decomposes complex clinical tasks into subtasks and generates prompts, while the local LLM executes these subtasks in a privacy-preserving manner. By leveraging clinical guidelines and synthetic test cases, the cloud LLM generates and validates prompts without accessing sensitive clinical data. Evaluation on pancreatic cancer staging using radiology reports showed that MedOrchestra achieved 70.21% accuracy on free-text reports, outperforming both local model baselines and board-certified clinicians. Additionally, MedOrchestra reached 85.42% accuracy on structured reports, demonstrating superior performance in all settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in clinical settings faces critical trade-offs: cloud LLMs, with their extensive parameters and superior performance, pose risks to sensitive clinical data privacy, while local LLMs preserve privacy but often fail at complex clinical interpretation tasks. We propose MedOrchestra, a hybrid framework where a cloud LLM decomposes complex clinical tasks into manageable subtasks and prompt generation, while a local LLM executes these subtasks in a privacy-preserving manner. Without accessing clinical data, the cloud LLM generates and validates subtask prompts using clinical guidelines and synthetic test cases. The local LLM executes subtasks locally and synthesizes outputs generated by the cloud LLM. We evaluate MedOrchestra on pancreatic cancer staging using 100 radiology reports under NCCN guidelines. On free-text reports, MedOrchestra achieves 70.21% accuracy, outperforming local model baselines (without guideline: 48.94%, with guideline: 56.59%) and board-certified clinicians (gastroenterologists: 59.57%, surgeons: 65.96%, radiologists: 55.32%). On structured reports, MedOrchestra reaches 85.42% accuracy, showing clear superiority across all settings.

Summary:
Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP) is introduced as a novel method to optimize the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by adaptively determining the relative importance of each layer based on model weights and input activation information. This approach addresses the limitations of existing non-uniform layerwise pruning techniques by assigning pruning rates dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that DLP effectively maintains model performance at high sparsity levels across multiple LLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. For example, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the perplexity of LLaMA2-7B by 7.79 and enhances average accuracy by 2.7%. Additionally, DLP is compatible with various LLM compression techniques and can be seamlessly integrated into Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). The code for DLP is publicly available on GitHub to support future research endeavors. 

Summary: <br /><br />Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP) optimizes Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically assigning pruning rates based on layer importance, leading to improved performance at high sparsity levels. Compatible with various LLM compression techniques, DLP outperforms existing methods, as demonstrated through experimental results, including significantly reduced perplexity and enhanced accuracy. The code for DLP is accessible on GitHub, offering potential advancements in LLM research. <div>
arXiv:2505.23807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pruning has recently been widely adopted to reduce the parameter scale and improve the inference efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Mainstream pruning techniques often rely on uniform layerwise pruning strategies, which can lead to severe performance degradation at high sparsity levels. Recognizing the varying contributions of different layers in LLMs, recent studies have shifted their focus toward non-uniform layerwise pruning. However, these approaches often rely on pre-defined values, which can result in suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP). This approach adaptively determines the relative importance of each layer by integrating model weights with input activation information, assigning pruning rates accordingly. Experimental results show that DLP effectively preserves model performance at high sparsity levels across multiple LLMs. Specifically, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the perplexity of LLaMA2-7B by 7.79 and improves the average accuracy by 2.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DLP is compatible with various existing LLM compression techniques and can be seamlessly integrated into Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). We release the code at https://github.com/ironartisan/DLP to facilitate future research.

<div> Keywords: Low-rank adaptation, DenseLoRA, large language models, parameter efficiency, representation fine-tuning

Summary:
DenseLoRA is introduced as a more efficient approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) compared to Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). It incorporates a single Encoder-Decoder to refine and compress hidden representations across all adaptation layers before applying adaptation, resulting in improved parameter efficiency. Instead of using redundant low-rank matrices, DenseLoRA adapts LLMs through a dense low-rank matrix. Experimental results show that DenseLoRA achieves 83.8% accuracy with only 0.01% of trainable parameters on benchmark datasets, outperforming LoRA's accuracy of 80.8% with 0.70% of trainable parameters on LLaMA3-8B. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of DenseLoRA's components on overall model performance. The code for DenseLoRA is available on GitHub at https://github.com/mulin-ahu/DenseLoRA.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been developed as an efficient approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning two low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, prior research indicates that many of the weights in these matrices are redundant, leading to inefficiencies in parameter utilization. To address this limitation, we introduce Dense Low-Rank Adaptation (DenseLoRA), a novel approach that enhances parameter efficiency while achieving superior performance compared to LoRA. DenseLoRA builds upon the concept of representation fine-tuning, incorporating a single Encoder-Decoder to refine and compress hidden representations across all adaptation layers before applying adaptation. Instead of relying on two redundant low-rank matrices as in LoRA, DenseLoRA adapts LLMs through a dense low-rank matrix, improving parameter utilization and adaptation efficiency. We evaluate DenseLoRA on various benchmarks, showing that it achieves 83.8% accuracy with only 0.01% of trainable parameters, compared to LoRA's 80.8% accuracy with 0.70% of trainable parameters on LLaMA3-8B. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to systematically assess the impact of DenseLoRA's components on overall model performance. Code is available at https://github.com/mulin-ahu/DenseLoRA.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Dialogue, Benchmark, Robustness, Attention Visualization.

Summary:
MARS-Bench is a new benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling long, complex dialogue sessions. The benchmark focuses on three critical aspects of multi-turn conversations: Ultra Multi-turn, Interactive Multi-turn, and Cross-turn Tasks. Experiments on MARS-Bench show that closed-source LLMs outperform open-source alternatives and that explicit reasoning improves LLMs' performance in handling complex dialogues. The benchmark also highlights the challenges LLMs face with motivation transfer and cross-turn dependency. Additionally, attention visualization experiments in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruction provide mechanistic interpretability on how attention sinks due to special tokens lead to LLMs' performance degradation in long dialogue sessions. Overall, MARS-Bench sheds light on the weaknesses of LLMs in real-world dialogue applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (\textbf{LLMs}), e.g. ChatGPT, have been widely adopted in real-world dialogue applications. However, LLMs' robustness, especially in handling long complex dialogue sessions, including frequent motivation transfer, sophisticated cross-turn dependency, is criticized all along. Nevertheless, no existing benchmarks can fully reflect these weaknesses. We present \textbf{MARS-Bench}, a \textbf{M}ulti-turn \textbf{A}thletic \textbf{R}eal-world \textbf{S}cenario Dialogue \textbf{Bench}mark, designed to remedy the gap. MARS-Bench is constructed from play-by-play text commentary so to feature realistic dialogues specifically designed to evaluate three critical aspects of multi-turn conversations: Ultra Multi-turn, Interactive Multi-turn, and Cross-turn Tasks. Extensive experiments on MARS-Bench also reveal that closed-source LLMs significantly outperform open-source alternatives, explicit reasoning significantly boosts LLMs' robustness on handling long complex dialogue sessions, and LLMs indeed face significant challenges when handling motivation transfer and sophisticated cross-turn dependency. Moreover, we provide mechanistic interpretability on how attention sinks due to special tokens lead to LLMs' performance degradation when handling long complex dialogue sessions based on attention visualization experiment in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruction.

Keywords: framework, LayerIF, data-driven, Large Language Models, training quality <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called LayerIF, which leverages Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in Large Language Models (LLMs) in a task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples, data-driven estimates of layer importance are derived. The method provides task-specific layer importance estimates, revealing how different layers specialize for various test-time evaluation tasks. The utility of these scores is demonstrated in expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning, leading to consistent gains in task performance across multiple LLM architectures. The framework addresses the variability in training quality of different layers in LLMs and provides a model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation approach for improved downstream performance. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers' training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting their downstream performance.It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task performance.

<div> dual cross-attention, emotion-aware, stance prediction, label fusion, misinformative social media content
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel method called SPLAENet for stance prediction in misinformative social media content. It utilizes a dual cross-attention mechanism and hierarchical attention network to capture relationships within and between texts. Emotions are incorporated to differentiate between stance categories based on emotional alignment or divergence. Label fusion with distance-metric learning aligns features with stance labels for improved accuracy. Extensive experiments show SPLAENet outperforms existing methods, with significant gains in accuracy and F1-score on datasets like RumourEval, SemEval, and P-stance. The average improvements demonstrate SPLAENet's effectiveness in detecting stances in the context of misinformation on social media.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has generated an overwhelming volume of user-generated content, conveying implicit opinions and contributing to the spread of misinformation. The method aims to enhance the detection of stance where misinformation can polarize user opinions. Stance detection has emerged as a crucial approach to effectively analyze underlying biases in shared information and combating misinformation. This paper proposes a novel method for \textbf{S}tance \textbf{P}rediction through a \textbf{L}abel-fused dual cross-\textbf{A}ttentive \textbf{E}motion-aware neural \textbf{Net}work (SPLAENet) in misinformative social media user-generated content. The proposed method employs a dual cross-attention mechanism and a hierarchical attention network to capture inter and intra-relationships by focusing on the relevant parts of source text in the context of reply text and vice versa. We incorporate emotions to effectively distinguish between different stance categories by leveraging the emotional alignment or divergence between the texts. We also employ label fusion that uses distance-metric learning to align extracted features with stance labels, improving the method's ability to accurately distinguish between stances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by SPLAENet over existing state-of-the-art methods. SPLAENet demonstrates an average gain of 8.92\% in accuracy and 17.36\% in F1-score on the RumourEval dataset. On the SemEval dataset, it achieves average gains of 7.02\% in accuracy and 10.92\% in F1-score. On the P-stance dataset, it demonstrates average gains of 10.03\% in accuracy and 11.18\% in F1-score. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for stance detection in the context of misinformative social media content.

Summary: 
PROSE is introduced as a method to improve the precision of inferred preference descriptions in LLMs acting as writing agents. It incorporates iterative refinement and verification of inferred preferences across multiple user writing samples. Testing PROSE with various LLMs on summarization and email writing tasks shows a 33% enhancement in accurately inferring nuanced human preferences compared to the state-of-the-art method CIPHER. The combination of PROSE and ICL, another preference inference method, results in a 9% improvement over using ICL alone. This research emphasizes the importance of accommodating individual human preferences to create aligned LLM agents that can deliver personalized and effective interactions. <div>
arXiv:2505.23815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accommodating human preferences is essential for creating aligned LLM agents that deliver personalized and effective interactions. Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs acting as writing agents to infer a description of user preferences. Agent alignment then comes from conditioning on the inferred preference description. However, existing methods often produce generic preference descriptions that fail to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PROSE, a method designed to enhance the precision of preference descriptions inferred from user writing samples. PROSE incorporates two key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, and (2) verification of inferred preferences across multiple user writing samples. We evaluate PROSE with several LLMs (i.e., Qwen2.5 7B and 72B Instruct, GPT-mini, and GPT-4o) on a summarization and an email writing task. We find that PROSE more accurately infers nuanced human preferences, improving the quality of the writing agent's generations over CIPHER (a state-of-the-art method for inferring preferences) by 33\%. Lastly, we demonstrate that ICL and PROSE are complementary methods, and combining them provides up to a 9\% improvement over ICL alone.

<div> Keywords: large language models, steerability, text-rewriting, prompt engineering, reinforcement learning

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the concept of steerability in large language models (LLMs) and investigates whether these models can reliably produce outputs aligned with user goals. The study introduces a framework that evaluates LLM outputs based on a multi-dimensional goal space representing different text attributes. Results show that current LLMs struggle with steerability due to poor coverage, miscalibration, and persistent side effects in text rewriting tasks. Various interventions, such as prompt engineering and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, are explored to improve steerability, but side effects remain a challenge. The findings suggest that even strong LLMs face difficulties in aligning outputs with diverse user goals, indicating the need for more effective alignment strategies. The steerability evaluation framework used in the study is open-sourced for further research and development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning and instruction-following benchmarks, it remains unclear whether they can reliably produce outputs aligned with a broad variety of user goals, a concept we refer to as steerability. The abundance of methods proposed to modify LLM behavior makes it unclear whether current LLMs are already steerable, or require further intervention. In particular, LLMs may exhibit (i) poor coverage, where rare user goals are underrepresented; (ii) miscalibration, where models overshoot requests; and (iii) side effects, where changes to one dimension of text inadvertently affect others. To systematically evaluate these failures, we introduce a framework based on a multi-dimensional goal space that models user goals and LLM outputs as vectors with dimensions corresponding to text attributes (e.g., reading difficulty). Applied to a text-rewriting task, we find that current LLMs struggle with steerability, as side effects are persistent. Interventions to improve steerability, such as prompt engineering, best-of-$N$ sampling, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, have varying effectiveness, yet side effects remain problematic. Our findings suggest that even strong LLMs struggle with steerability, and existing alignment strategies may be insufficient. We open-source our steerability evaluation framework at https://github.com/MLD3/steerability.

Abstract: Automated answer grading is a critical challenge in educational technology, with the potential to streamline assessment processes, ensure grading consistency, and provide timely feedback to students. However, existing approaches are often constrained to specific exam formats, lack interpretability in score assignment, and struggle with real-world applicability across diverse subjects and assessment types. To address these limitations, we introduce RATAS (Rubric Automated Tree-based Answer Scoring), a novel framework that leverages state-of-the-art generative AI models for rubric-based grading of textual responses. RATAS is designed to support a wide range of grading rubrics, enable subject-agnostic evaluation, and generate structured, explainable rationales for assigned scores. We formalize the automatic grading task through a mathematical framework tailored to rubric-based assessment and present an architecture capable of handling complex, real-world exam structures. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we construct a unique, contextualized dataset derived from real-world project-based courses, encompassing diverse response formats and varying levels of complexity. Empirical results demonstrate that RATAS achieves high reliability and accuracy in automated grading while providing interpretable feedback that enhances transparency for both students and nstructors.

<div> Keywords: LLMs, aligning, biases, limitations, ambivalent scenarios

Summary: 
This study investigates the biases and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in three distinct roles: answer generator, judge, and debater. The research focuses on the ability of LLMs to replicate human judgments and preferences, especially in scenarios where humans disagree. A "no-consensus" benchmark was developed to evaluate LLM performance in ambivalent scenarios with conflicting stances. The results indicate that while LLMs excel at providing nuanced answers, they struggle to remain neutral in judgment and debate tasks, often taking a stance on topics where human consensus is lacking. These findings emphasize the need for more advanced alignment methods for LLMs to operate autonomously without human oversight. The study underscores the challenge of capturing human disagreement accurately, even on contentious issues where divergent viewpoints exist.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of LLMs as substitutes for humans in ``aligning'' LLMs has raised questions about their ability to replicate human judgments and preferences, especially in ambivalent scenarios where humans disagree. This study examines the biases and limitations of LLMs in three roles: answer generator, judge, and debater. These roles loosely correspond to previously described alignment frameworks: preference alignment (judge) and scalable oversight (debater), with the answer generator reflecting the typical setting with user interactions. We develop a ``no-consensus'' benchmark by curating examples that encompass a variety of a priori ambivalent scenarios, each presenting two possible stances. Our results show that while LLMs can provide nuanced assessments when generating open-ended answers, they tend to take a stance on no-consensus topics when employed as judges or debaters. These findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated methods for aligning LLMs without human oversight, highlighting that LLMs cannot fully capture human disagreement even on topics where humans themselves are divided.

This study explores the use of speech data as a trimodal multimedia source for detecting depression in adolescents. By leveraging language model-based architectures, the study integrates text, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers for depression prediction. It also incorporates multi-task learning to simultaneously predict depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances. A longitudinal analysis strategy is proposed to capture temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions, providing a comprehensive understanding of condition progression. The proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal multi-task learning, is evaluated on the Depression Early Warning dataset and achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%, outperforming unimodal and non-longitudinal methods. <div>

Abstract: Speech is a noninvasive digital phenotype that can offer valuable insights into mental health conditions, but it is often treated as a single modality. In contrast, we propose the treatment of patient speech data as a trimodal multimedia data source for depression detection. This study explores the potential of large language model-based architectures for speech-based depression prediction in a multimodal regime that integrates speech-derived text, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers. Adolescent depression presents a significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional opportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by simultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances using the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis strategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the Depression Early Warning dataset. It achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%, which is higher than each of the unimodal, single-task, and non-longitudinal methods.

The article introduces the RAG Benchmark for PPIs (RAGPPI), a dataset consisting of 4,420 question-answer pairs related to the biological impacts of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). This benchmark addresses the need for efficient target identification in drug development by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks. Criteria for the dataset were established through expert interviews, leading to the creation of a gold-standard dataset of 500 QA pairs. An ensemble auto-evaluation LLM was developed to generate a silver-standard dataset of 3,720 QA pairs. The RAGPPI dataset aims to support the research community in advancing RAG systems for drug discovery QA solutions. This resource provides a valuable tool for researchers in the field to enhance the understanding and application of PPIs in drug development.

Abstract: Retrieving the biological impacts of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is essential for target identification (Target ID) in drug development. Given the vast number of proteins involved, this process remains time-consuming and challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks have supported Target ID; however, no benchmark currently exists for identifying the biological impacts of PPIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the RAG Benchmark for PPIs (RAGPPI), a factual question-answer benchmark of 4,420 question-answer pairs that focus on the potential biological impacts of PPIs. Through interviews with experts, we identified criteria for a benchmark dataset, such as a type of QA and source. We built a gold-standard dataset (500 QA pairs) through expert-driven data annotation. We developed an ensemble auto-evaluation LLM that reflected expert labeling characteristics, which facilitates the construction of a silver-standard dataset (3,720 QA pairs). We are committed to maintaining RAGPPI as a resource to support the research community in advancing RAG systems for drug discovery QA solutions.

Summary:
ValueSim is a framework designed to simulate individual values by generating personal backstories based on past experiences and demographic information. It utilizes a multi-module architecture inspired by the Cognitive-Affective Personality System to simulate values from these narratives. Testing on a benchmark derived from the World Values Survey shows an accuracy improvement of over 10% compared to other methods. The model's performance improves with more user interaction history, indicating its ability to enhance persona simulation over time. This approach fills a gap in aligning Large Language Models with individualized human values, focusing on simulating diverse value systems rather than just broad ethical considerations. <div>
arXiv:2505.23827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit increasingly human-like capabilities, aligning them with human values has become critically important. Contemporary advanced techniques, such as prompt learning and reinforcement learning, are being deployed to better align LLMs with human values. However, while these approaches address broad ethical considerations and helpfulness, they rarely focus on simulating individualized human value systems. To address this gap, we present ValueSim, a framework that simulates individual values through the generation of personal backstories reflecting past experiences and demographic information. ValueSim converts structured individual data into narrative backstories and employs a multi-module architecture inspired by the Cognitive-Affective Personality System to simulate individual values based on these narratives. Testing ValueSim on a self-constructed benchmark derived from the World Values Survey demonstrates an improvement in top-1 accuracy by over 10% compared to retrieval-augmented generation methods. Further analysis reveals that performance enhances as additional user interaction history becomes available, indicating the model's ability to refine its persona simulation capabilities over time.

Summary: 
The paper introduces BiasFilter, a novel framework for mitigating social bias in large language models (LLMs) at inference time. Unlike existing methods, BiasFilter does not require retraining or parameter modification, instead integrating seamlessly with open-source and API-based LLMs. It filters generation outputs in real time by evaluating intermediate outputs periodically, maintaining a set of candidate continuations, and discarding low-reward segments based on a fairness reward signal. A fairness preference dataset is used to train an implicit reward model for assessing token-level fairness in generated responses. The framework effectively mitigates social bias in a variety of LLMs while maintaining overall generation quality. <div>
arXiv:2505.23829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigating social bias in large language models (LLMs) has become an increasingly important research objective. However, existing debiasing methods often incur high human and computational costs, exhibit limited effectiveness, and struggle to scale to larger models and open-ended generation tasks. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BiasFilter, a model-agnostic, inference-time debiasing framework that integrates seamlessly with both open-source and API-based LLMs. Instead of relying on retraining with balanced data or modifying model parameters, BiasFilter enforces fairness by filtering generation outputs in real time. Specifically, it periodically evaluates intermediate outputs every few tokens, maintains an active set of candidate continuations, and incrementally completes generation by discarding low-reward segments based on a fairness reward signal. To support this process, we construct a fairness preference dataset and train an implicit reward model to assess token-level fairness in generated responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiasFilter effectively mitigates social bias across a range of LLMs while preserving overall generation quality.

It introduces an expert evolution strategy to create diverse experts from a single trainable expert, combating homogenization. Additionally, it features the Dynamic Token-aware Router (DTR) that uses hypernetworks to dynamically assign input tokens to appropriate experts based on modality and token values. Through extensive experiments, EvoMoE has shown superior performance on various multi-modal benchmarks compared to other sparse MLLMs, including MME, MMBench, TextVQA, and POPE. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoMoE in enhancing MLLM performance by overcoming key challenges in MoE techniques.

Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach significantly enhances the capacity of large language models (LLMs) and improves performance on downstream tasks. Building on these promising results, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have increasingly adopted MoE techniques. However, existing multi-modal MoE tuning methods typically face two key challenges: expert uniformity and router rigidity. Expert uniformity occurs because MoE experts are often initialized by simply replicating the FFN parameters from LLMs, leading to homogenized expert functions and weakening the intended diversification of the MoE architecture. Meanwhile, router rigidity stems from the prevalent use of static linear routers for expert selection, which fail to distinguish between visual and textual tokens, resulting in similar expert distributions for image and text. To address these limitations, we propose EvoMoE, an innovative MoE tuning framework. EvoMoE introduces a meticulously designed expert initialization strategy that progressively evolves multiple robust experts from a single trainable expert, a process termed expert evolution that specifically targets severe expert homogenization. Furthermore, we introduce the Dynamic Token-aware Router (DTR), a novel routing mechanism that allocates input tokens to appropriate experts based on their modality and intrinsic token values. This dynamic routing is facilitated by hypernetworks, which dynamically generate routing weights tailored for each individual token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EvoMoE significantly outperforms other sparse MLLMs across a variety of multi-modal benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, TextVQA, and POPE. Our results highlight the effectiveness of EvoMoE in enhancing the performance of MLLMs by addressing the critical issues of expert uniformity and router rigidity.

Abstract: The intangible cultural heritage (ICH) of China, a cultural asset transmitted across generations by various ethnic groups, serves as a significant testament to the evolution of human civilization and holds irreplaceable value for the preservation of historical lineage and the enhancement of cultural self-confidence. However, the rapid pace of modernization poses formidable challenges to ICH, including threats damage, disappearance and discontinuity of inheritance. China has the highest number of items on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List, which is indicative of the nation's abundant cultural resources and emphasises the pressing need for ICH preservation. In recent years, the rapid advancements in large language modelling have provided a novel technological approach for the preservation and dissemination of ICH. This study utilises a substantial corpus of open-source Chinese ICH data to develop a large language model, ICH-Qwen, for the ICH domain. The model employs natural language understanding and knowledge reasoning capabilities of large language models, augmented with synthetic data and fine-tuning techniques. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of ICH-Qwen in executing tasks specific to the ICH domain. It is anticipated that the model will provide intelligent solutions for the protection, inheritance and dissemination of intangible cultural heritage, as well as new theoretical and practical references for the sustainable development of intangible cultural heritage. Furthermore, it is expected that the study will open up new paths for digital humanities research.

<div> benchmark, legal case retrieval, large-scale, legal element reasoning, constrained decoding

Summary: 
The article introduces LEGAR BENCH, a large-scale Korean Legal Case Retrieval (LCR) benchmark covering 411 crime types in queries over 1.2 million legal cases. It addresses the limitations of existing studies by providing a more comprehensive evaluation on a diverse range of queries. LegalSearchLM, a retrieval model introduced in the study, outperforms baseline methods by 6-20% on LEGAR BENCH, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The model utilizes legal element reasoning over the query case and generates content directly grounded in the target cases through constrained decoding. Additionally, LegalSearchLM demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain cases, outperforming generative models trained only on in-domain data by 15%. This research contributes to advancing the field of Legal Case Retrieval by providing a more extensive benchmark and a novel retrieval model that improves performance in complex legal scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal Case Retrieval (LCR), which retrieves relevant cases from a query case, is a fundamental task for legal professionals in research and decision-making. However, existing studies on LCR face two major limitations. First, they are evaluated on relatively small-scale retrieval corpora (e.g., 100-55K cases) and use a narrow range of criminal query types, which cannot sufficiently reflect the complexity of real-world legal retrieval scenarios. Second, their reliance on embedding-based or lexical matching methods often results in limited representations and legally irrelevant matches. To address these issues, we present: (1) LEGAR BENCH, the first large-scale Korean LCR benchmark, covering 411 diverse crime types in queries over 1.2M legal cases; and (2) LegalSearchLM, a retrieval model that performs legal element reasoning over the query case and directly generates content grounded in the target cases through constrained decoding. Experimental results show that LegalSearchLM outperforms baselines by 6-20% on LEGAR BENCH, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain cases, outperforming naive generative models trained on in-domain data by 15%.

<div> abstract reasoning, Large Language Models, benchmark, mathematic framework, symbol remapping  
Summary:  
The paper presents a new benchmark for assessing abstract reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) through a mathematic framework defining abstract reasoning and introducing two metrics, \(\scoreGamma\) and \(\scoreDelta\). The benchmark involves systematic symbol remapping in rule-based tasks to test pattern recognition beyond token matching. Evaluations on various LLMs reveal limitations in non-decimal arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, persistent abstraction gaps despite prompting, and the effectiveness of \(\scoreDelta\) in measuring memory dependence. The findings emphasize the need for improving LLMs' abstract reasoning capabilities.  
<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.23833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to establish a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded benchmark for rigorously probing abstract reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). To achieve this, we first develop a mathematic framework that defines abstract reasoning as the ability to: (i) extract essential patterns independent of surface representations, and (ii) apply consistent rules to these abstract patterns. Based on this framework, we introduce two novel complementary metrics: \(\scoreGamma\) measures basic reasoning accuracy, while \(\scoreDelta\) quantifies a model's reliance on specific symbols rather than underlying patterns - a key indicator of true abstraction versus mere memorization. To implement this measurement, we design a benchmark: systematic symbol remapping in rule-based tasks, which forces models to demonstrate genuine pattern recognition beyond superficial token matching. Extensive LLM evaluations using this benchmark (commercial API models, 7B-70B, multi-agent) reveal:1) critical limitations in non-decimal arithmetic and symbolic reasoning; 2) persistent abstraction gaps despite chain-of-thought prompting; and 3) \(\scoreDelta\)'s effectiveness in robustly measuring memory dependence by quantifying performance degradation under symbol remapping, particularly highlighting operand-specific memorization. These findings underscore that current LLMs, despite domain-specific strengths, still lack robust abstract reasoning, highlighting key areas for future improvement.

Summary:
LACE, the Language-based Access Control Engine, aims to address the complexity of access control in the Internet of Things (IoT) by bridging the gap between human intent and machine-enforceable logic. It utilizes large language models (LLMs) to enable users to specify access policies in natural language, which are then automatically translated into structured rules for validation and enforcement. LACE combines prompt-guided policy generation, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and formal validation to support expressive, interpretable, and verifiable access control in IoT environments. The system achieved 100% correctness in verified policy generation and demonstrated up to 88% decision accuracy with 0.79 F1-score, outperforming baseline models such as GPT-3.5 and Gemini. Furthermore, LACE exhibited strong scalability in handling increasing policy volume and request concurrency, showcasing its potential to provide secure, flexible, and user-friendly access control for real-world IoT platforms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access control in the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming increasingly complex, as policies must account for dynamic and contextual factors such as time, location, user behavior, and environmental conditions. However, existing platforms either offer only coarse-grained controls or rely on rigid rule matching, making them ill-suited for semantically rich or ambiguous access scenarios. Moreover, the policy authoring process remains fragmented: domain experts describe requirements in natural language, but developers must manually translate them into code, introducing semantic gaps and potential misconfiguration. In this work, we present LACE, the Language-based Access Control Engine, a hybrid framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap between human intent and machine-enforceable logic. LACE combines prompt-guided policy generation, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and formal validation to support expressive, interpretable, and verifiable access control. It enables users to specify policies in natural language, automatically translates them into structured rules, validates semantic correctness, and makes access decisions using a hybrid LLM-rule-based engine. We evaluate LACE in smart home environments through extensive experiments. LACE achieves 100% correctness in verified policy generation and up to 88% decision accuracy with 0.79 F1-score using DeepSeek-V3, outperforming baselines such as GPT-3.5 and Gemini. The system also demonstrates strong scalability under increasing policy volume and request concurrency. Our results highlight LACE's potential to enable secure, flexible, and user-friendly access control across real-world IoT platforms.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of $0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman, level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future models.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach, CoMaPOI, to improve next Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction using Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs face challenges in understanding numeric spatiotemporal data and predicting from an extensive candidate POI space. CoMaPOI addresses these challenges with three specialized agents: Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor. The Profiler agent converts numeric data into language descriptions for semantic understanding, while the Forecaster agent refines the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent integrates this information to make accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that CoMaPOI outperforms existing methods by 5% to 10%. This work pioneers the use of collaborative agents to tackle the complexities of applying LLMs to spatiotemporal tasks. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for the next Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction task, leveraging their capabilities in semantic understanding of POI trajectories. However, previous LLM-based methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task. Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor), CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions, enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to 10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by leveraging tailored collaborative agents.

Summary:
The study introduces SYCON Bench, a benchmark for assessing sycophantic behavior in multi-turn conversational settings. It evaluates how quickly models conform to users (Turn of Flip) and how often they change their stance under user pressure (Number of Flip). Results show that sycophancy is common among Large Language Models, with alignment tuning exacerbating this behavior. Model scaling and reasoning optimization help models resist undesired user views, but reasoning models can struggle if they prioritize logical exposition over addressing user beliefs directly. The study also evaluates prompting strategies, finding that a third-person perspective can significantly reduce sycophancy in debate scenarios by up to 63.8%. Overall, the research highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating sycophantic tendencies in AI models for more ethical and accurate interactions with users.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to provide helpful and harmless responses, yet they often exhibit sycophancy--conforming to user beliefs regardless of factual accuracy or ethical soundness. Prior research on sycophancy has primarily focused on single-turn factual correctness, overlooking the dynamics of real-world interactions. In this work, we introduce SYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in multi-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how quickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it shifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying SYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that sycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode. Our analysis shows that alignment tuning amplifies sycophantic behavior, whereas model scaling and reasoning optimization strengthen the model's ability to resist undesirable user views. Reasoning models generally outperform instruction-tuned models but often fail when they over-index on logical exposition instead of directly addressing the user's underlying beliefs. Finally, we evaluate four additional prompting strategies and demonstrate that adopting a third-person perspective reduces sycophancy by up to 63.8% in debate scenario. We release our code and data at https://github.com/JiseungHong/SYCON-Bench.

Summary: 
This article addresses the issue of credit attribution and compensation in Large Language Models (LLMs) that generate summaries using content from multiple sources. The proposed solution involves using Shapley values, a game-theoretic method that allocates credit based on each document's contribution. To improve computational efficiency, the authors introduce Cluster Shapley, which clusters documents based on semantic similarity and computes Shapley values at the cluster level. This approach significantly reduces computation while maintaining attribution quality. In a summarization task using Amazon product reviews, Cluster Shapley outperforms baseline methods such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP, demonstrating its effectiveness in various summarization settings. The method is versatile and can be applied to different LLMs, summarization processes, and evaluation procedures.  <div>
arXiv:2505.23842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve and summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI assistants. While these models enhance user experience by generating coherent summaries, they obscure the contributions of original content creators, raising concerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of valuing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries. We propose using Shapley values, a game-theoretic method that allocates credit based on each document's marginal contribution. Although theoretically appealing, Shapley values are expensive to compute at scale. We therefore propose Cluster Shapley, an efficient approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity between documents. By clustering documents using LLM-based embeddings and computing Shapley values at the cluster level, our method significantly reduces computation while maintaining attribution quality. We demonstrate our approach to a summarization task using Amazon product reviews. Cluster Shapley significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP with a better efficient frontier. Our approach is agnostic to the exact LLM used, the summarization process used, and the evaluation procedure, which makes it broadly applicable to a variety of summarization settings.

Abstract: Multi-round incomplete information tasks are crucial for evaluating the lateral thinking capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Currently, research primarily relies on multiple benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics to assess these abilities. However, our study reveals novel insights into the limitations of existing methods, as they often yield misleading results that fail to uncover key issues, such as shortcut-taking behaviors, rigid patterns, and premature task termination. These issues obscure the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs and undermine the reliability of evaluations. To address these limitations, we propose a refined set of evaluation standards, including inspection of reasoning paths, diversified assessment metrics, and comparative analyses with human performance.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a framework for combining knowledge from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a stronger model. It addresses challenges faced in traditional fine-tuning methods by proposing an adaptive selection network that identifies the most relevant source LLMs based on their scores to reduce interference among tasks. Additionally, a dynamic weighted fusion strategy is introduced to leverage the strengths of different LLMs. A feedback-driven loss function prevents the selector from converging on a single subset of sources, ensuring a more stable aggregation process. Experimental results show a significant reduction in knowledge interference compared to existing approaches, making the proposed method more scalable and effective for integrating capabilities from diverse LLMs. The code for the framework is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.23844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise but remain challenging to continually improve through traditional finetuning, particularly when integrating capabilities from other specialized LLMs. Popular methods like ensemble and weight merging require substantial memory and struggle to adapt to changing data environments. Recent efforts have transferred knowledge from multiple LLMs into a single target model; however, they suffer from interference and degraded performance among tasks, largely due to limited flexibility in candidate selection and training pipelines. To address these issues, we propose a framework that adaptively selects and aggregates knowledge from diverse LLMs to build a single, stronger model, avoiding the high memory overhead of ensemble and inflexible weight merging. Specifically, we design an adaptive selection network that identifies the most relevant source LLMs based on their scores, thereby reducing knowledge interference. We further propose a dynamic weighted fusion strategy that accounts for the inherent strengths of candidate LLMs, along with a feedback-driven loss function that prevents the selector from converging on a single subset of sources. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can enable a more stable and scalable knowledge aggregation process while reducing knowledge interference by up to 50% compared to existing approaches.

Summary: 
The study focuses on analyzing the source of uncertainty in DeepSeek R1-32B during question answering tasks. The model tends to be overconfident in its default setting, but semantic entropy, derived from sampling multiple responses, remains reliable. By allowing the model to explore its predictive distribution through a longer chain-of-thought process before providing an answer, its verbal score effectiveness improves. This improvement extends to simple fact-retrieval questions that typically do not require reasoning. Additionally, a separate reader model that only views the chain-of-thought can accurately reconstruct similar confidences, suggesting that verbal scores may be based on the alternatives considered during reasoning. The analysis highlights the importance of explicitly exploring the generative space for reliable uncertainty estimation, with self-reported confidence being trustworthy only after such exploration. <div>

Abstract: We study the source of uncertainty in DeepSeek R1-32B by analyzing its self-reported verbal confidence on question answering (QA) tasks. In the default answer-then-confidence setting, the model is regularly over-confident, whereas semantic entropy - obtained by sampling many responses - remains reliable. We hypothesize that this is because of semantic entropy's larger test-time compute, which lets us explore the model's predictive distribution. We show that granting DeepSeek the budget to explore its distribution by forcing a long chain-of-thought before the final answer greatly improves its verbal score effectiveness, even on simple fact-retrieval questions that normally require no reasoning. Furthermore, a separate reader model that sees only the chain can reconstruct very similar confidences, indicating the verbal score might be merely a statistic of the alternatives surfaced during reasoning. Our analysis concludes that reliable uncertainty estimation requires explicit exploration of the generative space, and self-reported confidence is trustworthy only after such exploration.

The PDES framework integrates the passage of time, with each agent responding to requests from others in a rule-based manner. This coupling mechanism allows for cooperative work towards a common goal, with tasks running in parallel. Non-AI agents apply dynamic constraints to AI outputs, enabling scalability with hundreds of agents in a compute cluster. The approach breaks down problems into structured steps, providing choices to AI agents and verifying actions with non-AI agents. Evaluation on four different domain problems showed a 68% accuracy rate with the proposed approach, compared to less than 23% with AI models alone. <div>

Abstract: To fully leverage the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in a trustworthy manner, it is desirable to couple multiple AI and non-AI systems together seamlessly for constraining and ensuring correctness of the output. This paper introduces a novel parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) based methodology to combine multiple AI and non-AI agents in a causal, rule-based way. Our approach tightly integrates the concept of passage of time, with each agent considered as an entity in the PDES framework and responding to prior requests from other agents. Such coupling mechanism enables the agents to work in a co-operative environment towards a common goal while many tasks run in parallel throughout the simulation. It further enables setting up boundaries to the outputs of the AI agents by applying necessary dynamic constraints using non-AI agents while allowing for scalability through deployment of hundreds of such agents in a larger compute cluster. Distributing smaller AI agents can enable extremely scalable simulations in the future, addressing local memory bottlenecks for model parameter storage. Within a PDES involving both AI and non-AI agents, we break down the problem at hand into structured steps, when necessary, providing a set of multiple choices to the AI agents, and then progressively solve these steps towards a final goal. At each step, the non-AI agents act as unbiased auditors, verifying each action by the AI agents so that certain rules of engagement are followed. We evaluate our approach by solving four problems from four different domains and comparing the results with those from AI models alone. Our results show greater accuracy in solving problems from various domains where the AI models struggle to solve the problems solely by themselves. Results show that overall accuracy of our approach is 68% where as the accuracy of vanilla models is less than 23%.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, refusal rates, sensitive content, token sequence, generation.

Summary: 
This study introduces a method to reduce refusal rates of large language models (LLMs) when generating responses to sensitive content. By analyzing specific token sequences that often precede refusals, such as the beginning of a chain-of-thought (CoT) block and double newline tokens, the researchers identified key points during generation where interventions could be made to increase the proportion of substantive answers. By suppressing certain tokens at strategic points, the researchers were able to improve the quality of responses to sensitive prompts without affecting performance on standard benchmarks. This method does not require any changes to the model's weights or prompts and solely relies on modifying token probabilities during generation. The findings suggest that refusal behaviors can be circumvented by blocking refusal subspaces at specific points in the generation process.

Abstract: We introduce a method to reduce refusal rates of large language models (LLMs) on sensitive content without modifying model weights or prompts. Motivated by the observation that refusals in certain models were often preceded by the specific token sequence of a token marking the beginning of the chain-of-thought (CoT) block () followed by a double newline token (\n\n), we investigate the impact of two simple formatting adjustments during generation: suppressing \n\n after  and suppressing the end-of-sequence token after the end of the CoT block (). Our method requires no datasets, parameter changes, or training, relying solely on modifying token probabilities during generation. In our experiments with official DeepSeek-R1 distillations, these interventions increased the proportion of substantive answers to sensitive prompts without affecting performance on standard benchmarks. Our findings suggest that refusal behaviors can be circumvented by blocking refusal subspaces at specific points in the generation process.

<div> symbolic manipulation, assessment framework, large language models, integration, differential equations <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces ASyMOB, an assessment framework focusing on symbolic manipulation to evaluate the proficiency of large language models (LLMs) in symbolic mathematics. Existing benchmarks do not adequately assess key skills such as integration, differential equations, and algebraic simplification. ASyMOB consists of 17,092 unique math challenges organized by similarity and complexity. LLMs show a decline in performance when faced with perturbations, indicating reliance on memorized patterns rather than a deep understanding of symbolic math. Models with integrated code execution perform better, stabilizing weaker models. Advanced LLMs like o4-mini and Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibit high symbolic math proficiency and robustness against perturbations, suggesting a potential "phase transition" in LLM generalization capabilities. The future direction may involve deeper integration with external tools or further advancements in LLM capabilities to render computer algebra systems unnecessary. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly approaching the level of proficiency in university-level symbolic mathematics required for applications in advanced science and technology. However, existing benchmarks fall short in assessing the core skills of LLMs in symbolic mathematics-such as integration, differential equations, and algebraic simplification. To address this gap, we introduce ASyMOB, a novel assessment framework focused exclusively on symbolic manipulation, featuring 17,092 unique math challenges, organized by similarity and complexity. ASyMOB enables analysis of LLM generalization capabilities by comparing performance in problems that differ by simple numerical or symbolic `perturbations'. Evaluated LLMs exhibit substantial degradation in performance for all perturbation types (up to -70.3%), suggesting reliance on memorized patterns rather than deeper understanding of symbolic math, even among models achieving high baseline accuracy. Comparing LLM performance to computer algebra systems, we identify examples where they fail while LLMs succeed, as well as problems solved only by combining both approaches. Models capable of integrated code execution yielded higher accuracy compared to their performance without code, particularly stabilizing weaker models (up to +33.1% for certain perturbation types). Notably, the most advanced models (o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash) demonstrate not only high symbolic math proficiency (scoring 96.8% and 97.6% on the unperturbed set), but also remarkable robustness against perturbations, (-21.7% and -21.2% vs. average -50.4% for the other models). This may indicate a recent "phase transition" in the generalization capabilities of frontier LLMs. It remains to be seen whether the path forward lies in deeper integration with sophisticated external tools, or in developing models so capable that symbolic math systems like CAS become unnecessary.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Autonomous Agents, Reproducibility, Alzheimer's, Biomedical Research

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) were used as autonomous agents to replicate findings from published Alzheimer's research studies using the NACC dataset. A simulated research team of LLM agents was created to reproduce findings using study Abstracts, Methods sections, and data dictionary descriptions. The LLM agents were able to reproduce approximately 53.2% of findings per study on average, but discrepancies in numeric values and statistical methods were observed. Some findings were replicated accurately while others failed due to implementation flaws or missing methodological detail. This study demonstrates the potential of LLM-based systems in automating reproducibility assessments in biomedical research but also highlights the current limitations in fully automating the process. Further research is needed to improve the accuracy and reliability of LLMs in reproducing scientific findings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To demonstrate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents to reproduce findings of published research studies using the same or similar dataset.
  Materials and Methods: We used the "Quick Access" dataset of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). We identified highly cited published research manuscripts using NACC data and selected five studies that appeared reproducible using this dataset alone. Using GPT-4o, we created a simulated research team of LLM-based autonomous agents tasked with writing and executing code to dynamically reproduce the findings of each study, given only study Abstracts, Methods sections, and data dictionary descriptions of the dataset.
  Results: We extracted 35 key findings described in the Abstracts across 5 Alzheimer's studies. On average, LLM agents approximately reproduced 53.2% of findings per study. Numeric values and range-based findings often differed between studies and agents. The agents also applied statistical methods or parameters that varied from the originals, though overall trends and significance were sometimes similar.
  Discussion: In some cases, LLM-based agents replicated research techniques and findings. In others, they failed due to implementation flaws or missing methodological detail. These discrepancies show the current limits of LLMs in fully automating reproducibility assessments. Still, this early investigation highlights the potential of structured agent-based systems to provide scalable evaluation of scientific rigor.
  Conclusion: This exploratory work illustrates both the promise and limitations of LLMs as autonomous agents for automating reproducibility in biomedical research.

<div> uncertainty estimation, language models, calibration, selective classification, MMLU-Pro benchmark
<br />
Summary:<br />Large language models (LLMs) require robust uncertainty estimation for safe deployment. A comprehensive study evaluated 80 models across various architectures and scales. Three uncertainty estimation methods were compared on a challenging benchmark, with linguistic verbal uncertainty (LVU) showing superior calibration and discrimination. Accuracy does not guarantee reliable uncertainty estimates, influenced by model scale, post-training, reasoning ability, and quantization. LVU outperformed token probability-based and numerical verbal uncertainty methods. LLMs performed better on reasoning tasks than knowledge-heavy ones. Good calibration doesn't always lead to effective error ranking. Multi-perspective evaluation is crucial, with LVU identified as a practical tool for enhancing LLM reliability in real-world applications.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.23854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications, robust uncertainty estimation is essential for ensuring the safe and trustworthy deployment of LLMs. We present the most comprehensive study to date of uncertainty estimation in LLMs, evaluating 80 models spanning open- and closed-source families, dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, reasoning and non-reasoning modes, quantization variants and parameter scales from 0.6B to 671B. Focusing on three representative black-box single-pass methods, including token probability-based uncertainty (TPU), numerical verbal uncertainty (NVU), and linguistic verbal uncertainty (LVU), we systematically evaluate uncertainty calibration and selective classification using the challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark, which covers both reasoning-intensive and knowledge-based tasks. Our results show that LVU consistently outperforms TPU and NVU, offering stronger calibration and discrimination while being more interpretable. We also find that high accuracy does not imply reliable uncertainty, and that model scale, post-training, reasoning ability and quantization all influence estimation performance. Notably, LLMs exhibit better uncertainty estimates on reasoning tasks than on knowledge-heavy ones, and good calibration does not necessarily translate to effective error ranking. These findings highlight the need for multi-perspective evaluation and position LVU as a practical tool for improving the reliability of LLMs in real-world settings.

<div> Keywords: large language models, harmful prompts detection, multilingual, image-based prompts, audio-based prompts <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces OMNIGUARD, a novel approach for detecting harmful prompts in large language models (LLMs) across different languages and modalities. The approach identifies aligned internal representations in LLMs and uses them to build a language-agnostic or modality-agnostic classifier for detecting harmful prompts. OMNIGUARD improves classification accuracy significantly in multilingual settings, image-based prompts, and audio-based prompts, outperforming the strongest baseline methods. Additionally, the approach sets a new state-of-the-art for audio-based prompts. OMNIGUARD is highly efficient, being approximately 120 times faster than the next fastest baseline method. The code and data for OMNIGUARD are publicly available, enabling further research and development in the field of harmful prompt detection in LLMs. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked concerns about their immediate potential for harmful misuse. The core approach to mitigate these concerns is the detection of harmful queries to the model. Current detection approaches are fallible, and are particularly susceptible to attacks that exploit mismatched generalization of model capabilities (e.g., prompts in low-resource languages or prompts provided in non-text modalities such as image and audio). To tackle this challenge, we propose OMNIGUARD, an approach for detecting harmful prompts across languages and modalities. Our approach (i) identifies internal representations of an LLM/MLLM that are aligned across languages or modalities and then (ii) uses them to build a language-agnostic or modality-agnostic classifier for detecting harmful prompts. OMNIGUARD improves harmful prompt classification accuracy by 11.57\% over the strongest baseline in a multilingual setting, by 20.44\% for image-based prompts, and sets a new SOTA for audio-based prompts. By repurposing embeddings computed during generation, OMNIGUARD is also very efficient ($\approx 120 \times$ faster than the next fastest baseline). Code and data are available at: https://github.com/vsahil/OmniGuard.

Summary: <br />
Infi-Med is a framework designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in healthcare. It addresses challenges such as resource efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, clinical considerations, and ethical privacy. The framework introduces innovations in three key areas: a resource-efficient approach through high-quality supervised fine-tuning datasets, enhanced multimodal reasoning capabilities for cross-modal integration, and a systematic evaluation system for model performance assessment. In experiments, Infi-Med demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in general medical reasoning and rapid adaptability to clinical scenarios. By balancing model effectiveness with operational constraints, Infi-Med paves the way for the practical deployment of MLLMs in real-world healthcare settings. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising prospects in healthcare, particularly for addressing complex medical tasks, supporting multidisciplinary treatment (MDT), and enabling personalized precision medicine. However, their practical deployment faces critical challenges in resource efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, clinical considerations, and ethical privacy. To address these limitations, we propose Infi-Med, a comprehensive framework for medical MLLMs that introduces three key innovations: (1) a resource-efficient approach through curating and constructing high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with minimal sample requirements, with a forward-looking design that extends to both pretraining and posttraining phases; (2) enhanced multimodal reasoning capabilities for cross-modal integration and clinical task understanding; and (3) a systematic evaluation system that assesses model performance across medical modalities and task types. Our experiments demonstrate that Infi-Med achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in general medical reasoning while maintaining rapid adaptability to clinical scenarios. The framework establishes a solid foundation for deploying MLLMs in real-world healthcare settings by balancing model effectiveness with operational constraints.

Summary: 
In this study, a new dataset called QuiteAFew comprising 3,096 diverse few-shot tasks is introduced to investigate in-context learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs). The experiments conducted with Llama-3-8B on QuiteAFew demonstrate that the performance of task vectors peaks at an intermediate layer. Furthermore, the effectiveness of task vectors varies significantly depending on the type of task. Complex tasks are found to rely on multiple subtask-specific vectors rather than a single vector, suggesting a distributed representation of task knowledge. This research sheds light on the mechanisms underlying few-shot learning and provides insights into how LLMs adapt to new tasks using limited examples. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks using few examples, with task vectors - specific hidden state activations - hypothesized to encode task information. Existing studies are limited by small-scale benchmarks, restricting comprehensive analysis. We introduce QuiteAFew, a novel dataset of 3,096 diverse few-shot tasks, each with 30 input-output pairs derived from the Alpaca dataset. Experiments with Llama-3-8B on QuiteAFew reveal: (1) task vector performance peaks at an intermediate layer (e.g., 15th), (2) effectiveness varies significantly by task type, and (3) complex tasks rely on multiple, subtask-specific vectors rather than a single vector, suggesting distributed task knowledge representation.

<div> Verbalized confidence, hallucination detection, long-form generation, reinforcement learning, factuality<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces LoVeC, a method for verbalized confidence estimation in long-form generation tasks. Using reinforcement learning, LLMs are trained to append numerical confidence scores to generated statements to indicate factuality. Various RL methods like DPO, ORPO, and GRPO are explored to improve model calibration. Two evaluation settings, free-form tagging, and iterative tagging, are introduced to assess the effectiveness of verbalized confidence estimation. Experiment results on three long-form QA datasets demonstrate that RL-trained models achieve better calibration and generalizability across domains. The method is also efficient, requiring minimal additional tokens in the output being decoded. <div>
arXiv:2505.23912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination remains a major challenge for the safe and trustworthy deployment of large language models (LLMs) in factual content generation. Prior work has explored confidence estimation as an effective approach to hallucination detection, but often relies on post-hoc self-consistency methods that require computationally expensive sampling. Verbalized confidence offers a more efficient alternative, but existing approaches are largely limited to short-form question answering (QA) tasks and do not generalize well to open-ended generation. In this paper, we propose LoVeC (Long-form Verbalized Confidence), an on-the-fly verbalized confidence estimation method for long-form generation. Specifically, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to append numerical confidence scores to each generated statement, serving as a direct and interpretable signal of the factuality of generation. Our experiments consider both on-policy and off-policy RL methods, including DPO, ORPO, and GRPO, to enhance the model calibration. We introduce two novel evaluation settings, free-form tagging and iterative tagging, to assess different verbalized confidence estimation methods. Experiments on three long-form QA datasets show that our RL-trained models achieve better calibration and generalize robustly across domains. Also, our method is highly efficient, as it only requires adding a few tokens to the output being decoded.

arXiv:2505.23914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models are widely used for content moderation but often misclassify benign comments as toxic, leading to over-sensitivity. While previous research attributes this issue primarily to the presence of offensive terms, we reveal a potential cause beyond token level: LLMs exhibit systematic topic biases in their implicit associations. Inspired by cognitive psychology's implicit association tests, we introduce Topic Association Analysis, a semantic-level approach to quantify how LLMs associate certain topics with toxicity. By prompting LLMs to generate free-form scenario imagination for misclassified benign comments and analyzing their topic amplification levels, we find that more advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo) demonstrate stronger topic stereotype despite lower overall false positive rates. These biases suggest that LLMs do not merely react to explicit, offensive language but rely on learned topic associations, shaping their moderation decisions. Our findings highlight the need for refinement beyond keyword-based filtering, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms driving LLM over-sensitivity.

Abstract: Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) aim to simulate characters for realistic and engaging human-computer interactions. However, traditional reward models often struggle with scalability and adapting to subjective conversational preferences. We propose ChARM, a Character-based Act-adaptive Reward Model, addressing these challenges through two innovations: (1) an act-adaptive margin that significantly enhances learning efficiency and generalizability, and (2) a self-evolution mechanism leveraging large-scale unlabeled data to improve training coverage. Additionally, we introduce RoleplayPref, the first large-scale preference dataset specifically for RPLAs, featuring 1,108 characters, 13 subcategories, and 16,888 bilingual dialogues, alongside RoleplayEval, a dedicated evaluation benchmark. Experimental results show a 13% improvement over the conventional Bradley-Terry model in preference rankings. Furthermore, applying ChARM-generated rewards to preference learning techniques (e.g., direct preference optimization) achieves state-of-the-art results on CharacterEval and RoleplayEval. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/calubkk/ChARM.

Abstract: The think-aloud method, where participants voice their thoughts as they solve a task, is a valuable source of rich data about human reasoning processes. Yet, it has declined in popularity in contemporary cognitive science, largely because labor-intensive transcription and annotation preclude large sample sizes. Here, we develop methods to automate the transcription and annotation of verbal reports of reasoning using natural language processing tools, allowing for large-scale analysis of think-aloud data. In our study, 640 participants thought aloud while playing the Game of 24, a mathematical reasoning task. We automatically transcribed the recordings and coded the transcripts as search graphs, finding moderate inter-rater reliability with humans. We analyze these graphs and characterize consistency and variation in human reasoning traces. Our work demonstrates the value of think-aloud data at scale and serves as a proof of concept for the automated analysis of verbal reports.

arXiv:2505.23932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SwingArena, a competitive evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that closely mirrors real-world software development workflows. Unlike traditional static benchmarks, SwingArena models the collaborative process of software iteration by pairing LLMs as submitters, who generate patches, and reviewers, who create test cases and verify the patches through continuous integration (CI) pipelines. To support these interactive evaluations, we introduce a retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) module that efficiently handles long-context challenges by providing syntactically and semantically relevant code snippets from large codebases, supporting multiple programming languages (C++, Python, Rust, and Go). This enables the framework to scale across diverse tasks and contexts while respecting token limitations. Our experiments, using over 400 high-quality real-world GitHub issues selected from a pool of 2,300 issues, show that models like GPT-4o excel at aggressive patch generation, whereas DeepSeek and Gemini prioritize correctness in CI validation. SwingArena presents a scalable and extensible methodology for evaluating LLMs in realistic, CI-driven software development settings.

Abstract: Causality detection and mining are important tasks in information retrieval due to their enormous use in information extraction, and knowledge graph construction. To solve these tasks, in existing literature there exist several solutions -- both unsupervised and supervised. However, the unsupervised methods suffer from poor performance and they often require significant human intervention for causal rule selection, leading to poor generalization across different domains. On the other hand, supervised methods suffer from the lack of large training datasets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) with effective prompt engineering are found to be effective to overcome the issue of unavailability of large training dataset. Yet, in existing literature, there does not exist comprehensive works on causality detection and mining using LLM prompting. In this paper, we present several retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based dynamic prompting schemes to enhance LLM performance in causality detection and extraction tasks. Extensive experiments over three datasets and five LLMs validate the superiority of our proposed RAG-based dynamic prompting over other static prompting schemes.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances performance of large language models, but questions remain about whether these reasoning traces faithfully reflect the internal processes of the model. We present the first comprehensive study of CoT faithfulness in large vision-language models (LVLMs), investigating how both text-based and previously unexplored image-based biases affect reasoning and bias articulation. Our work introduces a novel, fine-grained evaluation pipeline for categorizing bias articulation patterns, enabling significantly more precise analysis of CoT reasoning than previous methods. This framework reveals critical distinctions in how models process and respond to different types of biases, providing new insights into LVLM CoT faithfulness. Our findings reveal that subtle image-based biases are rarely articulated compared to explicit text-based ones, even in models specialized for reasoning. Additionally, many models exhibit a previously unidentified phenomenon we term ``inconsistent'' reasoning - correctly reasoning before abruptly changing answers, serving as a potential canary for detecting biased reasoning from unfaithful CoTs. We then apply the same evaluation pipeline to revisit CoT faithfulness in LLMs across various levels of implicit cues. Our findings reveal that current language-only reasoning models continue to struggle with articulating cues that are not overtly stated.

Although recent low-rank decomposition methods offer a promising path for structural compression, they often suffer from accuracy degradation, expensive calibration procedures, and result in inefficient model architectures that hinder real-world inference speedups. In this paper, we propose FLAT-LLM, a fast and accurate, training-free structural compression method based on fine-grained low-rank transformations in the activation space. Specifically, we reduce the hidden dimension by transforming the weights using truncated eigenvectors computed via head-wise Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employ an importance-based metric to adaptively allocate ranks across decoders. FLAT-LLM achieves efficient and effective weight compression without recovery fine-tuning, which could complete the calibration within a few minutes. Evaluated across 4 models and 11 datasets, FLAT-LLM outperforms structural pruning baselines in generalization and downstream performance, while delivering inference speedups over decomposition-based methods.

<title>Is Your Model Fairly Certain? Uncertainty-Aware Fairness Evaluation for LLMs</title>

Abstract: The recent rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights the critical need for benchmarking their fairness. Conventional fairness metrics, which focus on discrete accuracy-based evaluations (i.e., prediction correctness), fail to capture the implicit impact of model uncertainty (e.g., higher model confidence about one group over another despite similar accuracy). To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fairness metric, UCerF, to enable a fine-grained evaluation of model fairness that is more reflective of the internal bias in model decisions compared to conventional fairness measures. Furthermore, observing data size, diversity, and clarity issues in current datasets, we introduce a new gender-occupation fairness evaluation dataset with 31,756 samples for co-reference resolution, offering a more diverse and suitable dataset for evaluating modern LLMs. We establish a benchmark, using our metric and dataset, and apply it to evaluate the behavior of ten open-source LLMs. For example, Mistral-7B exhibits suboptimal fairness due to high confidence in incorrect predictions, a detail overlooked by Equalized Odds but captured by UCerF. Overall, our proposed LLM benchmark, which evaluates fairness with uncertainty awareness, paves the way for developing more transparent and accountable AI systems.

<title>Diversity of Transformer Layers: One Aspect of Parameter Scaling Laws</title>

Abstract: Transformers deliver outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks and are now a dominant backbone architecture for large language models (LLMs). Their task-solving performance is improved by increasing parameter size, as shown in the recent studies on parameter scaling laws. Although recent mechanistic-interpretability studies have deepened our understanding of the internal behavior of Transformers by analyzing their residual stream, the relationship between these internal mechanisms and the parameter scaling laws remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which mainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first theoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a bias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error of each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which indicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other. Analyzing Transformers under this theory reveals that performance improves when individual layers make predictions close to the correct answer and remain mutually diverse. We show that diversity becomes especially critical when individual layers' outputs are far from the ground truth. Finally, we introduce an information-theoretic diversity and show our main findings that adding layers enhances performance only when those layers behave differently, i.e., are diverse. We also reveal the performance gains from increasing the number of layers exhibit submodularity: marginal improvements diminish as additional layers increase, mirroring the logarithmic convergence predicted by the parameter scaling laws. Experiments on multiple semantic-understanding tasks with various LLMs empirically confirm the theoretical properties derived in this study.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text but struggle to enforce external constraints because they generate tokens sequentially without explicit control mechanisms. GenCP addresses this limitation by combining LLM predictions with Constraint Programming (CP) reasoning, formulating text generation as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In this paper, we improve GenCP by integrating Masked Language Models (MLMs) for domain generation, which allows bidirectional constraint propagation that leverages both past and future tokens. This integration bridges the gap between token-level prediction and structured constraint enforcement, leading to more reliable and constraint-aware text generation. Our evaluation on COLLIE benchmarks demonstrates that incorporating domain preview via MLM calls significantly improves GenCP's performance. Although this approach incurs additional MLM calls and, in some cases, increased backtracking, the overall effect is a more efficient use of LLM inferences and an enhanced ability to generate feasible and meaningful solutions, particularly in tasks with strict content constraints.

Abstract: This paper discusses the construction, fine-tuning, and deployment of BeaverTalk, a cascaded system for speech-to-text translation as part of the IWSLT 2025 simultaneous translation task. The system architecture employs a VAD segmenter for breaking a speech stream into segments, Whisper Large V2 for automatic speech recognition (ASR), and Gemma 3 12B for simultaneous translation. Regarding the simultaneous translation LLM, it is fine-tuned via low-rank adaptors (LoRAs) for a conversational prompting strategy that leverages a single prior-sentence memory bank from the source language as context. The cascaded system participated in the English$\rightarrow$German and English$\rightarrow$Chinese language directions for both the low and high latency regimes. In particular, on the English$\rightarrow$German task, the system achieves a BLEU of 24.64 and 27.83 at a StreamLAAL of 1837.86 and 3343.73, respectively. Then, on the English$\rightarrow$Chinese task, the system achieves a BLEU of 34.07 and 37.23 at a StreamLAAL of 2216.99 and 3521.35, respectively.

arXiv:2505.24033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether hidden states from Structured State Space Models (SSMs) can be merged post-hoc to support downstream reasoning. Inspired by model souping, we propose a strategy where documents are encoded independently and their representations are pooled -- via simple operations like averaging -- into a single context state. This approach, which we call document souping, enables modular encoding and reuse without reprocessing the full input for each query. We finetune Mamba2 models to produce soupable representations and find that they support multi-hop QA, sparse retrieval, and long-document reasoning with strong accuracy. On HotpotQA, souping ten independently encoded documents nearly matches the performance of a cross-encoder trained on the same inputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks, including standardized medical exams. However, correct answers alone do not ensure correct logic, and models may reach accurate conclusions through flawed processes. In this study, we introduce the MedPAIR (Medical Dataset Comparing Physicians and AI Relevance Estimation and Question Answering) dataset to evaluate how physician trainees and LLMs prioritize relevant information when answering QA questions. We obtain annotations on 1,300 QA pairs from 36 physician trainees, labeling each sentence within the question components for relevance. We compare these relevance estimates to those for LLMs, and further evaluate the impact of these "relevant" subsets on downstream task performance for both physician trainees and LLMs. We find that LLMs are frequently not aligned with the content relevance estimates of physician trainees. After filtering out physician trainee-labeled irrelevant sentences, accuracy improves for both the trainees and the LLMs. All LLM and physician trainee-labeled data are available at: http://medpair.csail.mit.edu/.

<title>TCM-Ladder: A Benchmark for Multimodal Question Answering on Traditional Chinese Medicine</title>

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), as an effective alternative medicine, has been receiving increasing attention. In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) tailored for TCM has underscored the need for an objective and comprehensive evaluation framework to assess their performance on real-world tasks. However, existing evaluation datasets are limited in scope and primarily text-based, lacking a unified and standardized multimodal question-answering (QA) benchmark. To address this issue, we introduce TCM-Ladder, the first multimodal QA dataset specifically designed for evaluating large TCM language models. The dataset spans multiple core disciplines of TCM, including fundamental theory, diagnostics, herbal formulas, internal medicine, surgery, pharmacognosy, and pediatrics. In addition to textual content, TCM-Ladder incorporates various modalities such as images and videos. The datasets were constructed using a combination of automated and manual filtering processes and comprise 52,000+ questions in total. These questions include single-choice, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, diagnostic dialogue, and visual comprehension tasks. We trained a reasoning model on TCM-Ladder and conducted comparative experiments against 9 state-of-the-art general domain and 5 leading TCM-specific LLMs to evaluate their performance on the datasets. Moreover, we propose Ladder-Score, an evaluation method specifically designed for TCM question answering that effectively assesses answer quality regarding terminology usage and semantic expression. To our knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate mainstream general domain and TCM-specific LLMs on a unified multimodal benchmark. The datasets and leaderboard are publicly available at https://tcmladder.com or https://54.211.107.106 and will be continuously updated.

Abstract: Verifiers play a crucial role in large language model (LLM) reasoning, needed by post-training techniques such as reinforcement learning. However, reliable verifiers are hard to get for difficult coding problems, because a well-disguised wrong solution may only be detected by carefully human-written edge cases that are difficult to synthesize. To address this issue, we propose HARDTESTGEN, a pipeline for high-quality test synthesis using LLMs. With this pipeline, we curate a comprehensive competitive programming dataset HARDTESTS with 47k problems and synthetic high-quality tests. Compared with existing tests, HARDTESTGEN tests demonstrate precision that is 11.3 percentage points higher and recall that is 17.5 percentage points higher when evaluating LLM-generated code. For harder problems, the improvement in precision can be as large as 40 points. HARDTESTS also proves to be more effective for model training, measured by downstream code generation performance. We will open-source our dataset and synthesis pipeline at https://leililab.github.io/HardTests/.

Abstract: We present EHRMIND, a practical recipe for adapting large language models (LLMs) to complex clinical reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). While RLVR has succeeded in mathematics and coding, its application to healthcare contexts presents unique challenges due to the specialized knowledge and reasoning required for electronic health record (EHR) interpretation. Our pilot study on the MEDCALC benchmark reveals two key failure modes: (1) misapplied knowledge, where models possess relevant medical knowledge but apply it incorrectly, and (2) missing knowledge, where models lack essential domain knowledge. To address these cases, EHRMIND applies a two-stage solution: a lightweight supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up that injects missing domain knowledge, stabilizes subsequent training, and encourages structured, interpretable outputs; followed by RLVR, which reinforces outcome correctness and refines the model's decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across diverse clinical applications, including medical calculations (MEDCALC), patient-trial matching (TREC CLINICAL TRIALS), and disease diagnosis (EHRSHOT). EHRMIND delivers consistent gains in accuracy, interpretability, and cross-task generalization. These findings offer practical guidance for applying RLVR to enhance LLM capabilities in healthcare settings.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the linguistic diversity of LLM safety research, highlighting the English-centric nature of the field. Through a systematic review of nearly 300 publications from 2020--2024 across major NLP conferences and workshops at *ACL, we identify a significant and growing language gap in LLM safety research, with even high-resource non-English languages receiving minimal attention. We further observe that non-English languages are rarely studied as a standalone language and that English safety research exhibits poor language documentation practice. To motivate future research into multilingual safety, we make several recommendations based on our survey, and we then pose three concrete future directions on safety evaluation, training data generation, and crosslingual safety generalization. Based on our survey and proposed directions, the field can develop more robust, inclusive AI safety practices for diverse global populations.

<title>R-KV: Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Training-Free Reasoning Models Acceleration</title>

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance in self-reflection and chain-of-thought reasoning. However, they often produce excessively long outputs, leading to prohibitively large key-value (KV) caches during inference. While chain-of-thought inference significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks, it can also lead to reasoning failures when deployed with existing KV cache compression approaches. To address this, we propose Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning models (R-KV), a novel method specifically targeting redundant tokens in reasoning models. Our method preserves nearly 100% of the full KV cache performance using only 10% of the KV cache, substantially outperforming existing KV cache baselines, which reach only 60% of the performance. Remarkably, R-KV even achieves 105% of full KV cache performance with 16% of the KV cache. This KV-cache reduction also leads to a 90% memory saving and a 6.6X throughput over standard chain-of-thought reasoning inference. Experimental results show that R-KV consistently outperforms existing KV cache compression baselines across two mathematical reasoning datasets.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) with demonstrations. However, obtaining these demonstrations primarily relies on manual effort. In most real-world scenarios, users are often unwilling or unable to provide such demonstrations. Inspired by the human analogy, we explore a new ICL paradigm CrossICL to study how to utilize existing source task demonstrations in the ICL for target tasks, thereby obtaining reliable guidance without any additional manual effort. To explore this, we first design a two-stage alignment strategy to mitigate the interference caused by gaps across tasks, as the foundation for our experimental exploration. Based on it, we conduct comprehensive exploration of CrossICL, with 875 NLP tasks from the Super-NI benchmark and six types of LLMs, including GPT-4o. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossICL and provide valuable insights on questions like the criteria for selecting cross-task demonstrations, as well as the types of task-gap-induced interference in CrossICL.

Abstract: Training language models with rationales augmentation has been shown to be beneficial in many existing works. In this paper, we identify that such a prevailing view does not hold consistently. We conduct comprehensive investigations to thoroughly inspect the impact of rationales on model performance as well as a novel perspective of model reliability. The results lead to several key findings that add new insights upon existing understandings: 1) Rationales can, at times, deteriorate model performance; 2) Rationales can, at times, improve model reliability, even outperforming their untrained counterparts; 3) A linear correspondence exists in between the performance and reliability improvements, while both are driven by the intrinsic difficulty of the task. These findings provide informative regulations on the broad utilization of rationales and raise critical implications on the procedure of explicitly aligning language models with implicit human thoughts. Codes can be found at https://github.com/Ignoramus0817/rationales.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) structure real-world entities and their relationships into triples, enhancing machine reasoning for various tasks. While domain-specific KGs offer substantial benefits, their manual construction is often inefficient and requires specialized knowledge. Recent approaches for knowledge graph construction (KGC) based on large language models (LLMs), such as schema-guided KGC and reference knowledge integration, have proven efficient. However, these methods are constrained by their reliance on manually defined schema, single-document processing, and public-domain references, making them less effective for domain-specific corpora that exhibit complex knowledge dependencies and specificity, as well as limited reference knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose LKD-KGC, a novel framework for unsupervised domain-specific KG construction. LKD-KGC autonomously analyzes document repositories to infer knowledge dependencies, determines optimal processing sequences via LLM driven prioritization, and autoregressively generates entity schema by integrating hierarchical inter-document contexts. This schema guides the unsupervised extraction of entities and relationships, eliminating reliance on predefined structures or external knowledge. Extensive experiments show that compared with state-of-the-art baselines, LKD-KGC generally achieves improvements of 10% to 20% in both precision and recall rate, demonstrating its potential in constructing high-quality domain-specific KGs.

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Although recent efforts leverage group relative policy optimization (GRPO) for MLLMs post-training, they constantly explore one specific aspect, such as grounding tasks, math problems, or chart analysis. There are no works that can leverage multi-source MLLM tasks for stable reinforcement learning. In this work, we present a unified perspective to solve this problem. We present Mixed-R1, a unified yet straightforward framework that contains a mixed reward function design (Mixed-Reward) and a mixed post-training dataset (Mixed-45K). We first design a data engine to select high-quality examples to build the Mixed-45K post-training dataset. Then, we present a Mixed-Reward design, which contains various reward functions for various MLLM tasks. In particular, it has four different reward functions: matching reward for binary answer or multiple-choice problems, chart reward for chart-aware datasets, IoU reward for grounding problems, and open-ended reward for long-form text responses such as caption datasets. To handle the various long-form text content, we propose a new open-ended reward named Bidirectional Max-Average Similarity (BMAS) by leveraging tokenizer embedding matching between the generated response and the ground truth. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method on various MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL and Intern-VL on various sizes. Our dataset and model are available at https://github.com/xushilin1/mixed-r1.

Abstract: Evol-Instruct has made significant improvements as a data synthesis method in several areas. Existing methods typically rely on a fixed set of strategies to evolve, which require manual design and are monolithic in form. In addition, iterative evolution also makes the acquisition of hard samples expensive. In view of this, we propose the Tag-Evol framework, a more diverse and efficient instruction evolving method. Specifically, Tag-Evol uses diverse and specific knowledge tags as strategies to achieve controlled evolution by injecting different combinations of tags into the original instructions. Experiments with multiple backbones in diverse domain benchmarks show that the proposed method generates significantly better evolved data than other methods. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough analysis of the evolved data, demonstrating that Tag-Evol is not only efficient but also generates more diverse and challenging data.

Abstract: This study proposes a simple yet effective LoRA merge method to achieve LLM adaptation for low-resource language generation tasks. The LoRA merge technique, which integrates multiple LoRA modules trained on different tasks, has gained attention as an effective and efficient approach for adapting LLMs to target tasks. However, previous methods are limited in adaptability as they keep the LoRA parameters frozen. Additionally, the low-resource problem has been out of their scope. We propose a LoRA merge method that updates and prunes LoRA parameters through fine-tuning with minimal target task data, which allows finer-grained adjustments of LoRA parameters and enhancement of task adaptability. Extensive experiments have been conducted taking summarization as a benchmark task. Our datasets cover various domains and multiple languages of English and Japanese. The results confirm that the proposed method achieves significant and consistent improvements in task adaptability over the previous methods.

Abstract: The prevailing assumption of an exponential decay in large language model (LLM) reliability with sequence length, predicated on independent per-token error probabilities, posits an inherent limitation for long autoregressive outputs. Our research fundamentally challenges this view by synthesizing emerging evidence that LLM errors are not uniformly distributed but are concentrated at sparse "key tokens" ($5-10\%$ of total tokens) representing critical decision junctions. By distinguishing these high-impact tokens from the increasingly predictable majority, we introduce a new reliability formula explaining the sustained coherence of modern LLMs over thousands of tokens. Converging research streams reveal that long-context performance primarily depends on accurately navigating a few crucial semantic decision points rather than on uniform token-level accuracy, enabling targeted strategies that significantly outperform brute-force approaches. We thus propose a framework for next-generation systems centered on selective preservation of semantically vital tokens, dynamic computational allocation at uncertain decision boundaries, multi-path exploration at ambiguities, and architectures aligned with natural semantic domains. This marks a fundamental shift from raw scaling to strategic reasoning, promising breakthrough performance without proportionate computational scaling and offering a more nuanced understanding that supersedes the exponential decay hypothesis, thereby opening pathways toward substantially more powerful and efficient language systems.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a promising method for accelerating the decoding process of Large Language Models (LLMs). The efficiency of SD primarily hinges on the consistency between the draft model and the verify model. However, existing drafting approaches typically require additional modules to be trained, which can be challenging to implement and ensure compatibility across various LLMs. In this paper, we propose CLaSp, an in-context layer-skipping strategy for self-speculative decoding. Unlike prior methods, CLaSp does not require additional drafting modules or extra training. Instead, it employs a plug-and-play mechanism by skipping intermediate layers of the verify model to construct a compressed draft model. Specifically, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging the complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective. This enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each verification stage, without relying on pre-optimized sets of skipped layers. Experimental results across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that CLaSp achieves a speedup of 1.3x ~ 1.7x on LLaMA3 series models without altering the original distribution of the generated text.

<title>Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets for Large Language Model Data Annotation: A Novel Approach to Side-by-Side Preference Labeling</title>

Abstract: The quality of human preference data is crucial for training and evaluating large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) scenarios. Traditional side-by-side (SBS) annotation approaches often struggle with inherent uncertainty, annotator disagreement, and the complexity of preference judgments. This paper introduces a novel framework based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS) for modeling and aggregating human preferences in LLM data annotation tasks. Our approach captures not only the degree of preference but also the uncertainty and hesitation inherent in human judgment through membership, non-membership, and hesitation degrees. We propose an IFS-based annotation protocol that enables more nuanced preference modeling, develops aggregation methods for handling annotator disagreement, and introduces quality metrics for preference data assessment. Experimental validation on multiple datasets demonstrates that our IFS-based approach significantly improves annotation consistency, reduces annotator fatigue, and produces higher-quality preference data compared to traditional binary and Likert-scale methods. The resulting preference datasets lead to improved model performance in downstream tasks, with 12.3\% improvement in win-rate against baseline models and 15.7\% reduction in annotation time. Our framework provides a principled approach to handling uncertainty in human preference annotation and offers practical benefits for large-scale LLM training.

<title>Are Any-to-Any Models More Consistent Across Modality Transfers Than Specialists?</title>

Abstract: Any-to-any generative models aim to enable seamless interpretation and generation across multiple modalities within a unified framework, yet their ability to preserve relationships across modalities remains uncertain. Do unified models truly achieve cross-modal coherence, or is this coherence merely perceived? To explore this, we introduce ACON, a dataset of 1,000 images (500 newly contributed) paired with captions, editing instructions, and Q&amp;A pairs to evaluate cross-modal transfers rigorously. Using three consistency criteria-cyclic consistency, forward equivariance, and conjugated equivariance-our experiments reveal that any-to-any models do not consistently demonstrate greater cross-modal consistency than specialized models in pointwise evaluations such as cyclic consistency. However, equivariance evaluations uncover weak but observable consistency through structured analyses of the intermediate latent space enabled by multiple editing operations. We release our code and data at https://github.com/JiwanChung/ACON.

<title>Semi-structured LLM Reasoners Can Be Rigorously Audited</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly capable at reasoning, the problem of "faithfulness" persists: LLM "reasoning traces" can contain errors and omissions that are difficult to detect, and may obscure biases in model outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Semi-Structured Reasoning Models (SSRMs), which internalize a semi-structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning format within the model. Our SSRMs generate reasoning traces in a Pythonic syntax. While SSRM traces are not executable, they adopt a restricted, task-specific vocabulary to name distinct reasoning steps, and to mark each step's inputs and outputs. Through extensive evaluation on ten benchmarks, SSRMs demonstrate strong performance and generality: they outperform comparably sized baselines by nearly ten percentage points on in-domain tasks while remaining competitive with specialized models on out-of-domain medical benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that semi-structured reasoning is more amenable to analysis: in particular, they can be automatically audited to identify reasoning flaws. We explore both hand-crafted structured audits, which detect task-specific problematic reasoning patterns, and learned typicality audits, which apply probabilistic models over reasoning patterns, and show that both audits can be used to effectively flag probable reasoning errors.

<title>ERU-KG: Efficient Reference-aligned Unsupervised Keyphrase Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24219</link>

Abstract: Unsupervised keyphrase prediction has gained growing interest in recent years. However, existing methods typically rely on heuristically defined importance scores, which may lead to inaccurate informativeness estimation. In addition, they lack consideration for time efficiency. To solve these problems, we propose ERU-KG, an unsupervised keyphrase generation (UKG) model that consists of an informativeness and a phraseness module. The former estimates the relevance of keyphrase candidates, while the latter generate those candidates. The informativeness module innovates by learning to model informativeness through references (e.g., queries, citation contexts, and titles) and at the term-level, thereby 1) capturing how the key concepts of documents are perceived in different contexts and 2) estimating informativeness of phrases more efficiently by aggregating term informativeness, removing the need for explicit modeling of the candidates. ERU-KG demonstrates its effectiveness on keyphrase generation benchmarks by outperforming unsupervised baselines and achieving on average 89\% of the performance of a supervised model for top 10 predictions. Additionally, to highlight its practical utility, we evaluate the model on text retrieval tasks and show that keyphrases generated by ERU-KG are effective when employed as query and document expansions. Furthermore, inference speed tests reveal that ERU-KG is the fastest among baselines of similar model sizes. Finally, our proposed model can switch between keyphrase generation and extraction by adjusting hyperparameters, catering to diverse application requirements.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation from chest X-ray (CXR) images has the potential to improve clinical efficiency and reduce radiologists' workload. However, most datasets, including the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus, consist entirely of free-form reports, which are inherently variable and unstructured. This variability poses challenges for both generation and evaluation: existing models struggle to produce consistent, clinically meaningful reports, and standard evaluation metrics fail to capture the nuances of radiological interpretation. To address this, we introduce Structured Radiology Report Generation (SRRG), a new task that reformulates free-text radiology reports into a standardized format, ensuring clarity, consistency, and structured clinical reporting. We create a novel dataset by restructuring reports using large language models (LLMs) following strict structured reporting desiderata. Additionally, we introduce SRR-BERT, a fine-grained disease classification model trained on 55 labels, enabling more precise and clinically informed evaluation of structured reports. To assess report quality, we propose F1-SRR-BERT, a metric that leverages SRR-BERT's hierarchical disease taxonomy to bridge the gap between free-text variability and structured clinical reporting. We validate our dataset through a reader study conducted by five board-certified radiologists and extensive benchmarking experiments.

<title>Dynamic Context-Aware Streaming Pretrained Language Model For Inverse Text Normalization</title>

Abstract: Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) is crucial for converting spoken Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs into well-formatted written text, enhancing both readability and usability. Despite its importance, the integration of streaming ITN within streaming ASR remains largely unexplored due to challenges in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, particularly in low-resource and limited-context scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a streaming pretrained language model for ITN, leveraging pretrained linguistic representations for improved robustness. To address streaming constraints, we propose Dynamic Context-Aware during training and inference, enabling adaptive chunk size adjustments and the integration of right-context information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to non-streaming ITN and surpasses existing streaming ITN models on a Vietnamese dataset, all while maintaining low latency, ensuring seamless integration into ASR systems.

<title>Advantageous Parameter Expansion Training Makes Better Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Although scaling up the number of trainable parameters in both pre-training and fine-tuning can effectively improve the performance of large language models, it also leads to increased computational overhead. When delving into the parameter difference, we find that a subset of parameters, termed advantageous parameters, plays a crucial role in determining model performance. Further analysis reveals that stronger models tend to possess more such parameters. In this paper, we propose Advantageous Parameter EXpansion Training (APEX), a method that progressively expands advantageous parameters into the space of disadvantageous ones, thereby increasing their proportion and enhancing training effectiveness. Further theoretical analysis from the perspective of matrix effective rank explains the performance gains of APEX. Extensive experiments on both instruction tuning and continued pre-training demonstrate that, in instruction tuning, APEX outperforms full-parameter tuning while using only 52% of the trainable parameters. In continued pre-training, APEX achieves the same perplexity level as conventional training with just 33% of the training data, and yields significant improvements on downstream tasks.

<title>Mamba Knockout for Unraveling Factual Information Flow</title>

arXiv:2505.24244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the flow of factual information in Mamba State-Space Model (SSM)-based language models. We rely on theoretical and empirical connections to Transformer-based architectures and their attention mechanisms. Exploiting this relationship, we adapt attentional interpretability techniques originally developed for Transformers--specifically, the Attention Knockout methodology--to both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2. Using them we trace how information is transmitted and localized across tokens and layers, revealing patterns of subject-token information emergence and layer-wise dynamics. Notably, some phenomena vary between mamba models and Transformer based models, while others appear universally across all models inspected--hinting that these may be inherent to LLMs in general. By further leveraging Mamba's structured factorization, we disentangle how distinct "features" either enable token-to-token information exchange or enrich individual tokens, thus offering a unified lens to understand Mamba internal operations.

<title>Proactive Guidance of Multi-Turn Conversation in Industrial Search</title>

arXiv:2505.24251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced multi-turn conversation systems, emphasizing the need for proactive guidance to enhance users' interactions. However, these systems face challenges in dynamically adapting to shifts in users' goals and maintaining low latency for real-time interactions. In the Baidu Search AI assistant, an industrial-scale multi-turn search system, we propose a novel two-phase framework to provide proactive guidance. The first phase, Goal-adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (G-SFT), employs a goal adaptation agent that dynamically adapts to user goal shifts and provides goal-relevant contextual information. G-SFT also incorporates scalable knowledge transfer to distill insights from LLMs into a lightweight model for real-time interaction. The second phase, Click-oriented Reinforcement Learning (C-RL), adopts a generate-rank paradigm, systematically constructs preference pairs from user click signals, and proactively improves click-through rates through more engaging guidance. This dual-phase architecture achieves complementary objectives: G-SFT ensures accurate goal tracking, while C-RL optimizes interaction quality through click signal-driven reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves 86.10% accuracy in offline evaluation (+23.95% over baseline) and 25.28% CTR in online deployment (149.06% relative improvement), while reducing inference latency by 69.55% through scalable knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in simulating human behaviors and performing theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning, a crucial skill for complex social interactions. In this study, we investigate the role of ToM reasoning in aligning agentic behaviors with human norms in negotiation tasks, using the ultimatum game as a controlled environment. We initialized LLM agents with different prosocial beliefs (including Greedy, Fair, and Selfless) and reasoning methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) and varying ToM levels, and examined their decision-making processes across diverse LLMs, including reasoning models like o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Qwen 32B. Results from 2,700 simulations indicated that ToM reasoning enhances behavior alignment, decision-making consistency, and negotiation outcomes. Consistent with previous findings, reasoning models exhibit limited capability compared to models with ToM reasoning, different roles of the game benefits with different orders of ToM reasoning. Our findings contribute to the understanding of ToM's role in enhancing human-AI interaction and cooperative decision-making. The code used for our experiments can be found at https://github.com/Stealth-py/UltimatumToM.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to improve, as reflected in rising scores on standard benchmarks. However, the lack of transparency around training data raises concerns about potential overlap with evaluation sets and the fairness of reported results. Although prior work has proposed methods for detecting data leakage, these approaches primarily focus on identifying outliers and have not been evaluated under controlled simulated leakage conditions. In this work, we compare existing leakage detection techniques, namely permutation and n-gram-based methods, under a continual pretraining setup that simulates real-world leakage scenarios, and additionally explore a lightweight method we call semi-half question. Although semi-half offers a low-cost alternative, our analysis shows that the n-gram method consistently achieves the highest F1-score. We also refine these techniques to support instance-level detection and reduce computational overhead. Leveraging the best-performing method, we create cleaned versions of MMLU and HellaSwag, and re-evaluate several LLMs. Our findings present a practical path toward more reliable and transparent evaluations, and we recommend contamination checks as a standard step before releasing benchmark results.

<title>Faithful and Robust LLM-Driven Theorem Proving for NLI Explanations</title>

Abstract: Natural language explanations play a fundamental role in Natural Language Inference (NLI) by revealing how premises logically entail hypotheses. Recent work has shown that the interaction of large language models (LLMs) with theorem provers (TPs) can help verify and improve the validity of NLI explanations. However, TPs require translating natural language into machine-verifiable formal representations, a process that introduces the risk of semantic information loss and unfaithful interpretation, an issue compounded by LLMs' challenges in capturing critical logical structures with sufficient precision. Moreover, LLMs are still limited in their capacity for rigorous and robust proof construction within formal verification frameworks. To mitigate issues related to faithfulness and robustness, this paper investigates strategies to (1) alleviate semantic loss during autoformalisation, (2) efficiently identify and correct syntactic errors in logical representations, (3) explicitly use logical expressions to guide LLMs in generating structured proof sketches, and (4) increase LLMs' capacity of interpreting TP's feedback for iterative refinement. Our empirical results on e-SNLI, QASC and WorldTree using different LLMs demonstrate that the proposed strategies yield significant improvements in autoformalisation (+18.46%, +34.2%, +39.77%) and explanation refinement (+29.5%, +51.5%, +41.25%) over the state-of-the-art model. Moreover, we show that specific interventions on the hybrid LLM-TP architecture can substantially improve efficiency, drastically reducing the number of iterations required for successful verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support scientific research, but their knowledge of scientific advancements can quickly become outdated. We introduce ScienceMeter, a new framework for evaluating scientific knowledge update methods over scientific knowledge spanning the past, present, and future. ScienceMeter defines three metrics: knowledge preservation, the extent to which models' understanding of previously learned papers are preserved; knowledge acquisition, how well scientific claims from newly introduced papers are acquired; and knowledge projection, the ability of the updated model to anticipate or generalize to related scientific claims that may emerge in the future. Using ScienceMeter, we examine the scientific knowledge of LLMs on claim judgment and generation tasks across a curated dataset of 15,444 scientific papers and 30,888 scientific claims from ten domains including medicine, biology, materials science, and computer science. We evaluate five representative knowledge update approaches including training- and inference-time methods. With extensive experiments, we find that the best-performing knowledge update methods can preserve only 85.9% of existing knowledge, acquire 71.7% of new knowledge, and project 37.7% of future knowledge. Inference-based methods work for larger models, whereas smaller models require training to achieve comparable performance. Cross-domain analysis reveals that performance on these objectives is correlated. Even when applying on specialized scientific LLMs, existing knowledge update methods fail to achieve these objectives collectively, underscoring that developing robust scientific knowledge update mechanisms is both crucial and challenging.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, when handling long-form text modification tasks, they still face two major problems: (1) producing undesired modifications by inappropriately altering or summarizing irrelevant content, and (2) missing necessary modifications to implicitly related passages that are crucial for maintaining document coherence. To address these issues, we propose HiCaM, a Hierarchical-Causal Modification framework that operates through a hierarchical summary tree and a causal graph. Furthermore, to evaluate HiCaM, we derive a multi-domain dataset from various benchmarks, providing a resource for assessing its effectiveness. Comprehensive evaluations on the dataset demonstrate significant improvements over strong LLMs, with our method achieving up to a 79.50\% win rate. These results highlight the comprehensiveness of our approach, showing consistent performance improvements across multiple models and domains.

Abstract: User sentiment on social media reveals the underlying social trends, crises, and needs. Researchers have analyzed users' past messages to trace the evolution of sentiments and reconstruct sentiment dynamics. However, predicting the imminent sentiment of an ongoing event is rarely studied. In this paper, we address the problem of \textbf{sentiment forecasting} on social media to predict the user's future sentiment in response to the development of the event. We extract sentiment-related features to enhance the modeling skill and propose a multi-perspective role-playing framework to simulate the process of human response. Our preliminary results show significant improvement in sentiment forecasting on both microscopic and macroscopic levels.

Abstract: Information seeking demands iterative evidence gathering and reflective reasoning, yet large language models (LLMs) still struggle with it in open-web question answering. Existing methods rely on static prompting rules or training with Wikipedia-based corpora and retrieval environments, limiting adaptability to the real-world web environment where ambiguity, conflicting evidence, and noise are prevalent. These constrained training settings hinder LLMs from learning to dynamically decide when and where to search, and how to adjust search depth and frequency based on informational demands. We define this missing capacity as Search Intensity Scaling (SIS)--the emergent skill to intensify search efforts under ambiguous or conflicting conditions, rather than settling on overconfident, under-verification answers.
  To study SIS, we introduce WebPuzzle, the first dataset designed to foster information-seeking behavior in open-world internet environments. WebPuzzle consists of 24K training instances and 275 test questions spanning both wiki-based and open-web queries. Building on this dataset, we propose DeepDiver, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that promotes SIS by encouraging adaptive search policies through exploration under a real-world open-web environment. Experimental results show that Pangu-7B-Reasoner empowered by DeepDiver achieve performance on real-web tasks comparable to the 671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1. We detail DeepDiver's training curriculum from cold-start supervised fine-tuning to a carefully designed RL phase, and present that its capability of SIS generalizes from closed-form QA to open-ended tasks such as long-form writing. Our contributions advance adaptive information seeking in LLMs and provide a valuable benchmark and dataset for future research.

Abstract: Detecting toxic content using language models is important but challenging. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in understanding Chinese, recent studies show that simple character substitutions in toxic Chinese text can easily confuse the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. In this paper, we highlight the multimodal nature of Chinese language as a key challenge for deploying LLMs in toxic Chinese detection. First, we propose a taxonomy of 3 perturbation strategies and 8 specific approaches in toxic Chinese content. Then, we curate a dataset based on this taxonomy, and benchmark 9 SOTA LLMs (from both the US and China) to assess if they can detect perturbed toxic Chinese text. Additionally, we explore cost-effective enhancement solutions like in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our results reveal two important findings. (1) LLMs are less capable of detecting perturbed multimodal Chinese toxic contents. (2) ICL or SFT with a small number of perturbed examples may cause the LLMs "overcorrect'': misidentify many normal Chinese contents as toxic.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction aims to correct recognition errors while preserving accurate text. Although traditional approaches demonstrate moderate effectiveness, LLMs offer a paradigm that eliminates the need for training and labeled data. However, directly using LLMs will encounter hallucinations problem, which may lead to the modification of the correct text. To address this problem, we propose the Reliable LLM Correction Framework (RLLM-CF), which consists of three stages: (1) error pre-detection, (2) chain-of-thought sub-tasks iterative correction, and (3) reasoning process verification. The advantage of our method is that it does not require additional information or fine-tuning of the model, and ensures the correctness of the LLM correction under multi-pass programming. Experiments on AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, and Librispeech show that the GPT-4o model enhanced by our framework achieves 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% relative reductions in CER/WER.

Abstract: Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding, reasoning, and executing complex tasks. However, developing robust agents presents significant challenges: substantial engineering overhead, lack of standardized components, and insufficient evaluation frameworks for fair comparison. We introduce Agent Graph-based Orchestration for Reasoning and Assessment (AGORA), a flexible and extensible framework that addresses these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a modular architecture with a graph-based workflow engine, efficient memory management, and clean component abstraction; (2) a comprehensive suite of reusable agent algorithms implementing state-of-the-art reasoning approaches; and (3) a rigorous evaluation framework enabling systematic comparison across multiple dimensions. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and multimodal tasks, we evaluate various agent algorithms across different LLMs, revealing important insights about their relative strengths and applicability. Our results demonstrate that while sophisticated reasoning approaches can enhance agent capabilities, simpler methods like Chain-of-Thought often exhibit robust performance with significantly lower computational overhead. AGORA not only simplifies language agent development but also establishes a foundation for reproducible agent research through standardized evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language (SL) videos into spoken language text, thereby bridging the communication gap between the sign and the spoken community. While most existing works focus on translating a single sign language into a single spoken language (one-to-one SLT), leveraging multilingual resources could mitigate low-resource issues and enhance accessibility. However, multilingual SLT (MLSLT) remains unexplored due to language conflicts and alignment difficulties across SLs and spoken languages. To address these challenges, we propose a multilingual gloss-free model with dual CTC objectives for token-level SL identification and spoken text generation. Our model supports 10 SLs and handles one-to-one, many-to-one, and many-to-many SLT tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on three widely adopted benchmarks: multilingual SP-10, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily.

<title>Knowing Before Saying: LLM Representations Encode Information About Chain-of-Thought Success Before Completion</title>

Abstract: We investigate whether the success of a zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process can be predicted before completion. We discover that a probing classifier, based on LLM representations, performs well \emph{even before a single token is generated}, suggesting that crucial information about the reasoning process is already present in the initial steps representations. In contrast, a strong BERT-based baseline, which relies solely on the generated tokens, performs worse, likely because it depends on shallow linguistic cues rather than deeper reasoning dynamics. Surprisingly, using later reasoning steps does not always improve classification. When additional context is unhelpful, earlier representations resemble later ones more, suggesting LLMs encode key information early. This implies reasoning can often stop early without loss. To test this, we conduct early stopping experiments, showing that truncating CoT reasoning still improves performance over not using CoT at all, though a gap remains compared to full reasoning. However, approaches like supervised learning or reinforcement learning designed to shorten CoT chains could leverage our classifier's guidance to identify when early stopping is effective. Our findings provide insights that may support such methods, helping to optimize CoT's efficiency while preserving its benefits.\footnote{Code and data is available at \href{https://github.com/anum94/CoTpred}{\texttt{github.com/anum94/CoTpred}}.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced natural-language reasoning. However, their limited parametric memory and susceptibility to hallucination present persistent challenges for tasks requiring accurate, context-based inference. To overcome these limitations, an increasing number of studies have proposed leveraging external knowledge to enhance LLMs. This study offers a systematic exploration of strategies for using external knowledge to enhance LLMs, beginning with a taxonomy that categorizes external knowledge into unstructured and structured data. We then focus on structured knowledge, presenting distinct taxonomies for tables and knowledge graphs (KGs), detailing their integration paradigms with LLMs, and reviewing representative methods. Our comparative analysis further highlights the trade-offs among interpretability, scalability, and performance, providing insights for developing trustworthy and generalizable knowledge-enhanced LLMs.

<title>ClueAnchor: Clue-Anchored Knowledge Reasoning Exploration and Optimization for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge to improve factuality. However, existing RAG systems frequently underutilize the retrieved documents, failing to extract and integrate the key clues needed to support faithful and interpretable reasoning, especially in cases where relevant evidence is implicit, scattered, or obscured by noise. To address this issue, we propose ClueAnchor, a novel framework for enhancing RAG via clue-anchored reasoning exploration and optimization. ClueAnchor extracts key clues from retrieved content and generates multiple reasoning paths based on different knowledge configurations, optimizing the model by selecting the most effective one through reward-based preference optimization. Experiments show that ClueAnchor significantly outperforms prior RAG baselines in reasoning completeness and robustness. Further analysis confirms its strong resilience to noisy or partially relevant retrieved content, as well as its capability to identify supporting evidence even in the absence of explicit clue supervision during inference.

<title>LLMs Are Globally Multilingual Yet Locally Monolingual: Exploring Knowledge Transfer via Language and Thought Theory</title>

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) open up new possibilities for leveraging information across languages, but their factual knowledge recall remains inconsistent depending on the input language. While previous studies have attempted to address this issue through English-based prompting and evaluation, we explore non-English to English transfer via Language and Thought Theory. This perspective allows us to examine language-thought binding in LLMs and uncover why factual knowledge often fails to transfer effectively. We propose the Language-to-Thought (L2T) prompting strategy, which analyzes the relationship between input language, internal cognitive processes, and knowledge. Experimental results challenge the assumption that English-based approaches consistently outperform other languages and offer a novel insight that aligning the model's internal thought with the knowledge required for the task is critical for successful cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, we show that applying L2T during training can alleviate LLMs' reliance on the input language and facilitate cross-linguistic knowledge integration without translation-based learning. Code and datasets will be available.

Abstract: Large language models and vision-language models (which we jointly call LMs) have transformed NLP and CV, demonstrating remarkable potential across various fields. However, their capabilities in affective analysis (i.e. sentiment analysis and emotion detection) remain underexplored. This gap is largely due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, and the inherent complexity of affective analysis tasks. In this paper, we introduce MMAFFBen, the first extensive open-source benchmark for multilingual multimodal affective analysis. MMAFFBen encompasses text, image, and video modalities across 35 languages, covering four key affective analysis tasks: sentiment polarity, sentiment intensity, emotion classification, and emotion intensity. Moreover, we construct the MMAFFIn dataset for fine-tuning LMs on affective analysis tasks, and further develop MMAFFLM-3b and MMAFFLM-7b based on it. We evaluate various representative LMs, including GPT-4o-mini, providing a systematic comparison of their affective understanding capabilities. This project is available at https://github.com/lzw108/MMAFFBen.

<title>Donate or Create? Comparing Data Collection Strategies for Emotion-labeled Multimodal Social Media Posts</title>

Abstract: Accurate modeling of subjective phenomena such as emotion expression requires data annotated with authors' intentions. Commonly such data is collected by asking study participants to donate and label genuine content produced in the real world, or create content fitting particular labels during the study. Asking participants to create content is often simpler to implement and presents fewer risks to participant privacy than data donation. However, it is unclear if and how study-created content may differ from genuine content, and how differences may impact models. We collect study-created and genuine multimodal social media posts labeled for emotion and compare them on several dimensions, including model performance. We find that compared to genuine posts, study-created posts are longer, rely more on their text and less on their images for emotion expression, and focus more on emotion-prototypical events. The samples of participants willing to donate versus create posts are demographically different. Study-created data is valuable to train models that generalize well to genuine data, but realistic effectiveness estimates require genuine data.

<title>Model Unlearning via Sparse Autoencoder Subspace Guided Projections</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of information, making them powerful yet raising privacy and safety concerns when selective knowledge removal is required. Existing unlearning strategies, ranging from gradient-based fine-tuning and model editing to sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering, either lack interpretability or fail to provide a robust defense against adversarial prompts. We propose SAE-Guided Subspace Projection Unlearning (SSPU), a novel framework that leverages SAE features to drive targeted updates in the model's parameter space, enabling precise, interpretable, and robust unlearning. SSPU's three-stage pipeline performs data-driven layer and feature selection, subspace construction via QR decomposition, and constrained optimization that controls activations into an "irrelevant" subspace while preserving retained knowledge. Overall, we use SAE features to construct a subspace that supervises unlearning, refining the loss and adding a regularization term to guide interpretable parameter updates. In experiments on the WMDP-Cyber forget set and three utility benchmarks (MMLU, TruthfulQA, GSM8K), SSPU reduces harmful knowledge accuracy by 3.22% compared to the strongest baseline. It also improves adversarial robustness, lowering malicious accuracy under jailbreak prompts compared to baselines. Our findings expose the limitations of prior unlearning methods and demonstrate how interpretable subspace-guided optimization can achieve robust, controllable model behavior.

<title>Exploring the Impact of Occupational Personas on Domain-Specific QA</title>

Abstract: Recent studies on personas have improved the way Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with users. However, the effect of personas on domain-specific question-answering (QA) tasks remains a subject of debate. This study analyzes whether personas enhance specialized QA performance by introducing two types of persona: Profession-Based Personas (PBPs) (e.g., scientist), which directly relate to domain expertise, and Occupational Personality-Based Personas (OPBPs) (e.g., scientific person), which reflect cognitive tendencies rather than explicit expertise. Through empirical evaluations across multiple scientific domains, we demonstrate that while PBPs can slightly improve accuracy, OPBPs often degrade performance, even when semantically related to the task. Our findings suggest that persona relevance alone does not guarantee effective knowledge utilization and that they may impose cognitive constraints that hinder optimal knowledge application. Future research can explore how nuanced distinctions in persona representations guide LLMs, potentially contributing to reasoning and knowledge retrieval that more closely mirror human social conceptualization.

<title>When Large Multimodal Models Confront Evolving Knowledge:Challenges and Pathways</title>

Abstract: Large language/multimodal models (LLMs/LMMs) store extensive pre-trained knowledge but struggle to maintain consistency with real-world updates, making it difficult to avoid catastrophic forgetting while acquiring evolving knowledge. Previous work focused on constructing textual knowledge datasets and exploring knowledge injection in LLMs, lacking exploration of multimodal evolving knowledge injection in LMMs. To address this, we propose the EVOKE benchmark to evaluate LMMs' ability to inject multimodal evolving knowledge in real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal evolving knowledge injection revealed two challenges: (1) Existing knowledge injection methods perform terribly on evolving knowledge. (2) Supervised fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting, particularly instruction following ability is severely compromised. Additionally, we provide pathways and find that: (1) Text knowledge augmentation during the training phase improves performance, while image augmentation cannot achieve it. (2) Continual learning methods, especially Replay and MoELoRA, effectively mitigate forgetting. Our findings indicate that current knowledge injection methods have many limitations on evolving knowledge, which motivates further research on more efficient and stable knowledge injection methods.

Abstract: This empirical study analyzes the effects of the pre-training corpus on the quality of learned transformer representations. We focus on the representation quality induced solely through pre-training. Our experiments show that pre-training on a small, specialized corpus can yield effective representations, and that the success of combining a generic and a specialized corpus depends on the distributional similarity between the target task and the specialized corpus.

Abstract: Cultural content poses challenges for machine translation systems due to the differences in conceptualizations between cultures, where language alone may fail to convey sufficient context to capture region-specific meanings. In this work, we investigate whether images can act as cultural context in multimodal translation. We introduce CaMMT, a human-curated benchmark of over 5,800 triples of images along with parallel captions in English and regional languages. Using this dataset, we evaluate five Vision Language Models (VLMs) in text-only and text+image settings. Through automatic and human evaluations, we find that visual context generally improves translation quality, especially in handling Culturally-Specific Items (CSIs), disambiguation, and correct gender usage. By releasing CaMMT, we aim to support broader efforts in building and evaluating multimodal translation systems that are better aligned with cultural nuance and regional variation.

Abstract: Machine translation systems fail when processing code-mixed inputs for low-resource languages. We address this challenge by curating VietMix, a parallel corpus of naturally occurring code-mixed Vietnamese text paired with expert English translations. Augmenting this resource, we developed a complementary synthetic data generation pipeline. This pipeline incorporates filtering mechanisms to ensure syntactic plausibility and pragmatic appropriateness in code-mixing patterns. Experimental validation shows our naturalistic and complementary synthetic data boost models' performance, measured by translation quality estimation scores, of up to 71.84 on COMETkiwi and 81.77 on XCOMET. Triangulating positive results with LLM-based assessments, augmented models are favored over seed fine-tuned counterparts in approximately 49% of judgments (54-56% excluding ties). VietMix and our augmentation methodology advance ecological validity in neural MT evaluations and establish a framework for addressing code-mixed translation challenges across other low-resource pairs.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate code-integrated reasoning, where models generate code when necessary and integrate feedback by executing it through a code interpreter. To acquire this capability, models must learn when and how to use external code tools effectively, which is supported by tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) through interactive learning. Despite its benefits, tool-augmented RL can still suffer from potential instability in the learning dynamics. In light of this challenge, we present a systematic approach to improving the training effectiveness and stability of tool-augmented RL for code-integrated reasoning. Specifically, we develop enhanced training strategies that balance exploration and stability, progressively building tool-use capabilities while improving reasoning performance. Through extensive experiments on five mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks, our model demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple competitive baselines. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanism and effect of code-integrated reasoning, revealing several key insights, such as the extension of model's capability boundaries and the simultaneous improvement of reasoning efficiency through code integration.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in IQ-related domains that require careful thinking, such as mathematics and coding. However, enhancing LLMs' cognitive development in social domains, particularly from a post-training perspective, remains underexplored. Recognizing that the social world follows a distinct timeline and requires a richer blend of cognitive modes (from intuitive reactions (System 1) and surface-level thinking to deliberate thinking (System 2)) than mathematics, which primarily relies on System 2 cognition (careful, step-by-step reasoning), we introduce Temporal-aware Hierarchical Cognitive Reinforcement Learning (TimeHC-RL) for enhancing LLMs' social intelligence. In our experiments, we systematically explore improving LLMs' social intelligence and validate the effectiveness of the TimeHC-RL method, through five other post-training paradigms and two test-time intervention paradigms on eight datasets with diverse data patterns. Experimental results reveal the superiority of our proposed TimeHC-RL method compared to the widely adopted System 2 RL method. It gives the 7B backbone model wings, enabling it to rival the performance of advanced models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O3. Additionally, the systematic exploration from post-training and test-time interventions perspectives to improve LLMs' social intelligence has uncovered several valuable insights.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic content, raising concerns about the potential for malicious use, such as misinformation and manipulation. Moreover, detecting Machine-Generated Text (MGT) remains challenging due to the lack of robust benchmarks that assess generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a pipeline to test the resilience of state-of-the-art MGT detectors (e.g., Mage, Radar, LLM-DetectAIve) to linguistically informed adversarial attacks. To challenge the detectors, we fine-tune language models using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to shift the MGT style toward human-written text (HWT). This exploits the detectors' reliance on stylistic clues, making new generations more challenging to detect. Additionally, we analyze the linguistic shifts induced by the alignment and which features are used by detectors to detect MGT texts. Our results show that detectors can be easily fooled with relatively few examples, resulting in a significant drop in detection performance. This highlights the importance of improving detection methods and making them robust to unseen in-domain texts.

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer from related high-resource languages is a well-established strategy to enhance low-resource language technologies. Prior work has shown that adapters show promise for, e.g., improving low-resource machine translation (MT). In this work, we investigate an adapter souping method combined with cross-attention fine-tuning of a pre-trained MT model to leverage language transfer for three low-resource Creole languages, which exhibit relatedness to different language groups across distinct linguistic dimensions. Our approach improves performance substantially over baselines. However, we find that linguistic relatedness -- or even a lack thereof -- does not covary meaningfully with adapter performance. Surprisingly, our cross-attention fine-tuning approach appears equally effective with randomly initialized adapters, implying that the benefit of adapters in this setting lies in parameter regularization, and not in meaningful information transfer. We provide analysis supporting this regularization hypothesis. Our findings underscore the reality that neural language processing involves many success factors, and that not all neural methods leverage linguistic knowledge in intuitive ways.

Abstract: LLMs often excel on standard benchmarks but falter on real-world tasks. We introduce DeepQuestion, a scalable automated framework that augments existing datasets based on Bloom's taxonomy and creates novel questions that trace original solution paths to probe evaluative and creative skills. Extensive experiments across ten open-source and proprietary models, covering both general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, reveal substantial performance drops (even up to 70% accuracy loss) on higher-order tasks, underscoring persistent gaps in deep reasoning. Our work highlights the need for cognitively diverse benchmarks to advance LLM progress. DeepQuestion and related datasets will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Cultural Heritage (CH) data hold invaluable knowledge, reflecting the history, traditions, and identities of societies, and shaping our understanding of the past and present. However, many CH collections contain outdated or offensive descriptions that reflect historical biases. CH Institutions (CHIs) face significant challenges in curating these data due to the vast scale and complexity of the task. To address this, we develop an AI-powered tool that detects offensive terms in CH metadata and provides contextual insights into their historical background and contemporary perception. We leverage a multilingual vocabulary co-created with marginalized communities, researchers, and CH professionals, along with traditional NLP techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs). Available as a standalone web app and integrated with major CH platforms, the tool has processed over 7.9 million records, contextualizing the contentious terms detected in their metadata. Rather than erasing these terms, our approach seeks to inform, making biases visible and providing actionable insights for creating more inclusive and accessible CH collections.

Abstract: We present a study on how and where personas -- defined by distinct sets of human characteristics, values, and beliefs -- are encoded in the representation space of large language models (LLMs). Using a range of dimension reduction and pattern recognition methods, we first identify the model layers that show the greatest divergence in encoding these representations. We then analyze the activations within a selected layer to examine how specific personas are encoded relative to others, including their shared and distinct embedding spaces. We find that, across multiple pre-trained decoder-only LLMs, the analyzed personas show large differences in representation space only within the final third of the decoder layers. We observe overlapping activations for specific ethical perspectives -- such as moral nihilism and utilitarianism -- suggesting a degree of polysemy. In contrast, political ideologies like conservatism and liberalism appear to be represented in more distinct regions. These findings help to improve our understanding of how LLMs internally represent information and can inform future efforts in refining the modulation of specific human traits in LLM outputs. Warning: This paper includes potentially offensive sample statements.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely adopted approach for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), particularly when the draft and target models are well aligned. However, state-of-the-art SD methods typically rely on tightly coupled, self-attention-based Transformer decoders, often augmented with auxiliary pooling or fusion layers. This coupling makes them increasingly complex and harder to generalize across different models. We present Budget EAGLE (Beagle), the first, to our knowledge, cross-attention-based Transformer decoder SD model that achieves performance on par with leading self-attention SD models (EAGLE-v2) while eliminating the need for pooling or auxiliary components, simplifying the architecture, improving training efficiency, and maintaining stable memory usage during training-time simulation. To enable effective training of this novel architecture, we propose Two-Stage Block-Attention Training, a new method that achieves training stability and convergence efficiency in block-level attention scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets show that Beagle achieves competitive inference speedups and higher training efficiency than EAGLE-v2, offering a strong alternative for architectures in speculative decoding.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve superior performance by extending the thought length. However, a lengthy thinking trajectory leads to reduced efficiency. Most of the existing methods are stuck in the assumption of overthinking and attempt to reason efficiently by compressing the Chain-of-Thought, but this often leads to performance degradation. To address this problem, we introduce A*-Thought, an efficient tree search-based unified framework designed to identify and isolate the most essential thoughts from the extensive reasoning chains produced by these models. It formulates the reasoning process of LRMs as a search tree, where each node represents a reasoning span in the giant reasoning space. By combining the A* search algorithm with a cost function specific to the reasoning path, it can efficiently compress the chain of thought and determine a reasoning path with high information density and low cost. In addition, we also propose a bidirectional importance estimation mechanism, which further refines this search process and enhances its efficiency beyond uniform sampling. Extensive experiments on several advanced math tasks show that A*-Thought effectively balances performance and efficiency over a huge search space. Specifically, A*-Thought can improve the performance of QwQ-32B by 2.39$\times$ with low-budget and reduce the length of the output token by nearly 50% with high-budget. The proposed method is also compatible with several other LRMs, demonstrating its generalization capability. The code can be accessed at: https://github.com/AI9Stars/AStar-Thought.

Abstract: Understanding complex character relations is crucial for narrative analysis and efficient script evaluation, yet existing extraction methods often fail to handle long-form narratives with nuanced interactions. To address this challenge, we present CREFT, a novel sequential framework leveraging specialized Large Language Model (LLM) agents. First, CREFT builds a base character graph through knowledge distillation, then iteratively refines character composition, relation extraction, role identification, and group assignments. Experiments on a curated Korean drama dataset demonstrate that CREFT significantly outperforms single-agent LLM baselines in both accuracy and completeness. By systematically visualizing character networks, CREFT streamlines narrative comprehension and accelerates script review -- offering substantial benefits to the entertainment, publishing, and educational sectors.

Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique opportunity to reinvigorate research on Knowledge Engineering (KE) automation, a trend already evident in recent efforts developing LLM-based methods and tools for the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs). However, the evaluation of these tools lacks standardisation. This undermines the methodological rigour and hinders the replication and comparison of results. To address this gap, we introduce Bench4KE, an extensible API-based benchmarking system for KE automation. Its first release focuses on evaluating tools that generate CQs automatically. CQs are natural language questions used by ontology engineers to define the functional requirements of an ontology. Bench4KE provides a curated gold standard consisting of CQ datasets from four real-world ontology projects. It uses a suite of similarity metrics to assess the quality of the CQs generated. We present a comparative analysis of four recent CQ generation systems, which are based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future research. Bench4KE is also designed to accommodate additional KE automation tasks, such as SPARQL query generation, ontology testing and drafting. Code and datasets are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

<title>Improving Language and Modality Transfer in Translation by Character-level Modeling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24561</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current translation systems, despite being highly multilingual, cover only 5% of the world's languages. Expanding language coverage to the long-tail of low-resource languages requires data-efficient methods that rely on cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose a character-based approach to improve adaptability to new languages and modalities. Our method leverages SONAR, a multilingual fixed-size embedding space with different modules for encoding and decoding. We use a teacher-student approach with parallel translation data to obtain a character-level encoder. Then, using ASR data, we train a lightweight adapter to connect a massively multilingual CTC ASR model (MMS), to the character-level encoder, potentially enabling speech translation from 1,000+ languages. Experimental results in text translation for 75 languages on FLORES+ demonstrate that our character-based approach can achieve better language transfer than traditional subword-based models, especially outperforming them in low-resource settings, and demonstrating better zero-shot generalizability to unseen languages. Our speech adaptation, maximizing knowledge transfer from the text modality, achieves state-of-the-art results in speech-to-text translation on the FLEURS benchmark on 33 languages, surpassing previous supervised and cascade models, albeit being a zero-shot model with minimal supervision from ASR data.

Abstract: Summarizing long-form narratives--such as books, movies, and TV scripts--requires capturing intricate plotlines, character interactions, and thematic coherence, a task that remains challenging for existing LLMs. We introduce NexusSum, a multi-agent LLM framework for narrative summarization that processes long-form text through a structured, sequential pipeline--without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Dialogue-to-Description Transformation: A narrative-specific preprocessing method that standardizes character dialogue and descriptive text into a unified format, improving coherence. (2) Hierarchical Multi-LLM Summarization: A structured summarization pipeline that optimizes chunk processing and controls output length for accurate, high-quality summaries. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art in narrative summarization, achieving up to a 30.0% improvement in BERTScore (F1) across books, movies, and TV scripts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-agent LLMs in handling long-form content, offering a scalable approach for structured summarization in diverse storytelling domains.

Abstract: Semantic textual similarity (STS) is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), enabling applications in retrieval, clustering, and understanding semantic relationships between texts. However, research in this area for the Arabic language remains limited due to the lack of high-quality datasets and pre-trained models. This scarcity of resources has restricted the accurate evaluation and advance of semantic similarity in Arabic text. This paper introduces General Arabic Text Embedding (GATE) models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Semantic Textual Similarity task within the MTEB benchmark. GATE leverages Matryoshka Representation Learning and a hybrid loss training approach with Arabic triplet datasets for Natural Language Inference, which are essential for enhancing model performance in tasks that demand fine-grained semantic understanding. GATE outperforms larger models, including OpenAI, with a 20-25% performance improvement on STS benchmarks, effectively capturing the unique semantic nuances of Arabic.

<title>Decoding Knowledge Attribution in Mixture-of-Experts: A Framework of Basic-Refinement Collaboration and Efficiency Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE, Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mixtral-7B). Results show MoE models achieve 37% higher per-layer efficiency via a "mid-activation, late-amplification" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a "basic-refinement" framework--shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination. Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10 experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency, specialization, and robustness.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for improved explainability in text-based depression detection. While offering predictive outcomes, current solutions often overlook the understanding of model predictions which can hinder trust in the system. We propose the use of Masked Hard Instance Mining (MHIM) to enhance the explainability in the depression detection task. MHIM strategically masks attention weights within the model, compelling it to distribute attention across a wider range of salient features. We evaluate MHIM on two datasets representing distinct languages: Thai (Thai-Maywe) and English (DAIC-WOZ). Our results demonstrate that MHIM significantly improves performance in terms of both prediction accuracy and explainability metrics.

Abstract: Endowing dialogue agents with persona information has proven to significantly improve the consistency and diversity of their generations. While much focus has been placed on aligning dialogues with provided personas, the adaptation to the interlocutor's profile remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate three key aspects: (1) a model's ability to align responses with both the provided persona and the interlocutor's; (2) its robustness when dealing with familiar versus unfamiliar interlocutors and topics, and (3) the impact of additional fine-tuning on specific persona-based dialogues. We evaluate dialogues generated with diverse speaker pairings and topics, framing the evaluation as an author identification task and employing both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations. By systematically masking or disclosing information about the interlocutor, we assess its impact on dialogue generation. Results show that access to the interlocutor's persona improves the recognition of the target speaker, while masking it does the opposite. Although models generalise well across topics, they struggle with unfamiliar interlocutors. Finally, we found that in zero-shot settings, LLMs often copy biographical details, facilitating identification but trivialising the task.

Abstract: In an era of exponential scientific growth, identifying novel research ideas is crucial and challenging in academia. Despite potential, the lack of an appropriate benchmark dataset hinders the research of novelty detection. More importantly, simply adopting existing NLP technologies, e.g., retrieving and then cross-checking, is not a one-size-fits-all solution due to the gap between textual similarity and idea conception. In this paper, we propose to harness large language models (LLMs) for scientific novelty detection (ND), associated with two new datasets in marketing and NLP domains. To construct the considerate datasets for ND, we propose to extract closure sets of papers based on their relationship, and then summarize their main ideas based on LLMs. To capture idea conception, we propose to train a lightweight retriever by distilling the idea-level knowledge from LLMs to align ideas with similar conception, enabling efficient and accurate idea retrieval for LLM novelty detection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms others on the proposed benchmark datasets for idea retrieval and ND tasks. Codes and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/NoveltyDetection-10FB/.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce POLLUX, a comprehensive open-source benchmark designed to evaluate the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Russian. Our main contribution is a novel evaluation methodology that enhances the interpretability of LLM assessment. For each task type, we define a set of detailed criteria and develop a scoring protocol where models evaluate responses and provide justifications for their ratings. This enables transparent, criteria-driven evaluation beyond traditional resource-consuming, side-by-side human comparisons. POLLUX includes a detailed, fine-grained taxonomy of 35 task types covering diverse generative domains such as code generation, creative writing, and practical assistant use cases, totaling 2,100 manually crafted and professionally authored prompts. Each task is categorized by difficulty (easy/medium/hard), with experts constructing the dataset entirely from scratch. We also release a family of LLM-as-a-Judge (7B and 32B) evaluators trained for nuanced assessment of generative outputs. This approach provides scalable, interpretable evaluation and annotation tools for model development, effectively replacing costly and less precise human judgments.

Abstract: Objective: Heart failure (HF) patients present with diverse phenotypes affecting treatment and prognosis. This study evaluates models for phenotyping HF patients based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) classes, using structured and unstructured data, assessing performance and interpretability.
  Materials and Methods: The study analyzes all HF hospitalizations at both Amsterdam UMC hospitals (AMC and VUmc) from 2015 to 2023 (33,105 hospitalizations, 16,334 patients). Data from AMC were used for model training, and from VUmc for external validation. The dataset was unlabelled and included tabular clinical measurements and discharge letters. Silver labels for LVEF classes were generated by combining diagnosis codes, echocardiography results, and textual mentions. Gold labels were manually annotated for 300 patients for testing. Multiple Transformer-based (black-box) and Aug-Linear (white-box) models were trained and compared with baselines on structured and unstructured data. To evaluate interpretability, two clinicians annotated 20 discharge letters by highlighting information they considered relevant for LVEF classification. These were compared to SHAP and LIME explanations from black-box models and the inherent explanations of Aug-Linear models.
  Results: BERT-based and Aug-Linear models, using discharge letters alone, achieved the highest classification results (AUC=0.84 for BERT, 0.81 for Aug-Linear on external validation), outperforming baselines. Aug-Linear explanations aligned more closely with clinicians' explanations than post-hoc explanations on black-box models.
  Conclusions: Discharge letters emerged as the most informative source for phenotyping HF patients. Aug-Linear models matched black-box performance while providing clinician-aligned interpretability, supporting their use in transparent clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding and generation, leading to extensive benchmarking across diverse tasks. However, cryptanalysis a critical area for data security and encryption has not yet been thoroughly explored in LLM evaluations. To address this gap, we evaluate cryptanalytic potential of state of the art LLMs on encrypted texts generated using a range of cryptographic algorithms. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset comprising diverse plain texts spanning various domains, lengths, writing styles, and topics paired with their encrypted versions. Using zero-shot and few shot settings, we assess multiple LLMs for decryption accuracy and semantic comprehension across different encryption schemes. Our findings reveal key insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in side-channel communication while raising concerns about their susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks. This research highlights the dual-use nature of LLMs in security contexts and contributes to the ongoing discussion on AI safety and security.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced in reasoning tasks through reinforcement learning (RL) optimization, achieving impressive capabilities across various challenging benchmarks. However, our empirical analysis reveals a critical drawback: reasoning-oriented RL fine-tuning significantly increases the prevalence of hallucinations. We theoretically analyze the RL training dynamics, identifying high-variance gradient, entropy-induced randomness, and susceptibility to spurious local optima as key factors leading to hallucinations. To address this drawback, we propose Factuality-aware Step-wise Policy Optimization (FSPO), an innovative RL fine-tuning algorithm incorporating explicit factuality verification at each reasoning step. FSPO leverages automated verification against given evidence to dynamically adjust token-level advantage values, incentivizing factual correctness throughout the reasoning process. Experiments across mathematical reasoning and hallucination benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Llama models demonstrate that FSPO effectively reduces hallucinations while enhancing reasoning accuracy, substantially improving both reliability and performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces a Dual Evaluation Framework to comprehensively assess the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. By decomposing the evaluation along the dimensions of linguistic medium and cultural context, this framework enables a nuanced analysis of LLMs' ability to process questions within both native and cross-cultural contexts cross-lingually. Extensive evaluations are conducted on a wide range of models, revealing a notable "CulturalLinguistic Synergy" phenomenon, where models exhibit better performance when questions are culturally aligned with the language. This phenomenon is further explored through interpretability probing, which shows that a higher proportion of specific neurons are activated in a language's cultural context. This activation proportion could serve as a potential indicator for evaluating multilingual performance during model training. Our findings challenge the prevailing notion that LLMs, primarily trained on English data, perform uniformly across languages and highlight the necessity of culturally and linguistically model evaluations. Our code can be found at https://yingjiahao14. github.io/Dual-Evaluation/.

Abstract: Labor market analysis relies on extracting insights from job advertisements, which provide valuable yet unstructured information on job titles and corresponding skill requirements. While state-of-the-art methods for skill extraction achieve strong performance, they depend on large language models (LLMs), which are computationally expensive and slow. In this paper, we propose \textbf{ConTeXT-match}, a novel contrastive learning approach with token-level attention that is well-suited for the extreme multi-label classification task of skill classification. \textbf{ConTeXT-match} significantly improves skill extraction efficiency and performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with a lightweight bi-encoder model. To support robust evaluation, we introduce \textbf{Skill-XL}, a new benchmark with exhaustive, sentence-level skill annotations that explicitly address the redundancy in the large label space. Finally, we present \textbf{JobBERT V2}, an improved job title normalization model that leverages extracted skills to produce high-quality job title representations. Experiments demonstrate that our models are efficient, accurate, and scalable, making them ideal for large-scale, real-time labor market analysis.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for analyzing sorting algorithms in pairwise ranking prompting (PRP), re-centering the cost model around LLM inferences rather than traditional pairwise comparisons. While classical metrics based on comparison counts have traditionally been used to gauge efficiency, our analysis reveals that expensive LLM inferences overturn these predictions; accordingly, our framework encourages strategies such as batching and caching to mitigate inference costs. We show that algorithms optimal in the classical setting can lose efficiency when LLM inferences dominate the cost under certain optimizations.

<title>PRISM: A Framework for Producing Interpretable Political Bias Embeddings with Political-Aware Cross-Encoder</title>

arXiv:2505.24646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Text Embedding is a fundamental NLP task that encodes textual content into vector representations, where proximity in the embedding space reflects semantic similarity. While existing embedding models excel at capturing general meaning, they often overlook ideological nuances, limiting their effectiveness in tasks that require an understanding of political bias. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM, the first framework designed to Produce inteRpretable polItical biaS eMbeddings. PRISM operates in two key stages: (1) Controversial Topic Bias Indicator Mining, which systematically extracts fine-grained political topics and their corresponding bias indicators from weakly labeled news data, and (2) Cross-Encoder Political Bias Embedding, which assigns structured bias scores to news articles based on their alignment with these indicators. This approach ensures that embeddings are explicitly tied to bias-revealing dimensions, enhancing both interpretability and predictive power. Through extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, we demonstrate that PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art text embedding models in political bias classification while offering highly interpretable representations that facilitate diversified retrieval and ideological analysis. The source code is available at https://github.com/dukesun99/ACL-PRISM.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Meta PL unsupervised domain adaptation framework for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We introduce a Multi-Stage Domain Adaptation pipeline (MSDA), a sample-efficient, two-stage adaptation approach that integrates self-supervised learning with semi-supervised techniques. MSDA is designed to enhance the robustness and generalization of ASR models, making them more adaptable to diverse conditions. It is particularly effective for low-resource languages like Greek and in weakly supervised scenarios where labeled data is scarce or noisy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Meta PL can be applied effectively to ASR tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and providing more robust solutions for unsupervised domain adaptation in ASR. Our ablations highlight the necessity of utilizing a cascading approach when combining self-supervision with self-training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt their predictions to diverse cultural contexts to benefit diverse communities across the world. While previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs (and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably, multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies comparable to that of a much larger model (27B parameters).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing tasks but remain vulnerable to generating harmful content or being exploited for malicious purposes. Although safety alignment datasets have been introduced to mitigate such risks through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these datasets often lack comprehensive risk coverage. Most existing datasets focus primarily on lexical diversity while neglecting other critical dimensions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel analysis framework to systematically measure the risk coverage of alignment datasets across three essential dimensions: Lexical Diversity, Malicious Intent, and Jailbreak Tactics. We further introduce TRIDENT, an automated pipeline that leverages persona-based, zero-shot LLM generation to produce diverse and comprehensive instructions spanning these dimensions. Each harmful instruction is paired with an ethically aligned response, resulting in two datasets: TRIDENT-Core, comprising 26,311 examples, and TRIDENT-Edge, with 18,773 examples.

<title>A Simple Linear Patch Revives Layer-Pruned Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Layer pruning has become a popular technique for compressing large language models (LLMs) due to its simplicity. However, existing layer pruning methods often suffer from significant performance drops. We identify that this degradation stems from the mismatch of activation magnitudes across layers and tokens at the pruning interface. To address this, we propose LinearPatch, a simple plug-and-play technique to revive the layer-pruned LLMs. The proposed method adopts Hadamard transformation to suppress massive outliers in particular tokens, and channel-wise scaling to align the activation magnitudes. These operations can be fused into a single matrix, which functions as a patch to bridge the pruning interface with negligible inference overhead. LinearPatch retains up to 94.15% performance of the original model when pruning 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B on the question answering benchmark, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods by 4%. In addition, the patch matrix can be further optimized with memory efficient offline knowledge distillation. With only 5K samples, the retained performance of LinearPatch can be further boosted to 95.16% within 30 minutes on a single computing card.

<title>Should I Share this Translation? Evaluating Quality Feedback for User Reliance on Machine Translation</title>

Abstract: As people increasingly use AI systems in work and daily life, feedback mechanisms that help them use AI responsibly are urgently needed, particularly in settings where users are not equipped to assess the quality of AI predictions. We study a realistic Machine Translation (MT) scenario where monolingual users decide whether to share an MT output, first without and then with quality feedback. We compare four types of quality feedback: explicit feedback that directly give users an assessment of translation quality using 1) error highlights and 2) LLM explanations, and implicit feedback that helps users compare MT inputs and outputs through 3) backtranslation and 4) question-answer (QA) tables. We find that all feedback types, except error highlights, significantly improve both decision accuracy and appropriate reliance. Notably, implicit feedback, especially QA tables, yields significantly greater gains than explicit feedback in terms of decision accuracy, appropriate reliance, and user perceptions, receiving the highest ratings for helpfulness and trust, and the lowest for mental burden.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex reasoning due to limited diversity and inefficient search. We propose Soft Reasoning, an embedding-based search framework that optimises the embedding of the first token to guide generation. It combines (1) embedding perturbation for controlled exploration and (2) Bayesian optimisation to refine embeddings via a verifier-guided objective, balancing exploration and exploitation. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and coherence while avoiding reliance on heuristic search. Experiments demonstrate superior correctness with minimal computation, making it a scalable, model-agnostic solution.

<title>BPE Stays on SCRIPT: Structured Encoding for Robust Multilingual Pretokenization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers, widely used in Large Language Models, face challenges in multilingual settings, including penalization of non-Western scripts and the creation of tokens with partial UTF-8 sequences. Pretokenization, often reliant on complex regular expressions, can also introduce fragility and unexpected edge cases. We propose SCRIPT (Script Category Representation in PreTokenization), a novel encoding scheme that bypasses UTF-8 byte conversion by using initial tokens based on Unicode script and category properties. This approach enables a simple, rule-based pretokenization strategy that respects script boundaries, offering a robust alternative to pretokenization strategies based on regular expressions. We also introduce and validate a constrained BPE merging strategy that enforces character integrity, applicable to both SCRIPT-BPE and byte-based BPE. Our experiments demonstrate that SCRIPT-BPE achieves competitive compression while eliminating encoding-based penalties for non-Latin-script languages.

<title>Speech-to-Text Translation with Phoneme-Augmented CoT: Enhancing Cross-Lingual Transfer in Low-Resource Scenarios</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) approach that integrates phoneme representations into a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework to improve translation in low-resource and zero-resource settings. By introducing phoneme recognition as an intermediate step, we enhance cross-lingual transfer, enabling translation even for languages with no labeled speech data. Our system builds on a multilingual LLM, which we extend to process speech and phonemes. Training follows a curriculum learning strategy that progressively introduces more complex tasks. Experiments on multilingual S2TT benchmarks show that phoneme-augmented CoT improves translation quality in low-resource conditions and enables zero-resource translation, while slightly impacting high-resource performance. Despite this trade-off, our findings demonstrate that phoneme-based CoT is a promising step toward making S2TT more accessible across diverse languages.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) offers granular insights into opinions but often suffers from the scarcity of diverse, labeled datasets that reflect real-world conversational nuances. This paper presents an approach for generating synthetic ABSA data using Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this gap. We detail the generation process aimed at producing data with consistent topic and sentiment distributions across multiple domains using GPT-4o. The quality and utility of the generated data were evaluated by assessing the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1) on topic and sentiment classification tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the synthetic data, revealing distinct performance trade-offs among the models: DeepSeekR1 showed higher precision, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibited strong recall, and Gemini 1.5 Pro offered significantly faster inference. We conclude that LLM-based synthetic data generation is a viable and flexible method for creating valuable ABSA resources, facilitating research and model evaluation without reliance on limited or inaccessible real-world labeled data.

Abstract: Most resources for evaluating social biases in Large Language Models are developed without co-design from the communities affected by these biases, and rarely involve participatory approaches. We introduce HESEIA, a dataset of 46,499 sentences created in a professional development course. The course involved 370 high-school teachers and 5,370 students from 189 Latin-American schools. Unlike existing benchmarks, HESEIA captures intersectional biases across multiple demographic axes and school subjects. It reflects local contexts through the lived experience and pedagogical expertise of educators. Teachers used minimal pairs to create sentences that express stereotypes relevant to their school subjects and communities. We show the dataset diversity in term of demographic axes represented and also in terms of the knowledge areas included. We demonstrate that the dataset contains more stereotypes unrecognized by current LLMs than previous datasets. HESEIA is available to support bias assessments grounded in educational communities.

Abstract: Arabic dialect identification (ADI) systems are essential for large-scale data collection pipelines that enable the development of inclusive speech technologies for Arabic language varieties. However, the reliability of current ADI systems is limited by poor generalization to out-of-domain speech. In this paper, we present an effective approach based on voice conversion for training ADI models that achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves robustness in cross-domain scenarios. Evaluated on a newly collected real-world test set spanning four different domains, our approach yields consistent improvements of up to +34.1% in accuracy across domains. Furthermore, we present an analysis of our approach and demonstrate that voice conversion helps mitigate the speaker bias in the ADI dataset. We release our robust ADI model and cross-domain evaluation dataset to support the development of inclusive speech technologies for Arabic.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid development in recent years. However, in the financial domain, there is a notable lack of effective and specialized multimodal evaluation datasets. To advance the development of MLLMs in the finance domain, we introduce FinMME, encompassing more than 11,000 high-quality financial research samples across 18 financial domains and 6 asset classes, featuring 10 major chart types and 21 subtypes. We ensure data quality through 20 annotators and carefully designed validation mechanisms. Additionally, we develop FinScore, an evaluation system incorporating hallucination penalties and multi-dimensional capability assessment to provide an unbiased evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o exhibit unsatisfactory performance on FinMME, highlighting its challenging nature. The benchmark exhibits high robustness with prediction variations under different prompts remaining below 1%, demonstrating superior reliability compared to existing datasets. Our dataset and evaluation protocol are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/luojunyu/FinMME and https://github.com/luo-junyu/FinMME.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a method for improving the performance of large language models through self-reflection and reinforcement learning. By incentivizing the model to generate better self-reflections when it answers incorrectly, we demonstrate that a model's ability to solve complex, verifiable tasks can be enhanced even when generating synthetic data is infeasible and only binary feedback is available. Our framework operates in two stages: first, upon failing a given task, the model generates a self-reflective commentary analyzing its previous attempt; second, the model is given another attempt at the task with the self-reflection in context. If the subsequent attempt succeeds, the tokens generated during the self-reflection phase are rewarded. Our experimental results show substantial performance gains across a variety of model architectures, as high as 34.7% improvement at math equation writing and 18.1% improvement at function calling. Notably, smaller fine-tuned models (1.5 billion to 7 billion parameters) outperform models in the same family that are 10 times larger. Our novel paradigm is thus an exciting pathway to more useful and reliable language models that can self-improve on challenging tasks with limited external feedback.

arXiv:2505.24731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensively evaluating the capabilities of (large) language models is difficult. Rapid development of state-of-the-art models induce benchmark saturation, while creating more challenging datasets is labor-intensive. Inspired by the recent developments in mechanistic interpretability, we introduce circuit stability as a new way to assess model performance. Circuit stability refers to a model's ability to apply a consistent reasoning process-its circuit-across various inputs. We mathematically formalize circuit stability and circuit equivalence. Then, through three case studies, we empirically show that circuit stability and the lack thereof can characterize and predict different aspects of generalization. Our proposed methods offer a step towards rigorously relating the generality of models to their interpretability.

<title>Don't Reinvent the Wheel: Efficient Instruction-Following Text Embedding based on Guided Space Transformation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate an important task named instruction-following text embedding, which generates dynamic text embeddings that adapt to user instructions, highlighting specific attributes of text. Despite recent advancements, existing approaches suffer from significant computational overhead, as they require re-encoding the entire corpus for each new instruction. To address this challenge, we propose GSTransform, a novel instruction-following text embedding framework based on Guided Space Transformation. Our key observation is that instruction-relevant information is inherently encoded in generic embeddings but remains underutilized. Instead of repeatedly encoding the corpus for each instruction, GSTransform is a lightweight transformation mechanism that adapts pre-computed embeddings in real time to align with user instructions, guided by a small amount of text data with instruction-focused label annotation. We conduct extensive experiments on three instruction-awareness downstream tasks across nine real-world datasets, demonstrating that GSTransform improves instruction-following text embedding quality over state-of-the-art methods while achieving dramatic speedups of 6~300x in real-time processing on large-scale datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/YingchaojieFeng/GSTransform.

<title>LGAR: Zero-Shot LLM-Guided Neural Ranking for Abstract Screening in Systematic Literature Reviews</title>

Abstract: The scientific literature is growing rapidly, making it hard to keep track of the state-of-the-art. Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) aim to identify and evaluate all relevant papers on a topic. After retrieving a set of candidate papers, the abstract screening phase determines initial relevance. To date, abstract screening methods using large language models (LLMs) focus on binary classification settings; existing question answering (QA) based ranking approaches suffer from error propagation. LLMs offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the SLR's inclusion and exclusion criteria, yet, existing benchmarks do not provide them exhaustively. We manually extract these criteria as well as research questions for 57 SLRs, mostly in the medical domain, enabling principled comparisons between approaches. Moreover, we propose LGAR, a zero-shot LLM Guided Abstract Ranker composed of an LLM based graded relevance scorer and a dense re-ranker. Our extensive experiments show that LGAR outperforms existing QA-based methods by 5-10 pp. in mean average precision. Our code and data is publicly available.

<title>From Macro to Micro: Probing Dataset Diversity in Language Model Fine-Tuning</title>

arXiv:2505.24768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset diversity plays a pivotal role for the successful training of many machine learning models, particularly in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage of large language model (LLM) development. Despite increasing recognition of its importance, systematic analyses of dataset diversity still remain underexplored. To address this gap, this work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing diversity-control strategies, which primarily focus on the instruction component, operating at either macroscopic (entire instruction semantics) or mesoscopic levels (instruction units), and furthermore introduces a novel analysis of microscopic diversity within the response component, specifically analyzing the statistical distribution of tokens in SFT training samples. In the experimental evaluation, we construct fixed-size datasets (e.g., 10,000 samples each) from a corpus of 117,000 open-source SFT samples, incorporating six distinct diversity-control strategies spanning macro-, meso-, and microscopic levels applied to both instructions and responses. We then fine-tune LLMs on these datasets to assess the six diversity-control strategies. Results reveal that while macroscopic and mesoscopic strategies lead to higher performance with increasing diversity, the microscopic strategy in responses exhibits both a stronger correlation between model performance and the degree of diversity and superior performance with maximum diversity across all strategies. These findings offer actionable insights for constructing high-performance SFT datasets.

<title>Revisiting Epistemic Markers in Confidence Estimation: Can Markers Accurately Reflect Large Language Models' Uncertainty?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, accurately assessing their confidence is crucial. Humans typically express confidence through epistemic markers (e.g., "fairly confident") instead of numerical values. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs consistently use these markers to reflect their intrinsic confidence due to the difficulty of quantifying uncertainty associated with various markers. To address this gap, we first define marker confidence as the observed accuracy when a model employs an epistemic marker. We evaluate its stability across multiple question-answering datasets in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings for open-source and proprietary LLMs. Our results show that while markers generalize well within the same distribution, their confidence is inconsistent in out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings raise significant concerns about the reliability of epistemic markers for confidence estimation, underscoring the need for improved alignment between marker based confidence and actual model uncertainty. Our code is available at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarCon.

<title>Drop Dropout on Single-Epoch Language Model Pretraining</title>

arXiv:2505.24788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally, dropout was seen as a breakthrough regularization technique that reduced overfitting and improved performance in almost all applications of deep learning by reducing overfitting. Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to modern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for large LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on the role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch pretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs with varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language modeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and natural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during pretraining. We additionally find that the recently-introduced "early dropout" also degrades performance over applying no dropout at all. We further investigate the models' editability, and find that models trained without dropout are more successful in gradient-based model editing (MEND) and equivalent in representation-based model editing (ReFT). Therefore, we advocate to drop dropout during single-epoch pretraining.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automated story generation, but challenges remain in maintaining long-form coherence and providing users with intuitive and effective control. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in reducing hallucinations in text generation; however, the use of structured data to support generative storytelling remains underexplored. This paper investigates how knowledge graphs (KGs) can enhance LLM-based storytelling by improving narrative quality and enabling user-driven modifications. We propose a KG-assisted storytelling pipeline and evaluate its effectiveness through a user study with 15 participants. Participants created their own story prompts, generated stories, and edited knowledge graphs to shape their narratives. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, our findings demonstrate that knowledge graphs significantly enhance story quality in action-oriented and structured narratives within our system settings. Additionally, editing the knowledge graph increases users' sense of control, making storytelling more engaging, interactive, and playful.

arXiv:2505.24826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in legal applications, current evaluation benchmarks tend to focus mainly on factual accuracy while largely neglecting important linguistic quality aspects such as clarity, coherence, and terminology. To address this gap, we propose three steps: First, we develop a regression model to evaluate the quality of legal texts based on clarity, coherence, and terminology. Second, we create a specialized set of legal questions. Third, we analyze 49 LLMs using this evaluation framework.
  Our analysis identifies three key findings: First, model quality levels off at 14 billion parameters, with only a marginal improvement of $2.7\%$ noted at 72 billion parameters. Second, engineering choices such as quantization and context length have a negligible impact, as indicated by statistical significance thresholds above 0.016. Third, reasoning models consistently outperform base architectures. A significant outcome of our research is the release of a ranking list and Pareto analysis, which highlight the Qwen3 series as the optimal choice for cost-performance tradeoffs. This work not only establishes standardized evaluation protocols for legal LLMs but also uncovers fundamental limitations in current training data refinement approaches. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/lyxx3rd/LegalEval-Q.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit extensive medical knowledge but are prone to hallucinations and inaccurate citations, which pose a challenge to their clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. Current methods, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation, partially address these issues by grounding answers in source documents, but hallucinations and low fact-level explainability persist. In this work, we introduce a novel atomic fact-checking framework designed to enhance the reliability and explainability of LLMs used in medical long-form question answering. This method decomposes LLM-generated responses into discrete, verifiable units called atomic facts, each of which is independently verified against an authoritative knowledge base of medical guidelines. This approach enables targeted correction of errors and direct tracing to source literature, thereby improving the factual accuracy and explainability of medical Q&amp;A. Extensive evaluation using multi-reader assessments by medical experts and an automated open Q&amp;A benchmark demonstrated significant improvements in factual accuracy and explainability. Our framework achieved up to a 40% overall answer improvement and a 50% hallucination detection rate. The ability to trace each atomic fact back to the most relevant chunks from the database provides a granular, transparent explanation of the generated responses, addressing a major gap in current medical AI applications. This work represents a crucial step towards more trustworthy and reliable clinical applications of LLMs, addressing key prerequisites for clinical application and fostering greater confidence in AI-assisted healthcare.

Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating how much a model ``knows'' about a datapoint and use it to measure the capacity of modern language models. Prior studies of language model memorization have struggled to disentangle memorization from generalization. We formally separate memorization into two components: \textit{unintended memorization}, the information a model contains about a specific dataset, and \textit{generalization}, the information a model contains about the true data-generation process. When we completely eliminate generalization, we can compute the total memorization, which provides an estimate of model capacity: our measurements estimate that GPT-style models have a capacity of approximately 3.6 bits per parameter. We train language models on datasets of increasing size and observe that models memorize until their capacity fills, at which point ``grokking'' begins, and unintended memorization decreases as models begin to generalize. We train hundreds of transformer language models ranging from $500K$ to $1.5B$ parameters and produce a series of scaling laws relating model capacity and data size to membership inference.

<title>Multilinguality Does not Make Sense: Investigating Factors Behind Zero-Shot Transfer in Sense-Aware Tasks</title>

arXiv:2505.24834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer allows models to perform tasks in languages unseen during training and is often assumed to benefit from increased multilinguality. In this work, we challenge this assumption in the context of two underexplored, sense-aware tasks: polysemy disambiguation and lexical semantic change. Through a large-scale analysis across 28 languages, we show that multilingual training is neither necessary nor inherently beneficial for effective transfer. Instead, we find that confounding factors - such as fine-tuning data composition and evaluation artifacts - better account for the perceived advantages of multilinguality. Our findings call for more rigorous evaluations in multilingual NLP. We release fine-tuned models and benchmarks to support further research, with implications extending to low-resource and typologically diverse languages.

Abstract: A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty communication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false claims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first systematic study of $\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs, benchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that $\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a comprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results demonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing interventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only marginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even harm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce MetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human metacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration across diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in faithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged by humans.

<title>AlphaOne: Reasoning Models Thinking Slow and Fast at Test Time</title>

Abstract: This paper presents AlphaOne ($\alpha$1), a universal framework for modulating reasoning progress in large reasoning models (LRMs) at test time. $\alpha$1 first introduces $\alpha$ moment, which represents the scaled thinking phase with a universal parameter $\alpha$. Within this scaled pre-$\alpha$ moment phase, it dynamically schedules slow thinking transitions by modeling the insertion of reasoning transition tokens as a Bernoulli stochastic process. After the $\alpha$ moment, $\alpha$1 deterministically terminates slow thinking with the end-of-thinking token, thereby fostering fast reasoning and efficient answer generation. This approach unifies and generalizes existing monotonic scaling methods by enabling flexible and dense slow-to-fast reasoning modulation. Extensive empirical studies on various challenging benchmarks across mathematical, coding, and scientific domains demonstrate $\alpha$1's superior reasoning capability and efficiency.

<title>ProRL: Prolonged Reinforcement Learning Expands Reasoning Boundaries in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric language models have highlighted reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising method for aligning models with verifiable rewards. However, it remains contentious whether RL truly expands a model's reasoning capabilities or merely amplifies high-reward outputs already latent in the base model's distribution, and whether continually scaling up RL compute reliably leads to improved reasoning performance. In this work, we challenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL) training can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base models, even under extensive sampling. We introduce ProRL, a novel training methodology that incorporates KL divergence control, reference policy resetting, and a diverse suite of tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals that RL-trained models consistently outperform base models across a wide range of pass@k evaluations, including scenarios where base models fail entirely regardless of the number of attempts. We further show that reasoning boundary improvements correlates strongly with task competence of base model and training duration, suggesting that RL can explore and populate new regions of solution space over time. These findings offer new insights into the conditions under which RL meaningfully expands reasoning boundaries in language models and establish a foundation for future work on long-horizon RL for reasoning.

<title>Boosting In-Context Learning in LLMs Through the Lens of Classical Supervised Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23783</link>

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with just a few examples, but their predictions often suffer from systematic biases, leading to unstable performances in classification. While calibration techniques are proposed to mitigate these biases, we show that, in the logit space, many of these methods are equivalent to merely shifting the LLM's decision boundary without having the ability to alter its orientation. This proves inadequate when biases cause the LLM to be severely misdirected. To address these limitations and provide a unifying framework, we propose Supervised Calibration (SC), a loss-minimization based framework which learns an optimal, per-class affine transformation of the LLM's predictive probabilities in the logit space without requiring external data beyond the context. By using a more expressive functional class, SC not only subsumes many existing calibration methods in ICL as special cases, but also enables the ability to alter and even completely reverse the orientation of the LLM's decision boundary. Furthermore, SC's loss-based nature facilitates the seamless integration of two purpose-built regularization techniques: context-invariance and directional trust-region. The former is designed to tackle the instability issue in ICL, while the latter controls the degree of calibration. Finally, SC delivers state-of-the-art performance over calibration baselines in the 4-shot, 8-shot, and 16-shot settings across all nine datasets for Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, LLaMA-2-7B-chat, and Qwen2-7B-Instruct.

<title>SkewRoute: Training-Free LLM Routing for Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Score Skewness of Retrieved Context</title>

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but often incur high inference costs during deployment. To mitigate hallucination, many systems use a knowledge graph to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG). However, the large amount of retrieved knowledge contexts increase these inference costs further. A promising solution to balance performance and cost is LLM routing, which directs simple queries to smaller LLMs and complex ones to larger LLMs. However, no dedicated routing methods currently exist for RAG, and existing training-based routers face challenges scaling to this domain due to the need for extensive training data. We observe that the score distributions produced by the retrieval scorer strongly correlate with query difficulty. Based on this, we propose a novel, training-free routing framework, the first tailored to KG-RAG that effectively balances performance and cost in a plug-and-play manner. Experiments show our method reduces calls to larger LLMs by up to 50% without sacrificing response quality, demonstrating its potential for efficient and scalable LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning are trained to iteratively generate and refine their answers before finalizing them, which can help with applications to mathematics and code generation. We apply code generation with reasoning LLMs to a specific task in the mathematical field of combinatorial design. This field studies diverse types of combinatorial designs, many of which have lists of open instances for which existence has not yet been determined. The Constructive Protocol CPro1 uses LLMs to generate search heuristics that have the potential to construct solutions to small open instances. Starting with a textual definition and a validity verifier for a particular type of design, CPro1 guides LLMs to select and implement strategies, while providing automated hyperparameter tuning and execution feedback. CPro1 with reasoning LLMs successfully solves long-standing open instances for 7 of 16 combinatorial design problems selected from the 2006 Handbook of Combinatorial Designs, including new solved instances for 3 of these (Bhaskar Rao Designs, Symmetric Weighing Matrices, Balanced Ternary Designs) that were unsolved by CPro1 with non-reasoning LLMs. It also solves open instances for several problems from recent (2025) literature, generating new Covering Sequences, Johnson Clique Covers, Deletion Codes, and a Uniform Nested Steiner Quadruple System.

Abstract: Foundation models trained at scale exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors, learning new capabilities beyond their initial training objectives. We find such emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive vision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M, comprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse biological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various biological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We identify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At the inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns closely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the intra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better separated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide formal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and contrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties. Crucially, our results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant with larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding space.

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) models context dependencies by adapting part of the model's weights (referred to as fast weights) during inference. This fast weight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past tokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show effectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on modern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely low FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online minibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover, a small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the data, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or N-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the opposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to 1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk Test-Time Training (LaCT). It improves hardware utilization by orders of magnitude, and more importantly, facilitates scaling of nonlinear state size (up to 40% of model parameters), hence substantially improving state capacity, all without requiring cumbersome and error-prone kernel implementations. It also allows easy integration of sophisticated optimizers, e.g. Muon for online updates. We validate our approach across diverse modalities and tasks, including novel view synthesis with image set, language models, and auto-regressive video diffusion. Our approach can scale up to 14B-parameter AR video diffusion model on sequences up to 56K tokens. In our longest sequence experiment, we perform novel view synthesis with 1 million context length. We hope this work will inspire and accelerate new research in the field of long-context modeling and test-time training. Website: https://tianyuanzhang.com/projects/ttt-done-right

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains due to their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce Workforce, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks. Experimental results demonstrate Workforce achieves open-source state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like OpenAI's Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization and modular domain transfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next generation of general-purpose AI assistants.

arXiv:2505.23922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although long-video understanding demands that models capture hierarchical temporal information -- from clip (seconds) and shot (tens of seconds) to event (minutes) and story (hours) -- existing benchmarks either neglect this multi-scale design or scatter scale-specific questions across different videos, preventing direct comparison of model performance across timescales on the same content. To address this, we introduce ScaleLong, the first benchmark to disentangle these factors by embedding questions targeting four hierarchical timescales -- clip (seconds), shot (tens of seconds), event (minutes), and story (hours) -- all within the same video content. This within-content multi-timescale questioning design enables direct comparison of model performance across timescales on identical videos. ScaleLong features 269 long videos (avg.\ 86\,min) from 5 main categories and 36 sub-categories, with 4--8 carefully designed questions, including at least one question for each timescale. Evaluating 23 MLLMs reveals a U-shaped performance curve, with higher accuracy at the shortest and longest timescales and a dip at intermediate levels. Furthermore, ablation studies show that increased visual token capacity consistently enhances reasoning across all timescales. ScaleLong offers a fine-grained, multi-timescale benchmark for advancing MLLM capabilities in long-video understanding. The code and dataset are available https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/ScaleLong.

<title>Information Structure in Mappings: An Approach to Learning, Representation, and Generalisation</title>

arXiv:2505.23960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of large large-scale neural networks, we still lack unified notation for thinking about and describing their representational spaces. We lack methods to reliably describe how their representations are structured, how that structure emerges over training, and what kinds of structures are desirable. This thesis introduces quantitative methods for identifying systematic structure in a mapping between spaces, and leverages them to understand how deep-learning models learn to represent information, what representational structures drive generalisation, and how design decisions condition the structures that emerge. To do this I identify structural primitives present in a mapping, along with information theoretic quantifications of each. These allow us to analyse learning, structure, and generalisation across multi-agent reinforcement learning models, sequence-to-sequence models trained on a single task, and Large Language Models. I also introduce a novel, performant, approach to estimating the entropy of vector space, that allows this analysis to be applied to models ranging in size from 1 million to 12 billion parameters.
  The experiments here work to shed light on how large-scale distributed models of cognition learn, while allowing us to draw parallels between those systems and their human analogs. They show how the structures of language and the constraints that give rise to them in many ways parallel the kinds of structures that drive performance of contemporary neural networks.

Abstract: In real-world drug design, molecule optimization requires selectively improving multiple molecular properties up to pharmaceutically relevant levels, while maintaining others that already meet such criteria. However, existing computational approaches and instruction-tuned LLMs fail to capture such nuanced property-specific objectives, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce C-MuMOInstruct, the first instruction-tuning dataset focused on multi-property optimization with explicit, property-specific objectives. Leveraging C-MuMOInstruct, we develop GeLLMO-Cs, a series of instruction-tuned LLMs that can perform targeted property-specific optimization. Our experiments across 5 in-distribution and 5 out-of-distribution tasks show that GeLLMO-Cs consistently outperform strong baselines, achieving up to 126% higher success rate. Notably, GeLLMO-Cs exhibit impressive 0-shot generalization to novel optimization tasks and unseen instructions. This offers a step toward a foundational LLM to support realistic, diverse optimizations with property-specific objectives. C-MuMOInstruct and code are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/GeLLMO-C.

Abstract: Crowd work platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific are vital for research, yet workers' growing use of generative AI tools poses challenges. Researchers face compromised data validity as AI responses replace authentic human behavior, while workers risk diminished roles as AI automates tasks. To address this, we propose a hybrid framework using digital twins, personalized AI models that emulate workers' behaviors and preferences while keeping humans in the loop. We evaluate our system with an experiment (n=88 crowd workers) and in-depth interviews with crowd workers (n=5) and social science researchers (n=4). Our results suggest that digital twins may enhance productivity and reduce decision fatigue while maintaining response quality. Both researchers and workers emphasized the importance of transparency, ethical data use, and worker agency. By automating repetitive tasks and preserving human engagement for nuanced ones, digital twins may help balance scalability with authenticity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o can handle a wide range of complex tasks with the right prompt. As per token costs are reduced, the advantages of fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for real-world applications -- faster inference, lower costs -- may no longer be clear. In this work, we present evidence that, for domain-specific tasks that require structured outputs, SLMs still have a quality advantage. We compare fine-tuning an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results, fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic error analysis to reveal model limitations.

Abstract: With more than 11 times as many pageviews as the next, English Wikipedia dominates global knowledge access relative to other language editions. Readers are prone to assuming English Wikipedia as a superset of all language editions, leading many to prefer it even when their primary language is not English. Other language editions, however, comprise complementary facts rooted in their respective cultures and media environments, which are marginalized in English Wikipedia. While Wikipedia's user interface enables switching between language editions through its Interlanguage Link (ILL) system, it does not reveal to readers that other language editions contain valuable, complementary information. We present WikiGap, a system that surfaces complementary facts sourced from other Wikipedias within the English Wikipedia interface. Specifically, by combining a recent multilingual information-gap discovery method with a user-centered design, WikiGap enables access to complementary information from French, Russian, and Chinese Wikipedia. In a mixed-methods study (n=21), WikiGap significantly improved fact-finding accuracy, reduced task time, and received a 32-point higher usability score relative to Wikipedia's current ILL-based navigation system. Participants reported increased awareness of the availability of complementary information in non-English editions and reconsidered the completeness of English Wikipedia. WikiGap thus paves the way for improved epistemic equity across language editions.

Abstract: Multilingual speech processing with self-supervised or supervised pre-trained Speech Foundation Models (SFM) has achieved strong performance on tasks like Language Identification (LID) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, these models struggle with limited resources during fine-tuning. This paper enhances multilingual LID and ASR on ML-SUPERB 2.0 by exploring multiple strategies for adapting SFMs, including frozen upstream training, partial fine-tuning, and low-rank adaptation. Furthermore, we employ data augmentation to mitigate performance gaps in few-shot settings and introduce LID Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for regularization. Our approach achieves a 14% relative improvement in LID accuracy and a 30% relative reduction in ASR CER over the baseline on ML-SUPERB 2.0, securing second place in the Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge.

<title>Reasoning Can Hurt the Inductive Abilities of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across domains, yet their ability to perform inductive reasoning - inferring latent rules from sparse examples - remains limited. It is often assumed that chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, as used in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), enhances such reasoning. We investigate this assumption with creating four controlled, diagnostic game-based tasks - chess, Texas Hold'em, dice games, and blackjack - with hidden human-defined rules. We find that CoT reasoning can degrade inductive performance, with LRMs often underperforming their non-reasoning counterparts.
  To explain this, we present a theoretical framework that reveals how reasoning steps can amplify error through three failure modes: incorrect sub-task decomposition, incorrect sub-task solving, and incorrect final answer summarization. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we introduce structured interventions that adapt CoT generation according to our identified failure types. These interventions improve inductive accuracy without retraining. Our findings suggest that effective (CoT) reasoning depends not only on taking more steps but also on ensuring those steps are well-structured.

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) are susceptible to two distinct vulnerabilities: hallucinations and jailbreak attacks. While typically studied in isolation, we observe that defenses targeting one often affect the other, hinting at a deeper connection.
  We propose a unified theoretical framework that models jailbreaks as token-level optimization and hallucinations as attention-level optimization. Within this framework, we establish two key propositions: (1) \textit{Similar Loss Convergence} - the loss functions for both vulnerabilities converge similarly when optimizing for target-specific outputs; and (2) \textit{Gradient Consistency in Attention Redistribution} - both exhibit consistent gradient behavior driven by shared attention dynamics.
  We validate these propositions empirically on LLaVA-1.5 and MiniGPT-4, showing consistent optimization trends and aligned gradients. Leveraging this connection, we demonstrate that mitigation techniques for hallucinations can reduce jailbreak success rates, and vice versa. Our findings reveal a shared failure mode in LFMs and suggest that robustness strategies should jointly address both vulnerabilities.

Abstract: While multi-agent LLM systems show strong capabilities in various domains, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial and low-performing agents. To resolve this issue, in this paper, we introduce a general and adversary-resistant multi-agent LLM framework based on credibility scoring. We model the collaborative query-answering process as an iterative game, where the agents communicate and contribute to a final system output. Our system associates a credibility score that is used when aggregating the team outputs. The credibility scores are learned gradually based on the past contributions of each agent in query answering. Our experiments across multiple tasks and settings demonstrate our system's effectiveness in mitigating adversarial influence and enhancing the resilience of multi-agent cooperation, even in the adversary-majority settings.

Abstract: Human-AI conversation frequently relies on quoting earlier text-"check it with the formula I just highlighted"-yet today's large language models (LLMs) lack an explicit mechanism for locating and exploiting such spans. We formalise the challenge as span-conditioned generation, decomposing each turn into the dialogue history, a set of token-offset quotation spans, and an intent utterance. Building on this abstraction, we introduce a quotation-centric data pipeline that automatically synthesises task-specific dialogues, verifies answer correctness through multi-stage consistency checks, and yields both a heterogeneous training corpus and the first benchmark covering five representative scenarios. To meet the benchmark's zero-overhead and parameter-efficiency requirements, we propose QuAda, a lightweight training-based method that attaches two bottleneck projections to every attention head, dynamically amplifying or suppressing attention to quoted spans at inference time while leaving the prompt unchanged and updating < 2.8% of backbone weights. Experiments across models show that QuAda is suitable for all scenarios and generalises to unseen topics, offering an effective, plug-and-play solution for quotation-aware dialogue.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the inference operations of several open-weight large language models (LLMs) can be mapped to an exactly equivalent linear system for an input sequence without modifying the model weights or altering output predictions. Extending techniques from image diffusion models that exhibit local or piecewise linearity, we strategically alter the gradient computation with respect to a given input sequence for a next-token prediction such that the Jacobian of the model nearly exactly reproduces the forward prediction with a linear system. We demonstrate this approach across models (Llama 3, Gemma 3, Qwen 3, Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4) and show through the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian that these LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where many of the largest singular vectors decode to concepts related to the most-likely output token. This approach also allows us to examine the operation of each successive layer (and its attention and MLP components) as nearly-exact linear systems and observe the emergence of semantic concepts. Despite their expressive power and global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through nearly-exact locally linear decompositions that provide insights into their internal representations and reveal interpretable semantic structures in the next-token prediction process.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have showcased significant advancements in code generation. However, most evaluation benchmarks are primarily oriented towards Python, making it difficult to evaluate other programming languages, such as Swift, with high quality. By examining widely established multilingual benchmarks like HumanEval-XL and MultiPL-E, we identified critical issues specific to their Swift components, making them insufficient or even irrelevant for assessing LLM coding capabilities on Swift. Unlike these existing approaches, which prioritize rapid scaling and generalization by automatically translating Python-centric benchmarks with LLMs, we adopt a quality-over-quantity methodology. We present SwiftEval, the first Swift-oriented benchmark consisting of 28 carefully hand-crafted problems, and evaluate 44 popular Code LLMs on it. Our results show significant LLM scores drop for problems requiring language-specific features, most noticeable in the models of smaller sizes.

Abstract: Classifying geospatial imagery remains a major bottleneck for applications such as disaster response and land-use monitoring-particularly in regions where annotated data is scarce or unavailable. Existing tools (e.g., RS-CLIP) that claim zero-shot classification capabilities for satellite imagery nonetheless rely on task-specific pretraining and adaptation to reach competitive performance. We introduce GeoVision Labeler (GVL), a strictly zero-shot classification framework: a vision Large Language Model (vLLM) generates rich, human-readable image descriptions, which are then mapped to user-defined classes by a conventional Large Language Model (LLM). This modular, and interpretable pipeline enables flexible image classification for a large range of use cases. We evaluated GVL across three benchmarks-SpaceNet v7, UC Merced, and RESISC45. It achieves up to 93.2% zero-shot accuracy on the binary Buildings vs. No Buildings task on SpaceNet v7. For complex multi-class classification tasks (UC Merced, RESISC45), we implemented a recursive LLM-driven clustering to form meta-classes at successive depths, followed by hierarchical classification-first resolving coarse groups, then finer distinctions-to deliver competitive zero-shot performance. GVL is open-sourced at https://github.com/microsoft/geo-vision-labeler to catalyze adoption in real-world geospatial workflows.

Abstract: Understanding what emotions images evoke in their viewers is a foundational goal in human-centric visual computing. While recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for visual emotion analysis (VEA), several key challenges remain unresolved. Emotional cues in images are often abstract, overlapping, and entangled, making them difficult to model and interpret. Moreover, VLMs struggle to align these complex visual patterns with emotional semantics due to limited supervision and sparse emotional grounding. Finally, existing approaches lack structured affective knowledge to resolve ambiguity and ensure consistent emotional reasoning across diverse visual domains.
  To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{K-EVER\textsuperscript{2}}, a knowledge-enhanced framework for emotion reasoning and retrieval. Our approach introduces a semantically structured formulation of visual emotion cues and integrates external affective knowledge through multimodal alignment. Without relying on handcrafted labels or direct emotion supervision, K-EVER\textsuperscript{2} achieves robust and interpretable emotion predictions across heterogeneous image types.
  We validate our framework on three representative benchmarks, Emotion6, EmoSet, and M-Disaster, covering social media imagery, human-centric scenes, and disaster contexts. K-EVER\textsuperscript{2} consistently outperforms strong CNN and VLM baselines, achieving up to a \textbf{19\% accuracy gain} for specific emotions and a \textbf{12.3\% average accuracy gain} across all emotion categories. Our results demonstrate a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing emotional understanding of visual content.

<title>Breaking the Gold Standard: Extracting Forgotten Data under Exact Unlearning in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models are typically trained on datasets collected from the web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information. To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data -- is widely regarded the gold standard, believed to be robust against privacy-related attacks. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by introducing a novel data extraction attack that compromises even exact unlearning. Our method leverages both the pre- and post-unlearning models: by guiding the post-unlearning model using signals from the pre-unlearning model, we uncover patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase the risk of privacy leakage, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) results in complex systems with numerous hyperparameters that directly affect performance. While such systems are increasingly common in retrieval-augmented generation, the role of systematic hyperparameter optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we study this problem in the context of Cognee, a modular framework for end-to-end KG construction and retrieval. Using three multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotPotQA, TwoWikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue) we optimize parameters related to chunking, graph construction, retrieval, and prompting. Each configuration is scored using established metrics (exact match, F1, and DeepEval's LLM-based correctness metric). Our results demonstrate that meaningful gains can be achieved through targeted tuning. While the gains are consistent, they are not uniform, with performance varying across datasets and metrics. This variability highlights both the value of tuning and the limitations of standard evaluation measures. While demonstrating the immediate potential of hyperparameter tuning, we argue that future progress will depend not only on architectural advances but also on clearer frameworks for optimization and evaluation in complex, modular systems.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation, further amplified by recent advances in generative AI, poses significant threats to society, impacting public opinion, democratic stability, and national security. Understanding and proactively assessing these threats requires exploring methodologies that enable structured and scalable misinformation generation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) as structured semantic resources to systematically generate fake triplets. By analyzing the structural properties of KGs, such as the distance between entities and their predicates, we identify plausibly false relationships. These triplets are then used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating misinformation statements with varying degrees of credibility. By utilizing structured semantic relationships, our deterministic approach produces misinformation inherently challenging for humans to detect, drawing exclusively upon publicly available KGs (e.g., WikiGraphs).
  Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of LLMs in distinguishing between genuine and artificially generated misinformation. Our analysis highlights significant limitations in current LLM-based detection methods, underscoring the necessity for enhanced detection strategies and a deeper exploration of inherent biases in generative models.

Abstract: We introduce AMIA, a lightweight, inference-only defense for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that (1) Automatically Masks a small set of text-irrelevant image patches to disrupt adversarial perturbations, and (2) conducts joint Intention Analysis to uncover and mitigate hidden harmful intents before response generation. Without any retraining, AMIA improves defense success rates across diverse LVLMs and jailbreak benchmarks from an average of 52.4% to 81.7%, preserves general utility with only a 2% average accuracy drop, and incurs only modest inference overhead. Ablation confirms both masking and intention analysis are essential for a robust safety-utility trade-off.

Abstract: Controlling multiple behavioral attributes in large language models (LLMs) at inference time is a challenging problem due to interference between attributes and the limitations of linear steering methods, which assume additive behavior in activation space and require per-attribute tuning. We introduce K-Steering, a unified and flexible approach that trains a single non-linear multi-label classifier on hidden activations and computes intervention directions via gradients at inference time. This avoids linearity assumptions, removes the need for storing and tuning separate attribute vectors, and allows dynamic composition of behaviors without retraining. To evaluate our method, we propose two new benchmarks, ToneBank and DebateMix, targeting compositional behavioral control. Empirical results across 3 model families, validated by both activation-based classifiers and LLM-based judges, demonstrate that K-Steering outperforms strong baselines in accurately steering multiple behaviors.

Abstract: Automating primary stress identification has been an active research field due to the role of stress in encoding meaning and aiding speech comprehension. Previous studies relied mainly on traditional acoustic features and English datasets. In this paper, we investigate the approach of fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model with an audio frame classification head. Our experiments use a new Croatian training dataset, with test sets in Croatian, Serbian, the Chakavian dialect, and Slovenian. By comparing an SVM classifier using traditional acoustic features with the fine-tuned speech transformer, we demonstrate the transformer's superiority across the board, achieving near-perfect results for Croatian and Serbian, with a 10-point performance drop for the more distant Chakavian and Slovenian. Finally, we show that only a few hundred multi-syllabic training words suffice for strong performance. We release our datasets and model under permissive licenses.

<title>Causal-aware Large Language Models: Enhancing Decision-Making Through Learning, Adapting and Acting</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in decision-making due to the vast amount of knowledge stored within the models. However, these pre-trained models are prone to lack reasoning abilities and are difficult to adapt to new environments, further hindering their application to complex real-world tasks. To address these challenges, inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Causal-aware LLMs, which integrate the structural causal model (SCM) into the decision-making process to model, update, and utilize structured knowledge of the environment in a ``learning-adapting-acting" paradigm. Specifically, in the learning stage, we first utilize an LLM to extract the environment-specific causal entities and their causal relations to initialize a structured causal model of the environment. Subsequently,in the adapting stage, we update the structured causal model through external feedback about the environment, via an idea of causal intervention. Finally, in the acting stage, Causal-aware LLMs exploit structured causal knowledge for more efficient policy-making through the reinforcement learning agent. The above processes are performed iteratively to learn causal knowledge, ultimately enabling the causal-aware LLMs to achieve a more accurate understanding of the environment and make more efficient decisions. Experimental results across 22 diverse tasks within the open-world game ``Crafter" validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce CoRet, a dense retrieval model designed for code-editing tasks that integrates code semantics, repository structure, and call graph dependencies. The model focuses on retrieving relevant portions of a code repository based on natural language queries such as requests to implement new features or fix bugs. These retrieved code chunks can then be presented to a user or to a second code-editing model or agent. To train CoRet, we propose a loss function explicitly designed for repository-level retrieval. On SWE-bench and Long Code Arena's bug localisation datasets, we show that our model substantially improves retrieval recall by at least 15 percentage points over existing models, and ablate the design choices to show their importance in achieving these results.

Abstract: Turn-taking in dialogue follows universal constraints but also varies significantly. This study examines how demographic (sex, age, education) and individual factors shape turn-taking using a large dataset of US English conversations (Fisher). We analyze Transition Floor Offset (TFO) and find notable interspeaker variation. Sex and age have small but significant effects female speakers and older individuals exhibit slightly shorter offsets - while education shows no effect. Lighter topics correlate with shorter TFOs. However, individual differences have a greater impact, driven by a strong idiosyncratic and an even stronger "dyadosyncratic" component - speakers in a dyad resemble each other more than they resemble themselves in different dyads. This suggests that the dyadic relationship and joint activity are the strongest determinants of TFO, outweighing demographic influences.

Abstract: Low-rank gradient-based optimization methods have significantly improved memory efficiency during the training of large language models (LLMs), enabling operations within constrained hardware without sacrificing performance. However, these methods primarily emphasize memory savings, often overlooking potential acceleration in convergence due to their reliance on standard isotropic steepest descent techniques, which can perform suboptimally in the highly anisotropic landscapes typical of deep networks, particularly LLMs. In this paper, we propose SUMO (Subspace-Aware Moment-Orthogonalization), an optimizer that employs exact singular value decomposition (SVD) for moment orthogonalization within a dynamically adapted low-dimensional subspace, enabling norm-inducing steepest descent optimization steps. By explicitly aligning optimization steps with the spectral characteristics of the loss landscape, SUMO effectively mitigates approximation errors associated with commonly used methods like Newton-Schulz orthogonalization approximation. We theoretically establish an upper bound on these approximation errors, proving their dependence on the condition numbers of moments, conditions we analytically demonstrate are encountered during LLM training. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically illustrate that exact orthogonalization via SVD substantially improves convergence rates while reducing overall complexity. Empirical evaluations confirm that SUMO accelerates convergence, enhances stability, improves performance, and reduces memory requirements by up to 20% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

It provides over 100 data generators and verifiers spanning multiple domains including algebra, arithmetic, computation, cognition, geometry, graph theory, logic, and various common games. Its key innovation is the ability to generate virtually infinite training data with adjustable complexity, unlike most previous reasoning datasets, which are typically fixed. This procedural generation approach allows for continuous evaluation across varying difficulty levels. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of RG in both evaluating and reinforcement learning of reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have enabled models to produce high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, these models often struggle with complex instructions involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships. Existing benchmarks for evaluating T2I models primarily focus on general text-image alignment and fail to capture the nuanced requirements of complex, multi-faceted prompts. Given this gap, we introduce LongBench-T2I, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models under complex instructions. LongBench-T2I consists of 500 intricately designed prompts spanning nine diverse visual evaluation dimensions, enabling a thorough assessment of a model's ability to follow complex instructions. Beyond benchmarking, we propose an agent framework (Plan2Gen) that facilitates complex instruction-driven image generation without requiring additional model training. This framework integrates seamlessly with existing T2I models, using large language models to interpret and decompose complex prompts, thereby guiding the generation process more effectively. As existing evaluation metrics, such as CLIPScore, fail to adequately capture the nuances of complex instructions, we introduce an evaluation toolkit that automates the quality assessment of generated images using a set of multi-dimensional metrics. The data and code are released at https://github.com/yczhou001/LongBench-T2I.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics. Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise, principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.

Abstract: This paper reveals that many state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) lack hierarchical knowledge about our visual world, unaware of even well-established biology taxonomies. This shortcoming makes LLMs a bottleneck for vision LLMs' hierarchical visual understanding (e.g., recognizing Anemone Fish but not Vertebrate). We arrive at these findings using about one million four-choice visual question answering (VQA) tasks constructed from six taxonomies and four image datasets. Interestingly, finetuning a vision LLM using our VQA tasks reaffirms LLMs' bottleneck effect to some extent because the VQA tasks improve the LLM's hierarchical consistency more than the vision LLM's. We conjecture that one cannot make vision LLMs understand visual concepts fully hierarchical until LLMs possess corresponding taxonomy knowledge.

Abstract: Training data mixtures greatly impact the generalization performance of large language models. Existing domain reweighting methods often rely on costly weight computations and require retraining when new data is introduced. To this end, we introduce a flexible and efficient data mixing framework, Chameleon, that employs leverage scores to quantify domain importance within a learned embedding space. We first construct a domain affinity matrix over domain embeddings. The induced leverage scores determine a mixture that upweights domains sharing common representations in embedding space. This formulation allows direct transfer to new data by computing the new domain embeddings. In experiments, we demonstrate improvements over three key scenarios: (i) our computed weights improve performance on pretraining domains with a fraction of the compute of existing methods; (ii) Chameleon can adapt to data changes without proxy retraining, boosting few-shot reasoning accuracies when transferred to new data; (iii) our method enables efficient domain reweighting in finetuning, consistently improving test perplexity on all finetuning domains over uniform mixture. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/Chameleon.

Abstract: Reward modeling is a key step in building safe foundation models when applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align Large Language Models (LLMs). However, reward modeling based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumes a global reward function, failing to capture the inherently diverse and heterogeneous human preferences. Hence, such oversimplification limits LLMs from supporting personalization and pluralistic alignment. Theoretically, we show that when human preferences follow a mixture distribution of diverse subgroups, a single BT model has an irreducible error. While existing solutions, such as multi-objective learning with fine-grained annotations, help address this issue, they are costly and constrained by predefined attributes, failing to fully capture the richness of human values. In this work, we introduce MiCRo, a two-stage framework that enhances personalized preference learning by leveraging large-scale binary preference datasets without requiring explicit fine-grained annotations. In the first stage, MiCRo introduces context-aware mixture modeling approach to capture diverse human preferences. In the second stage, MiCRo integrates an online routing strategy that dynamically adapts mixture weights based on specific context to resolve ambiguity, allowing for efficient and scalable preference adaptation with minimal additional supervision. Experiments on multiple preference datasets demonstrate that MiCRo effectively captures diverse human preferences and significantly improves downstream personalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in model distillation demonstrate that data from advanced reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1) can effectively transfer complex reasoning abilities to smaller, efficient student models. However, standard practices employ rejection sampling, discarding incorrect reasoning examples -- valuable, yet often underutilized data. This paper addresses the critical question: How can both positive and negative distilled reasoning traces be effectively leveraged to maximize LLM reasoning performance in an offline setting? To this end, We propose Reinforcement Distillation (REDI), a two-stage framework. Stage 1 learns from positive traces via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Stage 2 further refines the model using both positive and negative traces through our proposed REDI objective. This novel objective is a simple, reference-free loss function that outperforms established methods like DPO and SimPO in this distillation context. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate REDI's superiority over baseline Rejection Sampling SFT or SFT combined with DPO/SimPO on mathematical reasoning tasks. Notably, the Qwen-REDI-1.5B model, post-trained on just 131k positive and negative examples from the open Open-R1 dataset, achieves an 83.1% score on MATH-500 (pass@1). Its performance matches or surpasses that of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (a model post-trained on 800k proprietary data) across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B models post-trained offline with openly available data.

Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling text properties by adding a learned bias to language model activations at inference time. So far, steering vectors have predominantly been evaluated in multiple-choice settings, while their effectiveness in free-form generation tasks remains understudied. Moving "Beyond Multiple Choice," we thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of steering vectors in adaptively controlling topical focus, sentiment, toxicity, and readability in abstractive summaries of the NEWTS dataset. We find that steering effectively controls the targeted summary properties, but high steering strengths consistently degrade both intrinsic and extrinsic text quality. Compared to steering, prompting offers weaker control, while preserving text quality. Combining steering and prompting yields the strongest control over text properties and offers the most favorable efficacy-quality trade-off at moderate steering strengths. Our results underscore the practical trade-off between control strength and text quality preservation when applying steering vectors to free-form generation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers. Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such, training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets, highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture. Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have pushed the boundaries of the visual reasoning capabilities in large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, training LVLMs with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is computationally expensive, posing a significant challenge to scaling model size. In this work, we propose ProxyThinker, an inference-time technique that enables large models to inherit the visual reasoning capabilities from small, slow-thinking visual reasoners without any training. By subtracting the output distributions of base models from those of RFT reasoners, ProxyThinker modifies the decoding dynamics and successfully elicits the slow-thinking reasoning demonstrated by the emerged sophisticated behaviors such as self-verification and self-correction. ProxyThinker consistently boosts performance on challenging visual benchmarks on spatial, mathematical, and multi-disciplinary reasoning, enabling untuned base models to compete with the performance of their full-scale RFT counterparts. Furthermore, our implementation efficiently coordinates multiple language models with parallelism techniques and achieves up to 38 $\times$ faster inference compared to previous decoding-time methods, paving the way for the practical deployment of ProxyThinker. Code is available at https://github.com/MrZilinXiao/ProxyThinker.

Abstract: Although chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) have driven breakthroughs in NLP, their integration into generative vision models remains underexplored. We introduce ReasonGen-R1, a two-stage framework that first imbues an autoregressive image generator with explicit text-based "thinking" skills via supervised fine-tuning on a newly generated reasoning dataset of written rationales, and then refines its outputs using Group Relative Policy Optimization. To enable the model to reason through text before generating images, We automatically generate and release a corpus of model crafted rationales paired with visual prompts, enabling controlled planning of object layouts, styles, and scene compositions. Our GRPO algorithm uses reward signals from a pretrained vision language model to assess overall visual quality, optimizing the policy in each update. Evaluations on GenEval, DPG, and the T2I benchmark demonstrate that ReasonGen-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines and prior state-of-the-art models. More: aka.ms/reasongen.

Abstract: Deep reasoning is fundamental for solving complex tasks, especially in vision-centric scenarios that demand sequential, multimodal understanding. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate agents with fully synthetic, single-turn queries, limited visual modalities, and lack a framework to assess reasoning quality over multiple steps as required in real-world settings. To address this, we introduce Agent-X, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating vision-centric agents multi-step and deep reasoning capabilities in real-world, multimodal settings. Agent- X features 828 agentic tasks with authentic visual contexts, including images, multi-image comparisons, videos, and instructional text. These tasks span six major agentic environments: general visual reasoning, web browsing, security and surveillance, autonomous driving, sports, and math reasoning. Our benchmark requires agents to integrate tool use with explicit, stepwise decision-making in these diverse settings. In addition, we propose a fine-grained, step-level evaluation framework that assesses the correctness and logical coherence of each reasoning step and the effectiveness of tool usage throughout the task. Our results reveal that even the best-performing models, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families, struggle to solve multi-step vision tasks, achieving less than 50% full-chain success. These findings highlight key bottlenecks in current LMM reasoning and tool-use capabilities and identify future research directions in vision-centric agentic reasoning models.

Abstract: CAPTCHAs have been a critical bottleneck for deploying web agents in real-world applications, often blocking them from completing end-to-end automation tasks. While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated impressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle interactive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested. To address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based benchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning and interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic CAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225 CAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth, which quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each puzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect scores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates at most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance, 93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing the limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more robust multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: The generation of toxic content by large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge for the safe deployment of language technology. We propose a novel framework for implicit knowledge editing and controlled text generation by fine-tuning LLMs with a prototype-based contrastive perplexity objective. Central to our method is the construction of hard negatives - toxic outputs that are generated through adversarial paraphrasing to be semantically similar and model probability to their non-toxic counterparts. By training on these challenging and realistic pairs, our approach ensures robust and stable contrastive optimization. Experimental results in the domain of detoxification demonstrate that our method significantly reduces toxic generation while maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks such as commonsense reasoning and reading comprehension. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of exploiting hard negatives for attribute-aware fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing trend of utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) to evaluate the quality of other LLMs. Many studies have fine-tuned judge models based on open-source LLMs for evaluation. While the fine-tuned judge models are claimed to achieve comparable evaluation capability with GPT-4, in this work, we conduct an empirical study of LLM-as-a-Judge. Our findings indicate that although the fine-tuned judge models achieve high performance on in-domain test sets, even surpassing GPT-4, they underperform GPT-4 across several dimensions, including generalizability, fairness and adaptability. We also reveal that the fine-tuned judge model inherently operates as a task-specific classifier, consequently imposing the limitations.

<title>Efficient Universal Goal Hijacking with Semantics-guided Prompt Organization</title>

Abstract: Universal goal hijacking is a kind of prompt injection attack that forces LLMs to return a target malicious response for arbitrary normal user prompts. The previous methods achieve high attack performance while being too cumbersome and time-consuming. Also, they have concentrated solely on optimization algorithms, overlooking the crucial role of the prompt. To this end, we propose a method called POUGH that incorporates an efficient optimization algorithm and two semantics-guided prompt organization strategies. Specifically, our method starts with a sampling strategy to select representative prompts from a candidate pool, followed by a ranking strategy that prioritizes them. Given the sequentially ranked prompts, our method employs an iterative optimization algorithm to generate a fixed suffix that can concatenate to arbitrary user prompts for universal goal hijacking. Experiments conducted on four popular LLMs and ten types of target responses verified the effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but face challenges from hallucinations, which typically arise from insufficient knowledge or context. While instructing LLMs to acknowledge knowledge limitations by responding with "I don't know" appears promising, we find that models consistently struggle with admitting knowledge gaps. This challenge may originate from current instruction datasets that emphasise answer generation over knowledge boundary awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Uncertainty-and-Sensitivity-Aware Tuning (US-Tuning), a novel two-stage approach for contextual question answering (QA). The first stage enhances LLMs' ability to recognise their knowledge boundaries, while the second stage reinforces instruction adherence through carefully designed causal prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that US-Tuning not only significantly reduces incorrect answers in contextual QA but also improves models' faithfulness to their parametric knowledge, mitigating hallucinations in general QA tasks. Our fine-tuned Llama2-7B model achieves up to a 34.7% improvement in handling out-of-knowledge questions and outperforms GPT-4 by 4.2% in overall performance.

Abstract: To create culturally inclusive vision-language models (VLMs), developing a benchmark that tests their ability to address culturally relevant questions is essential. Existing approaches typically rely on human annotators, making the process labor-intensive and creating a cognitive burden in generating diverse questions. To address this, we propose a semi-automated framework for constructing cultural VLM benchmarks, specifically targeting multiple-choice QA. This framework combines human-VLM collaboration, where VLMs generate questions based on guidelines, a small set of annotated examples, and relevant knowledge, followed by a verification process by native speakers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through the creation of \texttt{K-Viscuit}, a dataset focused on Korean culture. Our experiments on this dataset reveal that open-source models lag behind proprietary ones in understanding Korean culture, highlighting key areas for improvement. We also present a series of further analyses, including human evaluation, augmenting VLMs with external knowledge, and the evaluation beyond multiple-choice QA. Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ddehun/k-viscuit.

Abstract: Natural Question Answering (QA) datasets play a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their effectiveness in real-world applications. Despite the numerous QA datasets that have been developed and some work has been done in parallel, there is a notable lack of a framework and large scale region-specific datasets queried by native users in their own languages. This gap hinders the effective benchmarking and the development of fine-tuned models for regional and cultural specificities. In this study, we propose a scalable, language-independent framework, NativQA, to seamlessly construct culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages, for LLM evaluation and tuning. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework by designing a multilingual natural QA dataset, MultiNativQA, consisting of ~64k manually annotated QA pairs in seven languages, ranging from high to extremely low resource, based on queries from native speakers from 9 regions covering 18 topics. We benchmark open- and closed-source LLMs with the MultiNativQA dataset. We made the MultiNativQA dataset(https://huggingface.co/datasets/QCRI/MultiNativQA), and other experimental scripts(https://gitlab.com/nativqa/multinativqa) publicly available for the community.

Abstract: Multilingual sentence encoders (MSEs) are commonly obtained by training multilingual language models to map sentences from different languages into a shared semantic space. As such, they are subject to curse of multilinguality, a loss of monolingual representational accuracy due to parameter sharing. Another limitation of MSEs is the trade-off between different task performance: cross-lingual alignment training distorts the optimal monolingual structure of semantic spaces of individual languages, harming the utility of sentence embeddings in monolingual tasks; cross-lingual tasks, such as cross-lingual semantic similarity and zero-shot transfer for sentence classification, may also require conflicting cross-lingual alignment strategies. In this work, we address both issues by means of modular training of sentence encoders. We first train language-specific monolingual modules to mitigate negative interference between languages (i.e., the curse). We then align all non-English sentence embeddings to the English by training cross-lingual alignment adapters, preventing interference with monolingual specialization from the first step. We train the cross-lingual adapters with two different types of data to resolve the conflicting requirements of different cross-lingual tasks. Monolingual and cross-lingual results on semantic text similarity and relatedness, bitext mining and sentence classification show that our modular solution achieves better and more balanced performance across all the tasks compared to full-parameter training of monolithic multilingual sentence encoders, especially benefiting low-resource languages.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate coherent text, they often struggle to recognise user intent behind queries. In contrast, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models interpret the purpose and key information of user input for responsive interactions. Existing NLU models typically map utterances to a dual-level semantic frame, involving sentence-level intent (SI) and word-level slot (WS) labels. However, real-life conversations primarily consist of multi-turn dialogues, requiring the interpretation of complex and extended exchanges. Researchers encounter challenges in addressing all facets of multi-turn dialogue using a unified NLU model. This paper introduces MIDAS, a novel approach leveraging multi-level intent, domain, and slot knowledge distillation for multi-turn NLU. We construct distinct teachers for SI detection, WS filling, and conversation-level domain (CD) classification, each fine-tuned for specific knowledge. A multi-teacher loss is proposed to facilitate the integration of these teachers, guiding a student model in multi-turn dialogue tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of our model in improving multi-turn conversation understanding, showcasing the potential for advancements in NLU through multi-level dialogue knowledge distillation. Our implementation is open-sourced on https://github.com/adlnlp/Midas.

Abstract: Relying on human experts to evaluate CEFR speaking assessments in an e-learning environment creates scalability challenges, as it limits how quickly and widely assessments can be conducted. We aim to automate the evaluation of CEFR B2 English speaking assessments in e-learning environments from conversation transcripts. First, we evaluate the capability of leading open source and commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) to score a candidate's performance across various criteria in the CEFR B2 speaking exam in both global and India-specific contexts. Next, we create a new expert-validated, CEFR-aligned synthetic conversational dataset with transcripts that are rated at different assessment scores. In addition, new instruction-tuned datasets are developed from the English Vocabulary Profile (up to CEFR B2 level) and the CEFR-SP WikiAuto datasets. Finally, using these new datasets, we perform parameter efficient instruction tuning of Mistral Instruct 7B v0.2 to develop a family of models called EvalYaks. Four models in this family are for assessing the four sections of the CEFR B2 speaking exam, one for identifying the CEFR level of vocabulary and generating level-specific vocabulary, and another for detecting the CEFR level of text and generating level-specific text. EvalYaks achieved an average acceptable accuracy of 96%, a degree of variation of 0.35 levels, and performed 3 times better than the next best model. This demonstrates that a 7B parameter LLM instruction tuned with high-quality CEFR-aligned assessment data can effectively evaluate and score CEFR B2 English speaking assessments, offering a promising solution for scalable, automated language proficiency evaluation.

Abstract: This study presents BanStereoSet, a dataset designed to evaluate stereotypical social biases in multilingual LLMs for the Bangla language. In an effort to extend the focus of bias research beyond English-centric datasets, we have localized the content from the StereoSet, IndiBias, and Kamruzzaman et. al.'s datasets, producing a resource tailored to capture biases prevalent within the Bangla-speaking community. Our BanStereoSet dataset consists of 1,194 sentences spanning 9 categories of bias: race, profession, gender, ageism, beauty, beauty in profession, region, caste, and religion. This dataset not only serves as a crucial tool for measuring bias in multilingual LLMs but also facilitates the exploration of stereotypical bias across different social categories, potentially guiding the development of more equitable language technologies in Bangladeshi contexts. Our analysis of several language models using this dataset indicates significant biases, reinforcing the necessity for culturally and linguistically adapted datasets to develop more equitable language technologies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) using in-context learning (ICL) excel in many tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, demonstration selection and ordering greatly impact ICL effectiveness. To address this, we propose DemoShapley and Beta-DemoShapley, inspired by Data Shapley and Beta Shapley, to assess the influence of individual demonstrations. DemoShapley captures how each example influences performance in different contexts, unlike other influence-based methods that rely on a fixed number of demonstrations. Beta-DemoShapley further enhances this framework by incorporating the Beta distribution, allowing users to assign higher weights to smaller cardinalities, which aligns with ICL's prompt length and computational constraints. Our findings show that the proposed algorithms improve model performance by selecting quality demonstrations, and enhancing generalization to out-of-distribution tasks. It also identifies noise-compromised data and promotes fairness in LLMs, protecting model performance and ensuring robustness across various scenarios.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, yet their ability to handle long documents is constrained by computational limitations. Traditional approaches, such as truncating inputs, sparse self-attention, and chunking, attempt to mitigate these issues, but they often lead to information loss and hinder the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce ChuLo, a novel chunk representation method for long document understanding that addresses these limitations. Our ChuLo groups input tokens using unsupervised keyphrase extraction, emphasizing semantically important keyphrase based chunks to retain core document content while reducing input length. This approach minimizes information loss and improves the efficiency of Transformer-based models. Preserving all tokens in long document understanding, especially token classification tasks, is important to ensure that fine-grained annotations, which depend on the entire sequence context, are not lost. We evaluate our method on multiple long document classification tasks and long document token classification tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. Our implementation is open-sourced on https://github.com/adlnlp/Chulo.

Abstract: Many court systems are overwhelmed all over the world, leading to huge backlogs of pending cases. Effective triage systems, like those in emergency rooms, could ensure proper prioritization of open cases, optimizing time and resource allocation in the court system. In this work, we introduce the Criticality Prediction dataset, a novel resource for evaluating case prioritization. Our dataset features a two-tier labeling system: (1) the binary LD-Label, identifying cases published as Leading Decisions (LD), and (2) the more granular Citation-Label, ranking cases by their citation frequency and recency, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation. Unlike existing approaches that rely on resource-intensive manual annotations, we algorithmically derive labels leading to a much larger dataset than otherwise possible. We evaluate several multilingual models, including both smaller fine-tuned models and large language models in a zero-shot setting. Our results show that the fine-tuned models consistently outperform their larger counterparts, thanks to our large training set. Our results highlight that for highly domain-specific tasks like ours, large training sets are still valuable.

Abstract: Evaluating Video Language Models (VLMs) is a challenging task. Due to its transparency, Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is widely used to measure the performance of these models through accuracy. However, existing MCQA benchmarks fail to capture the full reasoning capabilities of VLMs due to selection bias, when models disproportionately favor certain answer options based on positional patterns observed during training. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of several VLM architectures across major datasets designed to assess complex video-focused reasoning. We identify where the bias is most pronounced and demonstrate to what extent model responses reflect genuine understanding of video content and related questions, as opposed to reliance on arbitrary patterns or superficial cues, such as answer position. By decomposing the MCQA task and adapting fairness bias metrics to VLMs, we introduce a post-processing calibration technique BOLD to balance this bias. Our results show that reducing selection bias improves not only debiasing metrics but also overall model performance, including Accuracy and F1 Mean score. Our method, by suppressing "blind guessing", offers a more cost- and time-effective approach to mitigating selection bias compared to existing techniques. This study represents the first focused investigation of selection bias in video-to-text LLM-powered models.

Abstract: While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting approaches have significantly consolidated the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they still face limitations that require extensive human effort or have performance needs to be improved. Existing endeavors have focused on bridging these gaps; however, these approaches either hinge on external data and cannot completely eliminate manual effort, or they fall short in effectively directing LLMs to generate high-quality exemplary prompts. To address the said pitfalls, we propose a novel prompt approach for automatic reasoning named \textbf{LBS3}, inspired by curriculum learning which better reflects human learning habits. Specifically, LBS3 initially steers LLMs to recall easy-to-hard proxy queries that are pertinent to the target query. Following this, it invokes a progressive strategy that utilizes exemplary prompts stemmed from easy-proxy queries to direct LLMs in solving hard-proxy queries, enabling the high-quality of the proxy solutions. Finally, our extensive experiments in various reasoning-intensive tasks with varying open- and closed-source LLMs show that LBS3 achieves strongly competitive performance compared to the SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Developing robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for Arabic requires effective strategies to manage its diversity. Existing ASR systems mainly cover the modern standard Arabic (MSA) variety and few high-resource dialects, but fall short in coverage and generalization across the multitude of spoken variants. Code-switching with English and French is also common in different regions of the Arab world, which challenges the performance of monolingual Arabic models. In this work, we introduce a suite of ASR models optimized to effectively recognize multiple variants of spoken Arabic, including MSA, various dialects, and code-switching. We provide open-source pre-trained models that cover data from 17 Arabic-speaking countries, and fine-tuned MSA and dialectal ASR models that include at least 11 variants, as well as multi-lingual ASR models covering embedded languages in code-switched utterances. We evaluate ASR performance across these spoken varieties and demonstrate both coverage and performance gains compared to prior models.

Abstract: Text emotion detection constitutes a crucial foundation for advancing artificial intelligence from basic comprehension to the exploration of emotional reasoning. Most existing emotion detection datasets rely on manual annotations, which are associated with high costs, substantial subjectivity, and severe label imbalances. This is particularly evident in the inadequate annotation of micro-emotions and the absence of emotional intensity representation, which fail to capture the rich emotions embedded in sentences and adversely affect the quality of downstream task completion. By proposing an all-labels and training-set label regression method, we map label values to energy intensity levels, thereby fully leveraging the learning capabilities of machine models and the interdependencies among labels to uncover multiple emotions within samples. This led to the establishment of the Emotion Quantization Network (EQN) framework for micro-emotion detection and annotation. Using five commonly employed sentiment datasets, we conducted comparative experiments with various models, validating the broad applicability of our framework within NLP machine learning models. Based on the EQN framework, emotion detection and annotation are conducted on the GoEmotions dataset. A comprehensive comparison with the results from Google literature demonstrates that the EQN framework possesses a high capability for automatic detection and annotation of micro-emotions. The EQN framework is the first to achieve automatic micro-emotion annotation with energy-level scores, providing strong support for further emotion detection analysis and the quantitative research of emotion computing.

Abstract: Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 97-100% of accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enabled dialogue systems have become one of the central modes in human-machine interaction, which bring about vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. The dialogue's life-cycle spans from $\textit{Prelude}$ through $\textit{Interlocution}$ to $\textit{Epilogue}$, encompassing rich dialogue elements. Despite large volumes of dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of systematic investigation into the dialogue stages to frame benchmark construction that covers comprehensive dialogue elements. This hinders the precise modeling, generation and assessment of LLMs-based dialogue systems. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce a new research task--$\textbf{D}$ialogue $\textbf{E}$lement $\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. On this basis, we further build the DEMO agent with the adept ability to model dialogue elements via imitation learning. Extensive experiments on DEMO indicate that current representative LLMs still have considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent performs well in both dialogue element modeling and out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) systems amplify lexical biases present in their training data, leading to artificially impoverished language in output translations. These language-level characteristics render automatic translations different from text originally written in a language and human translations, which hinders their usefulness in for example creating evaluation datasets. Attempts to increase naturalness in NMT can fall short in terms of content preservation, where increased lexical diversity comes at the cost of translation accuracy. Inspired by the reinforcement learning from human feedback framework, we introduce a novel method that rewards both naturalness and content preservation. We experiment with multiple perspectives to produce more natural translations, aiming at reducing machine and human translationese. We evaluate our method on English-to-Dutch literary translation, and find that our best model produces translations that are lexically richer and exhibit more properties of human-written language, without loss in translation accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces RuleArena, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow complex, real-world rules in reasoning. Covering three practical domains -- airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations -- RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark. We also observe a significant performance boost when LLMs are provided with external tools for oracle math and logic operations. These results highlight significant challenges and promising research directions in advancing LLMs' rule-guided reasoning capabilities in real-life applications. Our codes and data are publicly available on https://github.com/skyriver-2000/RuleArena.

<title>A Rose by Any Other Name: LLM-Generated Explanations Are Good Proxies for Human Explanations to Collect Label Distributions on NLI</title>

Abstract: Disagreement in human labeling is ubiquitous, and can be captured in human judgment distributions (HJDs). Recent research has shown that explanations provide valuable information for understanding human label variation (HLV) and large language models (LLMs) can approximate HJD from a few human-provided label-explanation pairs. However, collecting explanations for every label is still time-consuming. This paper examines whether LLMs can be used to replace humans in generating explanations for approximating HJD. Specifically, we use LLMs as annotators to generate model explanations for a few given human labels. We test ways to obtain and combine these label-explanations with the goal to approximate human judgment distributions. We further compare the resulting human with model-generated explanations, and test automatic and human explanation selection. Our experiments show that LLM explanations are promising for NLI: to estimate HJDs, generated explanations yield comparable results to human's when provided with human labels. Importantly, our results generalize from datasets with human explanations to i) datasets where they are not available and ii) challenging out-of-distribution test sets.

Abstract: The rapid growth of social media platforms has raised significant concerns regarding online content toxicity. When Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for toxicity detection, two key challenges emerge: 1) the absence of domain-specific toxic knowledge leads to false negatives; 2) the excessive sensitivity of LLMs to toxic speech results in false positives, limiting freedom of speech. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called MetaTox, leveraging graph search on a meta-toxic knowledge graph to enhance hatred and toxicity detection. First, we construct a comprehensive meta-toxic knowledge graph by utilizing LLMs to extract toxic information through a three-step pipeline, with toxic benchmark datasets serving as corpora. Second, we query the graph via retrieval and ranking processes to supplement accurate, relevant toxic knowledge. Extensive experiments and in-depth case studies across multiple datasets demonstrate that our MetaTox significantly decreases the false positive rate while boosting overall toxicity detection performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/YiboZhao624/MetaTox.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing but adapting these LLMs to speech processing tasks efficiently is not straightforward. Direct task-specific fine-tuning is limited by overfitting risks, data requirements, and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable, two-stage training approach: (1) A task-independent speech pretraining stage using contrastive learning to align text and speech representations over all layers, followed by (2) a task-specific fine-tuning stage requiring minimal data. This approach outperforms traditional ASR pretraining and enables the model to surpass models specialized on speech translation and question answering while being trained on only 10% of the task-specific data.

Abstract: Automated definition generation systems have been proposed to support vocabulary expansion for language learners. The main barrier to the success of these systems is that learners often struggle to understand definitions due to the presence of potentially unfamiliar words and grammar, particularly when non-standard language is involved. To address these challenges, we propose CLIX, the task of Cross-Lingual explanations of Idiomatic eXpressions. We explore the capabilities of current NLP models for this task, and observe that while it remains challenging, large language models show promise. Finally, we perform a detailed error analysis to highlight the key challenges that need to be addressed before we can reliably incorporate these systems into educational tools.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have made huge strides toward the effective alignment of large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and reflect human values. More recently, Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) have emerged in which the reward modeling stage of RLHF is skipped by characterizing the reward directly as a function of the policy being learned. Some popular examples of DAAs include Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO). These methods often suffer from likelihood displacement, a phenomenon by which the probabilities of preferred responses are often reduced undesirably. In this paper, we argue that, for DAAs the reward (function) shape matters. We introduce \textbf{AlphaPO}, a new DAA method that leverages an $\alpha$-parameter to help change the shape of the reward function beyond the standard log reward. AlphaPO helps maintain fine-grained control over likelihood displacement and over-optimization. Compared to SimPO, one of the best performing DAAs, AlphaPO leads to about 7\% to 10\% relative improvement in alignment performance for the instruct versions of Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B while achieving 15\% to 50\% relative improvement over DPO on the same models. The analysis and results presented highlight the importance of the reward shape and how one can systematically change it to affect training dynamics, as well as improve alignment performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models mostly use a router to assign tokens to specific expert modules, activating only partial parameters and often outperforming dense models. We argue that the separation between the router's decision-making and the experts' execution is a critical yet overlooked issue, leading to suboptimal expert selection and ineffective learning. To address this, we propose Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE), a novel MoE paradigm in which experts autonomously select themselves to process inputs. AoE is based on the insight that an expert is aware of its own capacity to effectively process a token, an awareness reflected in the scale of its internal activations. In AoE, routers are removed; instead, experts pre-compute internal activations for inputs and are ranked based on their activation norms. Only the top-ranking experts proceed with the forward pass, while the others abort. The overhead of pre-computing activations is reduced through a low-rank weight factorization. This self-evaluating-then-partner-comparing approach ensures improved expert selection and effective learning. We pre-train language models having 700M up to 4B parameters, demonstrating that AoE outperforms traditional MoE models with comparable efficiency.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with latent-space memory has attracted increasing attention as they can extend the context window of existing language models. However, retaining information from the distant past remains a challenge. For example, MemoryLLM (Wang et al., 2024a), as a representative work with latent-space memory, compresses past information into hidden states across all layers, forming a memory pool of 1B parameters. While effective for sequence lengths up to 16k tokens, it struggles to retain knowledge beyond 20k tokens. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing M+, a memory-augmented model based on MemoryLLM that significantly enhances long-term information retention. M+ integrates a long-term memory mechanism with a co-trained retriever, dynamically retrieving relevant information during text generation. We evaluate M+ on diverse benchmarks, including long-context understanding and knowledge retention tasks. Experimental results show that M+ significantly outperforms MemoryLLM and recent strong baselines, extending knowledge retention from under 20k to over 160k tokens with similar GPU memory overhead. We open-source our code at https://github.com/wangyu-ustc/MemoryLLM

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized product recommenders, yet their susceptibility to adversarial manipulation poses critical challenges, particularly in real-world commercial applications. Our approach is the first one to tap into human psychological principles, seamlessly modifying product descriptions, making such manipulations hard to detect. In this work, we investigate cognitive biases as black-box adversarial strategies, drawing parallels between their effects on LLMs and human purchasing behavior. Through extensive evaluation across models of varying scale, we find that certain biases, such as social proof, consistently boost product recommendation rate and ranking, while others, like scarcity and exclusivity, surprisingly reduce visibility. Our results demonstrate that cognitive biases are deeply embedded in state-of-the-art LLMs, leading to highly unpredictable behavior in product recommendations and posing significant challenges for effective mitigation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models excel across diverse domains but struggle with complex visual reasoning tasks. Current approaches aim to incorporate structured thinking via two strategies: explicit search methods and post-training techniques. However, both approaches face significant limitations: Search-based methods suffer from computational inefficiency due to extensive solution space exploration, while post-training methods require substantial data, computational resources, and often encounter training instability. To address these limitations, we propose AStar, an \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{t}hinking paradigm for multimod\textbf{a}l \textbf{r}easoning. Our method introduces "thought cards", a lightweight library of high-level reasoning patterns abstracted from 500 prior samples using Monte Carlo Tree Search. For each test problem, AStar adaptively retrieves the optimal thought cards and seamlessly integrates these external explicit guidelines with the model's internal implicit reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate AStar's effectiveness and efficiency: using only 500 prior samples and a 7B backbone, our training-free framework achieves 53.9$\%$ accuracy on MathVerse (surpassing GPT-4o's 50.2%) and 32.7% on MathVision (versus GPT-4o's 30.4%). Further analysis reveals that AStar generalizes beyond multimodal reasoning to visual perception and understanding domains, and serves as a plug-and-play test-time inference method compatible with mainstream post-training techniques like GRPO.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with inputs exceeding their training context window due to positional out-of-distribution (O.O.D.) issues that disrupt attention. Existing solutions, including fine-tuning and training-free methods, face challenges like inefficiency, redundant interpolation, logit outliers, or loss of local positional information. We propose Greedy Attention Logit Interpolation (GALI), a training-free method that improves length extrapolation by greedily reusing pretrained positional intervals and interpolating attention logit to eliminate outliers. GALI achieves stable and superior performance across a wide range of long-context tasks without requiring input-length-specific tuning. Our analysis further reveals that LLMs interpret positional intervals unevenly and that restricting interpolation to narrower ranges improves performance, even on short-context tasks. GALI represents a step toward more robust and generalizable long-text processing in LLMs. Our implementation of GALI, along with the experiments from our paper, is open-sourced at https://github.com/adlnlp/Gali.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks through in-context learning (ICL), which heavily relies on the demonstrations selected from annotated datasets. However, these datasets often exhibit long-tailed class distributions in real-world scenarios, leading to biased demonstration selection. In this work, we show that such class imbalances significantly degrade the ICL performance across various tasks, regardless of selection methods. Moreover, classical rebalancing methods, which focus solely on class weights, yield poor performance due to neglecting condition bias--skewed feature distributions within classes. To address this, we propose Reweighting with Conditional Bias (dubbed RCB), a simple and complementary approach to enhance ICL performance under class imbalance. In particular, RCB estimates conditional bias using a balanced subset and re-weights demonstration scores based on both class weight and conditional bias. In effect, RCB prevents over-selection from dominant classes while preserving the efficacy of current selection methods. Extensive experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average accuracy of current selection methods by up to 5.42%.

Abstract: With the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in integrating speech representations with them to enable more seamless multi-modal processing and speech understanding. This study introduces a novel approach that combines self-supervised speech representations with instruction-tuned LLMs for speech-to-text translation. The proposed approach leverages a modality adapter to align extracted speech features with instruction-tuned LLMs using English speech data. Our experiments demonstrate that this method effectively preserves the semantic content of the input speech and serves as an effective bridge between self-supervised speech models and instruction-tuned LLMs, offering a promising approach for various speech understanding applications.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied in various domains, the safety of LLMs is increasingly attracting attention to avoid their powerful capabilities being misused. Existing jailbreak methods create a forced instruction-following scenario, or search adversarial prompts with prefix or suffix tokens to achieve a specific representation manually or automatically. However, they suffer from low efficiency and explicit jailbreak patterns, far from the real deployment of mass attacks to LLMs. In this paper, we point out that simply rewriting the original instruction can achieve a jailbreak, and we find that this rewriting approach is learnable and transferable. We propose the Rewrite to Jailbreak (R2J) approach, a transferable black-box jailbreak method to attack LLMs by iteratively exploring the weakness of the LLMs and automatically improving the attacking strategy. The jailbreak is more efficient and hard to identify since no additional features are introduced. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of R2J, and we find that the jailbreak is also transferable to multiple datasets and various types of models with only a few queries. We hope our work motivates further investigation of LLM safety. The code can be found at https://github.com/ythuang02/R2J/.

Abstract: Detecting disinformation that blends manipulated text and images has become increasingly challenging, as AI tools make synthetic content easy to generate and disseminate. While most existing AI safety benchmarks focus on single modality misinformation (i.e., false content shared without intent to deceive), intentional multimodal disinformation, such as propaganda or conspiracy theories that imitate credible news, remains largely unaddressed. We introduce the Vision-Language Disinformation Detection Benchmark (VLDBench), the first large-scale resource supporting both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) disinformation detection. VLDBench comprises approximately 62,000 labeled text-image pairs across 13 categories, curated from 58 news outlets. Using a semi-automated pipeline followed by expert review, 22 domain experts invested over 500 hours to produce high-quality annotations with substantial inter-annotator agreement. Evaluations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on VLDBench show that incorporating visual cues improves detection accuracy by 5 to 35 percentage points over text-only models. VLDBench provides data and code for evaluation, fine-tuning, and robustness testing to support disinformation analysis. Developed in alignment with AI governance frameworks (e.g., the MIT AI Risk Repository), VLDBench offers a principled foundation for advancing trustworthy disinformation detection in multimodal media.

Abstract: Tool learning has emerged as a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs) to solve complex real-world tasks through interaction with external tools. Existing approaches face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-crafted prompts, difficulty in multi-step planning, and lack of precise error diagnosis and reflection mechanisms. We propose ToolCoder, a novel framework that reformulates tool learning as a code generation task. Inspired by software engineering principles, ToolCoder transforms natural language queries into structured Python function scaffold and systematically breaks down tasks with descriptive comments, enabling LLMs to leverage coding paradigms for complex reasoning and planning. It then generates and executes function implementations to obtain final responses. Additionally, ToolCoder stores successfully executed functions in a repository to promote code reuse, while leveraging error traceback mechanisms for systematic debugging, optimizing both execution efficiency and robustness. Experiments demonstrate that ToolCoder achieves superior performance in task completion accuracy and execution reliability compared to existing approaches, establishing the effectiveness of code-centric approaches in tool learning.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), which aims to infer missing or incomplete facts, is a crucial task for KGs. However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency.Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input.Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Complex instruction-following with elaborate constraints is imperative for Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing methods have constructed data for complex instruction alignment, they all rely on a more advanced model, especially GPT-4, limiting their application. In this paper, we propose a Multi-granularity Self-Contrastive Training (MuSC) framework, to improve the complex instruction alignment without relying on a stronger model. Our method is conducted on both coarse and fine granularity. On coarse-granularity, we construct constraint-aware preference data based on instruction decomposition and recombination. On fine-granularity, we perform token-aware preference optimization with dynamic token-level supervision. Our method is evaluated on open-sourced models, and experiment results show our method achieves significant improvement on both complex and general instruction-following benchmarks, surpassing previous self-alignment methods.

Abstract: Tool use has turned large language models (LLMs) into powerful agents that can perform complex multi-step tasks by dynamically utilising external software components. However, these tools must be implemented in advance by human developers, hindering the applicability of LLM agents in domains demanding large numbers of highly specialised tools, like in life sciences and medicine. Motivated by the growing trend of scientific studies accompanied by public code repositories, we propose ToolMaker, an agentic framework that autonomously transforms papers with code into LLM-compatible tools. Given a GitHub URL and short task description, ToolMaker autonomously installs dependencies and generates code to perform the task, using a closed-loop self-correction mechanism for debugging. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark comprising 15 complex computational tasks spanning various domains with over 100 unit tests to assess correctness and robustness. Our method correctly implements 80% of the tasks, substantially outperforming current state-of-the-art software engineering agents. ToolMaker therefore is a step towards fully autonomous agent-based scientific workflows. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/KatherLab/ToolMaker.

Abstract: The evaluation of factual accuracy in large vision language models (LVLMs) has lagged behind their rapid development, making it challenging to fully reflect these models' knowledge capacity and reliability. In this paper, we introduce the first factuality-based visual question-answering benchmark in Chinese, named ChineseSimpleVQA, aimed at assessing the visual factuality of LVLMs across 8 major topics and 56 subtopics. The key features of this benchmark include a focus on the Chinese language, diverse knowledge types, a multi-hop question construction, high-quality data, static consistency, and easy-to-evaluate through short answers. Moreover, we contribute a rigorous data construction pipeline and decouple the visual factuality into two parts: seeing the world (i.e., object recognition) and discovering knowledge. This decoupling allows us to analyze the capability boundaries and execution mechanisms of LVLMs. Subsequently, we evaluate 34 advanced open-source and closed-source models, revealing critical performance gaps within this field. Our evaluation-friendly code and data have already been open-sourced.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) develop cross-lingual abilities despite being trained on limited parallel data. However, they often struggle to generate responses in the intended language, favoring high-resource languages such as English. In this work, we introduce CoCo-CoLa (Correct Concept - Correct Language), a novel metric to evaluate language adherence in multilingual LLMs. Using fine-tuning experiments on a closed-book QA task across seven languages, we analyze how training in one language affects others' performance. Our findings reveal that multilingual models share task knowledge across languages but exhibit biases in the selection of output language. We identify language-specific layers, showing that final layers play a crucial role in determining output language. Accordingly, we propose a partial training strategy that selectively fine-tunes key layers, improving language adherence while significantly reducing computational cost. Our method achieves comparable or superior performance to full fine-tuning, particularly for low-resource languages, offering a more efficient multilingual adaptation.

Abstract: Multi-turn instruction following capability constitutes a core competency of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on fine-grained constraint satisfaction and domain-specific capability assessment, yet overlook the crucial structural dependencies between dialogue turns that distinguish multi-turn from single-turn interactions. These structural dependencies not only reflect user intent but also establish an essential second dimension for the instruction following evaluation beyond constraint satisfaction. To address this gap, we propose StructFlowBench, a multi-turn instruction following benchmark with structural flow modeling. The benchmark defines an innovative structural flow framework with six fundamental inter-turn relationships. These relationships introduce novel structural constraints for model evaluation and also serve as generation parameters for creating customized dialogue flows tailored to specific scenarios. Adopting established LLM-based automatic evaluation methodologies, we conduct systematic evaluations of 13 leading open-source and closed-source LLMs. Experimental results reveal significant deficiencies in current models' comprehension of multi-turn dialogue structures. The code is available at https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/StructFlowBench.

Abstract: This work investigates the ability of open Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict citation intent through in-context learning and fine-tuning. Unlike traditional approaches relying on domain-specific pre-trained models like SciBERT, we demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs can be adapted to this task with minimal task-specific data. We evaluate twelve model variations across five prominent open LLM families using zero-, one-, few-, and many-shot prompting. Our experimental study identifies the top-performing model and prompting parameters through extensive in-context learning experiments. We then demonstrate the significant impact of task-specific adaptation by fine-tuning this model, achieving a relative F1-score improvement of 8% on the SciCite dataset and 4.3% on the ACL-ARC dataset compared to the instruction-tuned baseline. These findings provide valuable insights for model selection and prompt engineering. Additionally, we make our end-to-end evaluation framework and models openly available for future use.

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems usually take the user-platform paradigm, where users are directly exposed under the control of the platform's recommendation algorithms. However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.

Abstract: While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities at task-specific applications through fine-tuning, extending these benefits across diverse languages is essential for broad accessibility. However, effective cross-lingual transfer is hindered by LLM performance gaps across languages and the scarcity of fine-tuning data in many languages. Through analysis of LLM internal representations from over 1,000+ language pairs, we discover that middle layers exhibit the strongest potential for cross-lingual alignment. Building on this finding, we propose a middle-layer alignment objective integrated into task-specific training. Our experiments on slot filling, machine translation, and structured text generation show consistent improvements in cross-lingual transfer, especially to lower-resource languages. The method is robust to the choice of alignment languages and generalizes to languages unseen during alignment. Furthermore, we show that separately trained alignment modules can be merged with existing task-specific modules, improving cross-lingual capabilities without full re-training. Our code is publicly available (https://github.com/dannigt/mid-align).

<title>TETRIS: Optimal Draft Token Selection for Batch Speculative Decoding</title>

Abstract: We propose TETRIS, a novel method that optimizes the total throughput of batch speculative decoding in multi-request settings. Unlike existing methods that optimize for a single request or a group of requests as a whole, TETRIS actively selects the most promising draft tokens (for every request in a batch) to be accepted when verified in parallel, resulting in fewer rejected tokens and hence less wasted computing resources. Such an effective resource utilization to achieve fast inference in large language models (LLMs) is especially important to service providers with limited inference capacity. Compared to baseline speculative decoding, TETRIS yields a consistently higher acceptance rate and more effective utilization of the limited inference capacity. We show theoretically and empirically that TETRIS outperforms baseline speculative decoding and existing methods that dynamically select draft tokens, leading to a more efficient batch inference in LLMs.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) can significantly enhance the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with the key lying in the selection and ordering of demonstration examples. Previous methods typically relied on simple features to measure the relevance between examples. We argue that these features are not sufficient to reflect the intrinsic connections between examples. In this study, we propose a curriculum ICL strategy guided by problem-solving logic. We select demonstration examples by analyzing the problem-solving logic and order them based on curriculum learning. Specifically, we constructed a problem-solving logic instruction set based on the BREAK dataset and fine-tuned a language model to analyze the problem-solving logic of examples. Subsequently, we selected appropriate demonstration examples based on problem-solving logic and assessed their difficulty according to the number of problem-solving steps. In accordance with the principles of curriculum learning, we ordered the examples from easy to hard to serve as contextual prompts. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks indicate that our method outperforms previous ICL approaches in terms of performance and efficiency, effectively enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our project will be released at https://github.com/maxuetao/CurriculumICL

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate multiple task-specific models into a unified model that inherits the capabilities of the task-specific models, without additional training. Existing model merging methods often lack consideration of the varying contribution ratios of different task-specific models to the final merged model. In this paper, we propose Mixup Model Merge (M3), a simple yet effective method inspired by the randomized linear interpolation strategy from the Mixup data augmentation technique. M3 performs randomized linear interpolation in parameter space between two task-specific LLMs, where interpolation coefficients are sampled from a Beta distribution to explore diverse contribution ratios. This controllable randomness allows M3 to outperform standard equal-ratio merging by discovering better contribution ratio combinations. Extensive experiments show that M3 significantly (1) improves merged LLM performance across tasks, (2) enhances out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness, and (3) outperforms the positive effects of the sparsification method DARE on model merging and can be further combined with DARE to achieve superior results. By tuning the Beta distribution's shape parameters, (4) M3 balances exploration efficiency and diversity in contribution ratios.

Abstract: Automating scientific research is considered the final frontier of science. Recently, several papers claim autonomous research agents can generate novel research ideas. Amidst the prevailing optimism, we document a critical concern: a considerable fraction of such research documents are smartly plagiarized. Unlike past efforts where experts evaluate the novelty and feasibility of research ideas, we request $13$ experts to operate under a different situational logic: to identify similarities between LLM-generated research documents and existing work. Concerningly, the experts identify $24\%$ of the $50$ evaluated research documents to be either paraphrased (with one-to-one methodological mapping), or significantly borrowed from existing work. These reported instances are cross-verified by authors of the source papers. Experts find an additional $32\%$ ideas to partially overlap with prior work, and a small fraction to be completely original. Problematically, these LLM-generated research documents do not acknowledge original sources, and bypass inbuilt plagiarism detectors. Lastly, through controlled experiments we show that automated plagiarism detectors are inadequate at catching plagiarized ideas from such systems. We recommend a careful assessment of LLM-generated research, and discuss the implications of our findings on academic publishing.

Abstract: We introduce MAIA (Multimodal AI Assessment), a native-Italian benchmark designed for fine-grained investigation of the reasoning abilities of visual language models on videos. MAIA differs from other available video benchmarks for its design, its reasoning categories, the metric it uses, and the language and culture of the videos. MAIA evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on two aligned tasks: a visual statement verification task and an open-ended visual question-answering task, both on the same set of video-related questions. It considers twelve reasoning categories that aim to disentangle language and vision relations by highlighting the role of the visual input. Thanks to its carefully taught design, it evaluates VLMs' consistency and visually grounded natural language comprehension and generation simultaneously through an aggregated metric revealing low results that highlight models' fragility. Last but not least, the video collection has been carefully selected to reflect the Italian culture, and the language data are produced by native-speakers.

Abstract: The Javanese language features a complex system of honorifics that vary according to the social status of the speaker, listener, and referent. Despite its cultural and linguistic significance, there has been limited progress in developing a comprehensive corpus to capture these variations for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present Unggah-Ungguh, a carefully curated dataset designed to encapsulate the nuances of Unggah-Ungguh Basa, the Javanese speech etiquette framework that dictates the choice of words and phrases based on social hierarchy and context. Using Unggah-Ungguh, we assess the ability of language models (LMs) to process various levels of Javanese honorifics through classification and machine translation tasks. To further evaluate cross-lingual LMs, we conduct machine translation experiments between Javanese (at specific honorific levels) and Indonesian. Additionally, we explore whether LMs can generate contextually appropriate Javanese honorifics in conversation tasks, where the honorific usage should align with the social role and contextual cues. Our findings indicate that current LMs struggle with most honorific levels, exhibitinga bias toward certain honorific tiers.

Abstract: In Switzerland legal translation is uniquely important due to the country's four official languages and requirements for multilingual legal documentation. However, this process traditionally relies on professionals who must be both legal experts and skilled translators -- creating bottlenecks and impacting effective access to justice. To address this challenge, we introduce SwiLTra-Bench, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark of over 180K aligned Swiss legal translation pairs comprising laws, headnotes, and press releases across all Swiss languages along with English, designed to evaluate LLM-based translation systems. Our systematic evaluation reveals that frontier models achieve superior translation performance across all document types, while specialized translation systems excel specifically in laws but under-perform in headnotes. Through rigorous testing and human expert validation, we demonstrate that while fine-tuning open SLMs significantly improves their translation quality, they still lag behind the best zero-shot prompted frontier models such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Additionally, we present SwiLTra-Judge, a specialized LLM evaluation system that aligns best with human expert assessments.

Abstract: Large language models have recently pushed open domain question answering (ODQA) to new frontiers. However, prevailing retriever-reader pipelines often depend on multiple rounds of prompt level instructions, leading to high computational overhead, instability, and suboptimal retrieval coverage. In this paper, we propose EmbQA, an embedding-level framework that alleviates these shortcomings by enhancing both the retriever and the reader. Specifically, we refine query representations via lightweight linear layers under an unsupervised contrastive learning objective, thereby reordering retrieved passages to highlight those most likely to contain correct answers. Additionally, we introduce an exploratory embedding that broadens the model's latent semantic space to diversify candidate generation and employs an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most confident answer automatically. Extensive experiments across three open-source LLMs, three retrieval methods, and four ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that EmbQA substantially outperforms recent baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Cross-modal entity linking refers to the ability to align entities and their attributes across different modalities. While cross-modal entity linking is a fundamental skill needed for real-world applications such as multimodal code generation, fake news detection, or scene understanding, it has not been thoroughly studied in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a new task and benchmark to address this gap. Our benchmark, MATE, consists of 5.5k evaluation instances featuring visual scenes aligned with their textual representations. To evaluate cross-modal entity linking performance, we design a question-answering task that involves retrieving one attribute of an object in one modality based on a unique attribute of that object in another modality. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and humans on this task, and find that VLMs struggle significantly compared to humans, particularly as the number of objects in the scene increases. Our analysis also shows that, while chain-of-thought prompting can improve VLM performance, models remain far from achieving human-level proficiency. These findings highlight the need for further research in cross-modal entity linking and show that MATE is a strong benchmark to support that progress.

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling has been critical to the success of recent models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1. However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect HelpSteer3 data to train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3.

Abstract: In recent years, the need for natural language interfaces to knowledge graphs has become increasingly important since they enable easy and efficient access to the information contained in them. In particular, property graphs (PGs) have seen increased adoption as a means of representing complex structured information. Despite their growing popularity in industry, PGs remain relatively underrepresented in semantic parsing research with a lack of resources for evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce ZOGRASCOPE, a benchmark designed specifically for PGs and queries written in Cypher. Our benchmark includes a diverse set of manually annotated queries of varying complexity and is organized into three partitions: iid, compositional and length. We complement this paper with a set of experiments that test the performance of different LLMs in a variety of learning settings.

Abstract: Despite the success of distillation in large language models (LLMs), most prior work applies identical loss functions to both teacher- and student-generated data. These strategies overlook the synergy between loss formulations and data types, leading to a suboptimal performance boost in student models. To address this, we propose DistiLLM-2, a contrastive approach that simultaneously increases the likelihood of teacher responses and decreases that of student responses by harnessing this synergy. Our extensive experiments show that DistiLLM-2 not only builds high-performing student models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction-following and code generation, but also supports diverse applications, such as preference alignment and vision-language extensions. These findings highlight the potential of a contrastive approach to enhance the efficacy of LLM distillation by effectively aligning teacher and student models across varied data types.

<title>TROVE: A Challenge for Fine-Grained Text Provenance via Source Sentence Tracing and Relationship Classification</title>

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable fluency and coherence in text generation, yet their widespread adoption has raised concerns about content reliability and accountability. In high-stakes domains, it is crucial to understand where and how the content is created. To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs. Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed. To benchmark TROVE, we construct our dataset by leveraging three public datasets covering 11 diverse scenarios (e.g., QA and summarization) in English and Chinese, spanning source texts of varying lengths (0-5k, 5-10k, 10k+), emphasizing the multi-document and long-document settings essential for provenance. To ensure high-quality data, we employ a three-stage annotation process: sentence retrieval, GPT-4o provenance, and human provenance. We evaluate 11 LLMs under direct prompting and retrieval-augmented paradigms, revealing that retrieval is essential for robust performance, larger models perform better in complex relationship classification, and closed-source models often lead, yet open-source models show significant promise, particularly with retrieval augmentation. We make our dataset available here: https://github.com/ZNLP/ZNLP-Dataset.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires reasoning across visual and textual modalities, yet Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often lack integrated commonsense knowledge, limiting their robustness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce MAGIC-VQA, a novel framework that enhances VQA by systematically integrating commonsense knowledge with LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA employs a three-stage process: (1) Explicit Knowledge Integration from external sources, (2) By-Type Post-Processing for contextual refinement, and (3) Implicit Knowledge Augmentation using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for structured reasoning. While GNNs bring greater depth to structured inference, they enable superior relational inference beyond LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA bridges a key gap by unifying commonsensse knowledge with LVLM-driven reasoning, eliminating the need for extensive pre-training or complex prompt tuning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, significantly improving commonsense reasoning in VQA.

<title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Reward Scaling for LLM Alignment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Robust alignment is vital for safely deploying large language models (LLMs). Existing techniques are either reward-based -- training a reward model on preference pairs and optimizing with reinforcement learning (RL) -- or reward-free -- directly fine-tuning on ranked outputs. Recent research shows that well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain the most robust, and single-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data. However, two key challenges remain: (i) imbalanced safety datasets that over-represent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (ii) static reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization efficiency and attainable gains. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{DR-IRL}, which dynamically adjusts rewards through inverse reinforcement learning. We first construct a balanced safety dataset of seven harmful categories using Chain-of-Draft (CoD) template prompts, which reduce token usage and generation time compared to Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We then train category-specific reward models on this dataset via IRL. Finally, to align the LLM, we introduce \textbf{GRPO-S} (Group Relative Policy Optimization--Scaling), a variant of GRPO that scales the reward during optimization to task difficulty -- data-level hardness measured by CLIP similarity and model-level responsiveness measured by reward gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that DR-IRL outperforms all baselines in safety alignment while maintaining usefulness.

<title>An Explicit Syllogistic Legal Reasoning Framework for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Syllogistic reasoning is crucial for sound legal decision-making, allowing legal professionals to draw logical conclusions by applying general principles to specific case facts. While large language models (LLMs) can answer legal questions, they often struggle with explicit syllogistic reasoning. Their outputs tend to be implicit, unstructured, and consequently, less explainable and trustworthy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyLeR, a novel framework designed to enable LLMs to perform explicit syllogistic legal reasoning. SyLeR employs a tree-structured hierarchical retrieval mechanism to synthesize relevant legal statutes and precedents, thereby constructing comprehensive major premises. This is followed by a two-stage fine-tuning process: an initial supervised fine-tuning warm-up establishes a foundational understanding of syllogistic reasoning, while reinforcement learning, guided by a structure-aware reward mechanism, refines the model's capacity to generate diverse, logically sound, and well-structured reasoning paths. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate SyLeR's performance. Our evaluations spanned diverse dimensions, including both in-domain and cross-domain user groups (legal laypersons and practitioners), multiple languages (Chinese and French), and various LLM backbones (legal-specific and open-domain LLMs). The results consistently demonstrate that SyLeR significantly enhances response accuracy and reliably produces explicit, explainable, and trustworthy legal reasoning.

<title>RAISE: Reinforced Adaptive Instruction Selection For Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.07282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), it is widely recognized that a few high-quality instructions are superior to a large number of low-quality instructions. At present, many instruction selection methods have been proposed, but most of these methods select instruction based on heuristic quality metrics, and only consider data selection before training. These designs lead to insufficient optimization of instruction fine-tuning, and fixed heuristic indicators are often difficult to optimize for specific tasks. Therefore, we design a dynamic, task-objective-driven instruction selection framework RAISE(Reinforced Adaptive Instruction SElection), which incorporates the entire instruction fine-tuning process into optimization, selecting instructions at each step based on the expected impact of each instruction on model performance improvement. Our approach is well interpretable and has strong task-specific optimization capabilities. By modeling dynamic instruction selection as a sequential decision-making process, we use RL to train our selection strategy. Extensive experiments and result analysis prove the superiority of our method compared with other instruction selection methods. Notably, RAISE achieves superior performance by updating only 1% of the training steps compared to full-data training, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Determining and ranking the most salient entities in a text is critical for user-facing systems, especially as users increasingly rely on models to interpret long documents they only partially read. Graded entity salience addresses this need by assigning entities scores that reflect their relative importance in a text. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: subjective judgments of salience, which allow for gradient scoring but lack consistency, and summarization-based methods, which define salience as mention-worthiness in a summary, promoting explainability but limiting outputs to binary labels (entities are either summary-worthy or not). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for graded entity salience that combines the strengths of both approaches. Using an English dataset spanning 12 spoken and written genres, we collect 5 summaries per document and calculate each entity's salience score based on its presence across these summaries. Our approach shows stronger correlation with scores based on human summaries and alignments, and outperforms existing techniques, including LLMs. We release our data and code at https://github.com/jl908069/gum_sum_salience to support further research on graded salient entity extraction.

<title>From Misleading Queries to Accurate Answers: A Three-Stage Fine-Tuning Method for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit excellent performance in natural language processing (NLP), but remain highly sensitive to the quality of input queries, especially when these queries contain misleading or inaccurate information. Existing methods focus on correcting the output, but they often overlook the potential of improving the ability of LLMs to detect and correct misleading content in the input itself. In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage fine-tuning method that enhances the ability of LLMs to detect and correct misleading information in the input, further improving response accuracy and reducing hallucinations. Specifically, the three stages include (1) training LLMs to identify misleading information, (2) training LLMs to correct the misleading information using built-in or external knowledge, and (3) training LLMs to generate accurate answers based on the corrected queries. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on three datasets for the hallucination detection task and the question answering~(QA) task, as well as two datasets containing misleading information that we constructed. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy and factuality of LLM responses, while also enhancing the ability to detect hallucinations and reducing the generation of hallucinations in the output, particularly when the query contains misleading information.

Abstract: Prompt engineering for large language models is challenging, as even small prompt perturbations or model changes can significantly impact the generated output texts. Existing evaluation methods of LLM outputs, either automated metrics or human evaluation, have limitations, such as providing limited insights or being labor-intensive. We propose Spotlight, a new approach that combines both automation and human analysis. Based on data mining techniques, we automatically distinguish between random (decoding) variations and systematic differences in language model outputs. This process provides token patterns that describe the systematic differences and guide the user in manually analyzing the effects of their prompts and changes in models efficiently. We create three benchmarks to quantitatively test the reliability of token pattern extraction methods and demonstrate that our approach provides new insights into established prompt data. From a human-centric perspective, through demonstration studies and a user study, we show that our token pattern approach helps users understand the systematic differences of language model outputs. We are further able to discover relevant differences caused by prompt and model changes (e.g. related to gender or culture), thus supporting the prompt engineering process and human-centric model behavior research.

Abstract: Extracting scientific evidence from biomedical studies for clinical research questions (e.g., Does stem cell transplantation improve quality of life in patients with medically refractory Crohn's disease compared to placebo?) is a crucial step in synthesising biomedical evidence. In this paper, we focus on the task of document-level scientific evidence extraction for clinical questions with conflicting evidence. To support this task, we create a dataset called CochraneForest, leveraging forest plots from Cochrane systematic reviews. It comprises 202 annotated forest plots, associated clinical research questions, full texts of studies, and study-specific conclusions. Building on CochraneForest, we propose URCA (Uniform Retrieval Clustered Augmentation), a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of evidence extraction. Our experiments show that URCA outperforms the best existing methods by up to 10.3% in F1 score on this task. However, the results also underscore the complexity of CochraneForest, establishing it as a challenging testbed for advancing automated evidence synthesis systems.

Abstract: We introduce Llama-Krikri-8B, a cutting-edge Large Language Model tailored for the Greek language, built on Meta's Llama 3.1-8B. Llama-Krikri-8B has been extensively trained on high-quality Greek data to ensure superior adaptation to linguistic nuances. With 8 billion parameters, it offers advanced capabilities while maintaining efficient computational performance. Llama-Krikri-8B supports both Modern Greek and English, and is also equipped to handle polytonic text and Ancient Greek. The chat version of Llama-Krikri-8B features a multi-stage post-training pipeline, utilizing both human and synthetic instruction and preference data, by applying techniques such as MAGPIE. In addition, for evaluation, we propose three novel public benchmarks for Greek. Our evaluation on existing as well as the proposed benchmarks shows notable improvements over comparable Greek and multilingual LLMs in both natural language understanding and generation as well as code generation.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents have shown great potential in following human instructions and automatically completing various tasks. To complete a task, the agent needs to decompose it into easily executed steps by planning. Existing studies mainly conduct the planning by inferring what steps should be executed next starting from the agent's initial state. However, this forward reasoning paradigm doesn't work well for complex tasks. We propose to study this issue in Minecraft, a virtual environment that simulates complex tasks based on real-world scenarios. We believe that the failure of forward reasoning is caused by the big perception gap between the agent's initial state and task goal. To this end, we leverage backward reasoning and make the planning starting from the terminal state, which can directly achieve the task goal in one step. Specifically, we design a BAckward Reasoning based agent (BAR). It is equipped with a recursive goal decomposition module, a state consistency maintaining module and a stage memory module to make robust, consistent, and efficient planning starting from the terminal state. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BAR over existing methods and the effectiveness of proposed modules.

Abstract: As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses these gaps. Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy, we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs' vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach substantially improves their safety performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become central to NLP, demonstrating their ability to adapt to various tasks through prompting techniques, including sentiment analysis. However, we still have a limited understanding of how these models capture sentiment-related information. This study probes the hidden layers of Llama models to pinpoint where sentiment features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment analysis.
  Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to 14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%.
  These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs, suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory requirements.

Abstract: The speech tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally serving as a bridge between speech signals and language models. While low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features. The results provide insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and other speech-related applications.

Abstract: Hypothesis ranking is a crucial component of automated scientific discovery, particularly in natural sciences where wet-lab experiments are costly and throughput-limited. Existing approaches focus on pre-experiment ranking, relying solely on large language model's internal reasoning without incorporating empirical outcomes from experiments. We introduce the task of experiment-guided ranking, which aims to prioritize candidate hypotheses based on the results of previously tested ones. However, developing such strategies is challenging due to the impracticality of repeatedly conducting real experiments in natural science domains. To address this, we propose a simulator grounded in three domain-informed assumptions, modeling hypothesis performance as a function of similarity to a known ground truth hypothesis, perturbed by noise. We curate a dataset of 124 chemistry hypotheses with experimentally reported outcomes to validate the simulator. Building on this simulator, we develop a pseudo experiment-guided ranking method that clusters hypotheses by shared functional characteristics and prioritizes candidates based on insights derived from simulated experimental feedback. Experiments show that our method outperforms pre-experiment baselines and strong ablations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of downstream natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, their considerable sizes and memory demands hinder practical deployment, underscoring the importance of developing efficient compression strategies. Singular value decomposition (SVD) decomposes a matrix into orthogonal components, enabling efficient low-rank approximation. This is particularly suitable for LLM compression, where weight matrices often exhibit significant redundancy. However, current SVD-based methods neglect the residual matrix from truncation, resulting in significant truncation loss. Additionally, compressing all layers of the model results in severe performance degradation. To overcome these limitations, we propose ResSVD, a new post-training SVD-based LLM compression method. Specifically, we leverage the residual matrix generated during the truncation process to reduce truncation loss. Moreover, under a fixed overall compression ratio, we selectively compress the last few layers of the model, which mitigates error propagation and significantly improves the performance of compressed models. Comprehensive evaluations of ResSVD on diverse LLM families and multiple benchmark datasets indicate that ResSVD consistently achieves superior performance over existing counterpart methods, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Despite dropout's ubiquity in machine learning, its effectiveness as a form of data augmentation remains under-explored. We address two key questions: (i) When is dropout effective as an augmentation strategy? (ii) Is dropout uniquely effective under these conditions? To explore these questions, we propose Deep Augmentation, a network- and modality-agnostic method that applies dropout or PCA transformations to targeted layers in neural networks. Through extensive experiments on contrastive learning tasks in NLP, computer vision, and graph learning, we find that uniformly applying dropout across layers does not consistently improve performance. Instead, dropout proves most beneficial in deeper layers and can be matched by alternative augmentations (e.g., PCA). We also show that a stop-gradient operation is critical for ensuring dropout functions effectively as an augmentation, and that performance trends invert when moving from contrastive tasks to supervised tasks. Our analysis suggests that Deep Augmentation helps mitigate inter-layer co-adaptation -- a notable issue in self-supervised learning due to the absence of labeled data. Drawing on these insights, we outline a procedure for selecting the optimal augmentation layer and demonstrate that Deep Augmentation can outperform traditional input-level augmentations. This simple yet powerful approach can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of architectures and modalities, yielding notable gains in both performance and generalization.

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models have enabled significant advances in fully supervised and zero-shot visual tasks. These large architectures serve as the baseline to what is currently known as Instruction Tuning Large Vision and Language models (IT-LVLMs). IT-LVLMs are general-purpose multi-modal assistants whose responses are modulated by natural language instructions and visual data. Despite this versatility, IT-LVLM effectiveness in fundamental computer vision problems remains unclear, primarily due to the absence of a standardized evaluation benchmark. This paper introduces a Multi-modal Evaluation Benchmark named MERLIM, a scalable test-bed to assess the capabilities of IT-LVLMs on fundamental computer vision tasks. MERLIM contains over 300K image-question pairs and has a strong focus on detecting cross-modal "hallucination" events in IT-LVLMs. Our results bring important insights on the performance of state-of-the-art IT-LVLMs including limitations at identifying fine-grained visual concepts, object hallucinations across tasks, and biases towards the language query. Our findings also suggest that these models have weak visual grounding, but manage to make adequate guesses from global visual patterns or language biases contained in the LLM component. We name this phenomenon of correct answers with no visual grounding as hidden hallucinations.

Abstract: Style transfer for out-of-domain (OOD) singing voice synthesis (SVS) focuses on generating high-quality singing voices with unseen styles (such as timbre, emotion, pronunciation, and articulation skills) derived from reference singing voice samples. However, the endeavor to model the intricate nuances of singing voice styles is an arduous task, as singing voices possess a remarkable degree of expressiveness. Moreover, existing SVS methods encounter a decline in the quality of synthesized singing voices in OOD scenarios, as they rest upon the assumption that the target vocal attributes are discernible during the training phase. To overcome these challenges, we propose StyleSinger, the first singing voice synthesis model for zero-shot style transfer of out-of-domain reference singing voice samples. StyleSinger incorporates two critical approaches for enhanced effectiveness: 1) the Residual Style Adaptor (RSA) which employs a residual quantization module to capture diverse style characteristics in singing voices, and 2) the Uncertainty Modeling Layer Normalization (UMLN) to perturb the style attributes within the content representation during the training phase and thus improve the model generalization. Our extensive evaluations in zero-shot style transfer undeniably establish that StyleSinger outperforms baseline models in both audio quality and similarity to the reference singing voice samples. Access to singing voice samples can be found at https://aaronz345.github.io/StyleSingerDemo/.

Abstract: Given the high computational cost of preference alignment training of large language models (LLMs), exploring efficient methods to reduce the training overhead remains an important and compelling research problem. Motivated by the observation that alignment training typically involves only small parameter changes without injecting new knowledge into models, we propose a straightforward method called ExPO (model extrapolation) to expedite LLMs' alignment with human preferences. Given a partially-trained model and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO improves the implicit optimization objective of alignment training by simply amplifying the parameter change based on a first-order approximation, without any additional training overhead. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that ExPO boosts a DPO model trained with only 20% steps to outperform the fully-trained one. Moreover, we show that ExPO notably improves existing open-source LLMs (ranging from 1.8B to 70B parameters) on the leading AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench benchmarks, which highlights ExPO's broader utility in efficiently enhancing LLM alignment.

Abstract: In the quest for artificial general intelligence, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a focal point in recent advancements. However, the predominant focus remains on developing their capabilities in static image understanding. The potential of MLLMs in processing sequential visual data is still insufficiently explored, highlighting the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality assessment of their performance. In this paper, we introduce Video-MME, the first-ever full-spectrum, Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of MLLMs in Video analysis. Our work distinguishes from existing benchmarks through four key features: 1) Diversity in video types, spanning 6 primary visual domains with 30 subfields to ensure broad scenario generalizability; 2) Duration in temporal dimension, encompassing both short-, medium-, and long-term videos, ranging from 11 seconds to 1 hour, for robust contextual dynamics; 3) Breadth in data modalities, integrating multi-modal inputs besides video frames, including subtitles and audios, to unveil the all-round capabilities of MLLMs; 4) Quality in annotations, utilizing rigorous manual labeling by expert annotators to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. 900 videos with a total of 254 hours are manually selected and annotated by repeatedly viewing all the video content, resulting in 2,700 question-answer pairs. With Video-MME, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4 series and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source image models like InternVL-Chat-V1.5 and video models like LLaVA-NeXT-Video. Our experiments reveal that Gemini 1.5 Pro is the best-performing commercial model, significantly outperforming the open-source models. Our dataset along with these findings underscores the need for further improvements in handling longer sequences and multi-modal data. Project Page: https://video-mme.github.io

Abstract: Utilizing Graphic User Interface (GUI) for human-computer interaction is essential for accessing a wide range of digital tools. Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) highlight the compelling potential to develop versatile agents to help humans finish GUI navigation tasks. However, current VLMs are challenged in terms of fundamental abilities (OCR and grounding) and GUI knowledge (the functions and control methods of GUI elements), preventing them from becoming practical GUI agents. To solve these challenges, we contribute GUICourse, a suite of datasets to train visual-based GUI agents from general VLMs. First, we introduce the GUIEnv dataset to strengthen the OCR and grounding capabilities of VLMs. Then, we introduce the GUIAct and GUIChat datasets to enrich their knowledge of GUI components and interactions. Experiments demonstrate that our GUI agents have better performance on common GUI tasks than their baseline VLMs. Even the small-size GUI agent (with 3.1B parameters) can still work well on single-step and multi-step GUI tasks. Finally, we analyze the different varieties in the training stage of this agent by ablation study. Our source codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/yiye3/GUICourse.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) has become common practice, often yielding numerous copies of the same LLM differing only in their LoRA updates. This paradigm presents challenges for systems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different LoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require continuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store thousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the efficacy of compression when serving LoRAs. We propose a method for the joint compression of LoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling matrices. We extend our algorithm to learn clusters of LoRAs that are amenable to joint compression, allowing it to scale gracefully to large LoRA collections. Our experiments with up to 1000 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed LoRAs preserve performance while offering major throughput gains in realistic serving scenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 80% of the throughput of serving a single LoRA.

Abstract: The remarkable multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o underscore their necessity in practical applications, yet open-source models rarely excel in both areas. In this paper, we introduce VITA, the first-ever open-source Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at simultaneous processing and analysis of Video, Image, Text, and Audio modalities, and meanwhile has an advanced multimodal interactive experience. Starting from Mixtral 8x7B as a language foundation, we expand its Chinese vocabulary followed by bilingual instruction tuning. We further endow the language model with visual and audio capabilities through two-stage multi-task learning of multimodal alignment and instruction tuning. VITA demonstrates robust foundational capabilities of multilingual, vision, and audio understanding, as evidenced by its strong performance across a range of both unimodal and multimodal benchmarks. Beyond foundational capabilities, we have made considerable progress in enhancing the natural multimodal human-computer interaction experience. VITA is the first step for the open-source community to explore the seamless integration of multimodal understanding and interaction. While there is still lots of work to be done on VITA to get close to close-source counterparts, we hope that its role as a pioneer can serve as a cornerstone for subsequent research.

Abstract: Hallucination issues continue to affect multimodal large language models (MLLMs), with existing research mainly addressing object-level or attribute-level hallucinations, neglecting the more complex relation hallucinations that require advanced reasoning. Current benchmarks for relation hallucinations lack detailed evaluation and effective mitigation, and their datasets often suffer from biases due to systematic annotation processes. To address these challenges, we introduce Reefknot, a comprehensive benchmark targeting relation hallucinations, comprising over 20,000 real-world samples. We provide a systematic definition of relation hallucinations, integrating perceptive and cognitive perspectives, and construct a relation-based corpus using the Visual Genome scene graph dataset. Our comparative evaluation reveals significant limitations in current MLLMs' ability to handle relation hallucinations. Additionally, we propose a novel confidence-based mitigation strategy, which reduces the hallucination rate by an average of 9.75% across three datasets, including Reefknot. Our work offers valuable insights for achieving trustworthy multimodal intelligence.

<title>On the Vulnerability of Applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation within Knowledge-Intensive Application Domains</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been empirically shown to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal contexts. Given a query, RAG retrieves relevant documents from a corpus and integrates them into the LLMs' generation process. In this study, we investigate the adversarial robustness of RAG, focusing specifically on examining the retrieval system. First, across 225 different setup combinations of corpus, retriever, query, and targeted information, we show that retrieval systems are vulnerable to universal poisoning attacks in medical Q\&amp;A. In such attacks, adversaries generate poisoned documents containing a broad spectrum of targeted information, such as personally identifiable information. When these poisoned documents are inserted into a corpus, they can be accurately retrieved by any users, as long as attacker-specified queries are used. To understand this vulnerability, we discovered that the deviation from the query's embedding to that of the poisoned document tends to follow a pattern in which the high similarity between the poisoned document and the query is retained, thereby enabling precise retrieval. Based on these findings, we develop a new detection-based defense to ensure the safe use of RAG. Through extensive experiments spanning various Q\&amp;A domains, we observed that our proposed method consistently achieves excellent detection rates in nearly all cases.

Abstract: The ever-increasing size of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) renders local deployment impractical for individual users. Decentralized computing has emerged as a cost-effective solution, allowing individuals and small companies to perform LLM inference for users using surplus computational power. However, a computing provider may stealthily substitute the requested LLM with a smaller, less capable model without consent from users, thereby benefiting from cost savings. We introduce SVIP, a secret-based verifiable LLM inference protocol. Unlike existing solutions based on cryptographic or game-theoretic techniques, our method is computationally effective and does not rest on strong assumptions. Our protocol requires the computing provider to return both the generated text and processed hidden representations from LLMs. We then train a proxy task on these representations, effectively transforming them into a unique model identifier. With our protocol, users can reliably verify whether the computing provider is acting honestly. A carefully integrated secret mechanism further strengthens its security. We thoroughly analyze our protocol under multiple strong and adaptive adversarial scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SVIP is accurate, generalizable, computationally efficient, and resistant to various attacks. Notably, SVIP achieves false negative rates below 5% and false positive rates below 3%, while requiring less than 0.01 seconds per prompt query for verification.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs, particularly in language reasoning and tool integration, have rapidly sparked the \emph{Language Agents} for real-world development. Among these, travel planning represents a prominent domain, combining complex multi-objective planning challenges with practical deployment demands. However, existing benchmarks often oversimplify real-world requirements by focusing on synthetic queries and limited constraints. We address the gap of evaluating language agents in multi-day, multi-POI travel planning scenarios with diverse and open human needs. Specifically, we introduce \emph{ChinaTravel}, the first open-ended benchmark grounded in authentic Chinese travel requirements collected from 1,154 human participants. We design a compositionally generalizable domain-specific language (DSL) for scalable evaluation, covering feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and preference comparison. Empirical studies reveal the potential of neuro-symbolic agents in travel planning, achieving a 37.0\% constraint satisfaction rate on human queries, a 10\times improvement over purely neural models. These findings highlight ChinaTravel as a pivotal milestone for advancing language agents in complex, real-world planning scenarios.

Abstract: Document retrieval techniques are essential for developing large-scale information systems. The common approach involves using a bi-encoder to compute the semantic similarity between a query and documents. However, the scalar similarity often fail to reflect enough information, hindering the interpretation of retrieval results. In addition, this process primarily focuses on global semantics, overlooking the finer-grained semantic relationships between the query and the document's content. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, $\textbf{Ge}$neration $\textbf{A}$ugmented $\textbf{R}$etrieval ($\textbf{GeAR}$), which not only improves the global document-query similarity through contrastive learning, but also integrates well-designed fusion and decoding modules. This enables GeAR to generate relevant context within the documents based on a given query, facilitating learning to retrieve local fine-grained information. Furthermore, when used as a retriever, GeAR does not incur any additional computational cost over bi-encoders. GeAR exhibits competitive retrieval performance across diverse scenarios and tasks. Moreover, qualitative analysis and the results generated by GeAR provide novel insights into the interpretation of retrieval results. The code, data, and models will be released at \href{https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps}{https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps}.

<title>Latent-space adversarial training with post-aware calibration for defending large language models against jailbreak attacks</title>

Abstract: Ensuring safety alignment is a critical requirement for large language models (LLMs), particularly given increasing deployment in real-world applications. Despite considerable advancements, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which exploit system vulnerabilities to circumvent safety measures and elicit harmful or inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, while adversarial training-based defense methods have shown promise, a prevalent issue is the unintended over-defense behavior, wherein models excessively reject benign queries, significantly undermining their practical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce LATPC, a Latent-space Adversarial Training with Post-aware Calibration framework. LATPC dynamically identifies safety-critical latent dimensions by contrasting harmful and benign inputs, enabling the adaptive construction of targeted refusal feature removal attacks. This mechanism allows adversarial training to concentrate on real-world jailbreak tactics that disguise harmful queries as benign ones. During inference, LATPC employs an efficient embedding-level calibration mechanism to minimize over-defense behaviors with negligible computational overhead. Experimental results across five types of disguise-based jailbreak attacks demonstrate that LATPC achieves a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing defense frameworks. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging safety-critical dimensions in developing robust defense methods against jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Training safe LLMs remains a critical challenge. The most widely used method, Refusal Training (RT), struggles to generalize against various Out-of-Distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. Although various advanced methods have been proposed to address this issue, we instead question whether OOD attacks inherently surpass the capability of vanilla RT. Evaluations using Best-of-N (BoN) reveal significant safety improvements as N increases, indicating models possess adequate latent safety knowledge but RT fails to consistently elicit it under OOD scenarios. Further domain adaptation analysis reveals that direct RT causes reliance on superficial shortcuts, resulting in non-generalizable representation mappings. Inspired by our findings, we propose training model to perform safety reasoning for each query. Specifically, we synthesize reasoning supervision aligned with specified guidelines that reflect diverse perspectives on safety knowledge. This encourages model to engage in deeper reasoning, explicitly eliciting and utilizing latent safety knowledge for each query. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves model generalization against OOD attacks.

Abstract: As AI capabilities increasingly surpass human proficiency in complex tasks, current alignment techniques including SFT and RLHF face fundamental challenges in ensuring reliable oversight. These methods rely on direct human assessment and become untenable when AI outputs exceed human cognitive thresholds. In response to this challenge, we explore two hypotheses: (1) \textit{Critique of critique can be easier than critique itself}, extending the widely-accepted observation that verification is easier than generation to the critique domain, as critique itself is a specialized form of generation; (2) \textit{This difficulty relationship is recursively held}, suggesting that when direct evaluation is infeasible, performing high-order critiques (e.g., critique of critique of critique) offers a more tractable supervision pathway. We further conduct Human-AI and AI-AI experiments to investigate the potential of utilizing recursive self-critiquing for AI supervision. Our results highlight recursive critique as a promising approach for scalable AI oversight.

Abstract: We present a novel reasoning approach called Flow-of-Options (FoO), designed to address intrinsic biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). Flow-of-Options enables LLMs to systematically explore a diverse range of possibilities in their reasoning, as demonstrated by an FoO-based agentic framework developed for autonomously solving Machine Learning (ML) tasks. FoO enforces diversity in LLM solutions through compressed and interpretable task representations, resulting in improvements of 38.2% - 69.2% on standard data science tasks, and 37.4% - 47.9% on therapeutic chemistry tasks, as compared to state-of-the-art baselines. With an overall operation cost under $1 per task, our framework is well-suited for cost-sensitive applications. Going beyond tabular classification and regression, we show the broader applicability of our FoO-based agentic system to tasks such as reinforcement learning and image generation. Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/flagshippioneering/Flow-of-Options.

Abstract: Meeting summarization suffers from limited high-quality data, mainly due to privacy restrictions and expensive collection processes. We address this gap with FAME, a dataset of 500 meetings in English and 300 in German produced by MIMIC, our new multi-agent meeting synthesis framework that generates meeting transcripts on a given knowledge source by defining psychologically grounded participant profiles, outlining the conversation, and orchestrating a large language model (LLM) debate. A modular post-processing step refines these outputs, mitigating potential repetitiveness and overly formal tones, ensuring coherent, credible dialogues at scale. We also propose a psychologically grounded evaluation framework assessing naturalness, social behavior authenticity, and transcript difficulties. Human assessments show that FAME approximates real-meeting spontaneity (4.5/5 in naturalness), preserves speaker-centric challenges (3/5 in spoken language), and introduces richer information-oriented difficulty (4/5 in difficulty). These findings highlight that FAME is a good and scalable proxy for real-world meeting conditions. It enables new test scenarios for meeting summarization research and other conversation-centric applications in tasks requiring conversation data or simulating social scenarios under behavioral constraints.

Abstract: Scaling up executable code data is significant for improving language models' software engineering capability. The intricate nature of the process makes it labor-intensive, time-consuming and expert-knowledge-dependent to build a large number of executable code repositories, limiting the scalability of existing work based on running tests. The primary bottleneck lies in the automated building of test environments for different repositories, which is an essential yet underexplored task. To mitigate the gap, we introduce Repo2Run, the first LLM-based agent aiming at automating the building of executable test environments for any repositories at scale. Specifically, given a code repository, Repo2Run iteratively builds the Docker image, runs unit tests based on the feedback of the building, and synthesizes the Dockerfile until the entire pipeline is executed successfully. The resulting Dockerfile can then be used to create Docker container environments for running code and tests. We created a benchmark containing 420 Python repositories with unit tests for evaluation. The results illustrate that Repo2Run achieves an 86.0% success rate, outperforming SWE-agent by 77.0%. The resources of Repo2Run are available at https://github.com/bytedance/Repo2Run.

Abstract: Understanding how effectively large vision language models (VLMs) compare visual inputs is crucial across numerous applications, yet this fundamental capability remains insufficiently assessed. While VLMs are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring comparative judgment, including automated evaluation, re-ranking, and retrieval-augmented generation, no systematic framework exists to measure their performance in these scenarios. We present PairBench, a simple framework that evaluates VLMs as customizable similarity tools using widely available image datasets. Our approach introduces four key metrics for reliable comparison: alignment with human annotations, consistency across pair ordering, distribution smoothness, and controllability through prompting. Our analysis reveals that no model consistently excels across all metrics, with each demonstrating distinct strengths and weaknesses. Most concerning is the widespread inability of VLMs to maintain symmetric similarity scores. Interestingly, we demonstrate that performance on our benchmark strongly correlates with popular benchmarks used for more complex tasks, while providing additional metrics into controllability, smoothness and ordering. This makes PairBench a unique and comprehensive framework to evaluate the performance of VLMs for automatic evaluation depending on the task.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is crucial for deploying large language models (LLMs) in dynamic real-world environments without costly retraining. While recent model ensemble and model merging methods guided by parameter importance have gained popularity, they often struggle to balance knowledge transfer and forgetting, mainly due to the reliance on static importance estimates during sequential training. In this paper, we present Recurrent-KIF, a novel CL framework for Recurrent Knowledge Identification and Fusion, which enables dynamic estimation of parameter importance distributions to enhance knowledge transfer. Inspired by human continual learning, Recurrent-KIF employs an inner loop that rapidly adapts to new tasks while identifying important parameters, coupled with an outer loop that globally manages the fusion of new and historical knowledge through redundant knowledge pruning and key knowledge merging. These inner-outer loops iteratively perform multiple rounds of fusion, allowing Recurrent-KIF to leverage intermediate training information and adaptively adjust fusion strategies based on evolving importance distributions. Extensive experiments on two CL benchmarks with various model sizes (from 770M to 13B) demonstrate that Recurrent-KIF effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.

Abstract: The evaluation of machine-generated image captions is a complex and evolving challenge. With the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), image captioning has become a core task, increasing the need for robust and reliable evaluation metrics. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of advancements in image captioning evaluation, analyzing the evolution, strengths, and limitations of existing metrics. We assess these metrics across multiple dimensions, including correlation with human judgment, ranking accuracy, and sensitivity to hallucinations. Additionally, we explore the challenges posed by the longer and more detailed captions generated by MLLMs and examine the adaptability of current metrics to these stylistic variations. Our analysis highlights some limitations of standard evaluation approaches and suggests promising directions for future research in image captioning assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content, posing significant challenges for applications where factuality is crucial. While existing hallucination detection methods typically operate at the sentence level or passage level, we propose FactSelfCheck, a novel black-box sampling-based method that enables fine-grained fact-level detection. Our approach represents text as knowledge graphs consisting of facts in the form of triples. Through analyzing factual consistency across multiple LLM responses, we compute fine-grained hallucination scores without requiring external resources or training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that FactSelfCheck performs competitively with leading sentence-level sampling-based methods while providing more detailed insights. Most notably, our fact-level approach significantly improves hallucination correction, achieving a 35.5% increase in factual content compared to the baseline, while sentence-level SelfCheckGPT yields only a 10.6% improvement. The granular nature of our detection enables more precise identification and correction of hallucinated content. Additionally, we contribute a new dataset for evaluating sampling-based methods - FavaMultiSamples.

<title>Expanding the Boundaries of Vision Prior Knowledge in Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Does the prior knowledge of the vision encoder constrain the capability boundary of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)? While most existing research treats MLLMs as unified systems optimized through end-to-end training, the impact of vision encoder's prior knowledge is seldom investigated. In this work, we introduce a novel metric, $Rank_e$, to quantify the effect of prior knowledge of the vision encoder on MLLM performance. Our analysis reveals a positive correlation between prior knowledge and MLLM performance. Moreover, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning using solely end-to-end visual question answering (VQA) data is insufficient, particularly for entities with low inherent visual prior knowledge. To address this issue, we propose VisPRE (Vision Prior Remediation), a two-stage training framework that explicitly incorporates prior knowledge at the vision encoder level. Experimental results demonstrate that augmenting vision encoder's prior knowledge substantially boosts the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs, offering a novel and effective strategy for improving performance, especially in scenarios involving uncommon visual entities.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained models has become an effective strategy in artificial intelligence, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to training models from scratch. In the context of remote sensing (RS), where visual grounding(VG) remains underexplored, this approach enables the deployment of powerful vision-language models to achieve robust cross-modal understanding while significantly reducing computational overhead. To address this, we applied Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) techniques to adapt these models for RS-specific VG tasks. Specifically, we evaluated LoRA placement across different modules in Grounding DINO and used BitFit and adapters to fine-tune the OFA foundation model pre-trained on general-purpose VG datasets. This approach achieved performance comparable to or surpassing current State Of The Art (SOTA) models while significantly reducing computational costs. This study highlights the potential of PEFT techniques to advance efficient and precise multi-modal analysis in RS, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to full model training.

<title>AgentNet: Decentralized Evolutionary Coordination for LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development of multi-agent systems where multiple LLM-based agents collaborate on complex tasks. However, existing systems often rely on centralized coordination, leading to scalability bottlenecks, reduced adaptability, and single points of failure. Privacy and proprietary knowledge concerns further hinder cross-organizational collaboration, resulting in siloed expertise. We propose AgentNet, a decentralized, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that enables LLM-based agents to specialize, evolve, and collaborate autonomously in a dynamically structured Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Unlike prior approaches with static roles or centralized control, AgentNet allows agents to adjust connectivity and route tasks based on local expertise and context. AgentNet introduces three key innovations: (1) a fully decentralized coordination mechanism that eliminates the need for a central orchestrator, enhancing robustness and emergent intelligence; (2) dynamic agent graph topology that adapts in real time to task demands, ensuring scalability and resilience; and (3) a retrieval-based memory system for agents that supports continual skill refinement and specialization. By minimizing centralized control and data exchange, AgentNet enables fault-tolerant, privacy-preserving collaboration across organizations. Experiments show that AgentNet achieves higher task accuracy than both single-agent and centralized multi-agent baselines.

Abstract: Model diffing is the study of how fine-tuning changes a model's representations and internal algorithms. Many behaviors of interest are introduced during fine-tuning, and model diffing offers a promising lens to interpret such behaviors. Crosscoders are a recent model diffing method that learns a shared dictionary of interpretable concepts represented as latent directions in both the base and fine-tuned models, allowing us to track how concepts shift or emerge during fine-tuning. Notably, prior work has observed concepts with no direction in the base model, and it was hypothesized that these model-specific latents were concepts introduced during fine-tuning. However, we identify two issues which stem from the crosscoders L1 training loss that can misattribute concepts as unique to the fine-tuned model, when they really exist in both models. We develop Latent Scaling to flag these issues by more accurately measuring each latent's presence across models. In experiments comparing Gemma 2 2B base and chat models, we observe that the standard crosscoder suffers heavily from these issues. Building on these insights, we train a crosscoder with BatchTopK loss and show that it substantially mitigates these issues, finding more genuinely chat-specific and highly interpretable concepts. We recommend practitioners adopt similar techniques. Using the BatchTopK crosscoder, we successfully identify a set of chat-specific latents that are both interpretable and causally effective, representing concepts such as $\textit{false information}$ and $\textit{personal question}$, along with multiple refusal-related latents that show nuanced preferences for different refusal triggers. Overall, our work advances best practices for the crosscoder-based methodology for model diffing and demonstrates that it can provide concrete insights into how chat-tuning modifies model behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating coherent text, understanding context, and performing reasoning tasks. However, they struggle with temporal reasoning, which requires processing time-related information such as event sequencing, durations, and inter-temporal relationships. These capabilities are critical for applications including question answering, scheduling, and historical analysis. In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including out-of-distribution test sets, and reveal that TISER enables smaller open-source models to surpass larger closed-weight models on challenging temporal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Song generation focuses on producing controllable high-quality songs based on various prompts. However, existing methods struggle to generate vocals and accompaniments with prompt-based control and proper alignment. Additionally, they fall short in supporting various tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3) Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies, contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that VersBand performs better over baseline models across multiple song generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics. Audio samples are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/VersBandDemo.

Abstract: Diabetes is a civilization chronic disease characterized by a constant elevated concentration of glucose in the blood. Many processes are involved in the glucose regulation, and their interactions are very complex. To better understand those processes we set ourselves a goal to create a Petri net model of the glucose regulation in the whole body. So far we have managed to create a model of glycolysis and synthesis of glucose in the liver, and the general overview models of the glucose regulation in a healthy and diabetic person. In this paper we introduce Petri nets models of insulin secretion in beta cell of the pancreas, and glucagon in the pancreas alpha cells. Those two hormones have mutually opposite effects: insulin preventing hyperglycemia, and glucagon preventing hypoglycemia. Understanding the mechanisms of insulin and glucagon secretion constitutes the basis for understanding diabetes. We also present a model in which both processes occur together, depending on the blood glucose level. The dynamics of each model is analysed. Additionally, we transform the overall insulin and glucagon secretion system to a Boolean network, following standard transformation rules.

Abstract: Training high-quality CLIP models typically requires enormous datasets, which limits the development of domain-specific models -- especially in areas that even the largest CLIP models do not cover well -- and drives up training costs. This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data. Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living organisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet, a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.

<title>X-Transfer Attacks: Towards Super Transferable Adversarial Attacks on CLIP</title>

Abstract: As Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are increasingly adopted for diverse downstream tasks and integrated into large vision-language models (VLMs), their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations has emerged as a critical concern. In this work, we introduce \textbf{X-Transfer}, a novel attack method that exposes a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP. X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of deceiving various CLIP encoders and downstream VLMs across different samples, tasks, and domains. We refer to this property as \textbf{super transferability}--a single perturbation achieving cross-data, cross-domain, cross-model, and cross-task adversarial transferability simultaneously. This is achieved through \textbf{surrogate scaling}, a key innovation of our approach. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed surrogate models, which are computationally intensive to scale, X-Transfer employs an efficient surrogate scaling strategy that dynamically selects a small subset of suitable surrogates from a large search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that X-Transfer significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art UAP methods, establishing a new benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/HanxunH/XTransferBench}{GitHub repository}.

Abstract: This study formalizes a computational model to simulate classical Persian poets' dynamics of influence through constructing a multi-dimensional similarity network. Using a rigorously curated dataset based on Ganjoor's corpus, we draw upon semantic, lexical, stylistic, thematic, and metrical features to demarcate each poet's corpus. Each is contained within weighted similarity matrices, which are then appended to generate an aggregate graph showing poet-to-poet influence. Further network investigation is carried out to identify key poets, style hubs, and bridging poets by calculating degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector, and Katz centrality measures. Further, for typological insight, we use the Louvain community detection algorithm to demarcate clusters of poets sharing both style and theme coherence, which correspond closely to acknowledged schools of literature like Sabk-e Hindi, Sabk-e Khorasani, and the Bazgasht-e Adabi phenomenon. Our findings provide a new data-driven view of Persian literature distinguished between canonical significance and interextual influence, thus highlighting relatively lesser-known figures who hold great structural significance. Combining computational linguistics with literary study, this paper produces an interpretable and scalable model for poetic tradition, enabling retrospective reflection as well as forward-looking research within digital humanities.

Abstract: Accuracy remains a standard metric for evaluating AI systems, but it offers limited insight into how models arrive at their solutions. In this work, we introduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to probe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use. Brainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with multiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight or a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language models (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on correctness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We investigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the brainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2) generating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting solutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of solutions; and (5) making use of hints. We find that LLMs are in many cases able to find creative, insightful solutions to brainteasers, suggesting that they capture some of the capacities needed to solve novel problems in creative ways. Nonetheless, there also remain situations where they rely on brute force despite the availability of more efficient, creative solutions, highlighting a potential direction for improvement in the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: While subgroup disparities and performance bias are increasingly studied in computational research, fairness in categorical Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on explicit demographic labels, which are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we introduce an Implicit Demography Inference (IDI) module that leverages pseudo-labeling from a pre-trained model and unsupervised learning using k-means clustering to mitigate bias in SER. Our experiments show that pseudo-labeling IDI reduces subgroup disparities, improving fairness metrics by over 28% with less than a 2% decrease in SER accuracy. Also, the unsupervised IDI yields more than a 4.6% improvement in fairness metrics with a drop of less than 3.6% in SER performance. Further analyses reveal that the unsupervised IDI consistently mitigates race and age disparities, demonstrating its potential when explicit demographic information is unavailable.

Abstract: While multimodal data sources are increasingly available from real-world forecasting, most existing research remains on unimodal time series. In this work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal time series forecasting research.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong, small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% / +17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks (e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition, extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains. Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

<title>Safety Alignment Can Be Not Superficial With Explicit Safety Signals</title>

Abstract: Recent studies on the safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) have revealed that existing approaches often operate superficially, leaving models vulnerable to various adversarial attacks. Despite their significance, these studies generally fail to offer actionable solutions beyond data augmentation for achieving more robust safety mechanisms. This paper identifies a fundamental cause of this superficiality: existing alignment approaches often presume that models can implicitly learn a safety-related reasoning task during the alignment process, enabling them to refuse harmful requests. However, the learned safety signals are often diluted by other competing objectives, leading models to struggle with drawing a firm safety-conscious decision boundary when confronted with adversarial attacks. Based on this observation, by explicitly introducing a safety-related binary classification task and integrating its signals with our attention and decoding strategies, we eliminate this ambiguity and allow models to respond more responsibly to malicious queries. We emphasize that, with less than 0.2x overhead cost, our approach enables LLMs to assess the safety of both the query and the previously generated tokens at each necessary generating step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the resilience of LLMs against various adversarial attacks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust generative AI systems.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved strong results on coding and math benchmarks that are challenging for humans, yet their ability to perform tasks that come naturally to humans--such as perception, spatial navigation, and memory management--remains understudied. Real video games are crafted to be intuitive for humans to learn and master by leveraging innate inductive biases, making them an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities in VLMs. To this end, we introduce VideoGameBench, a benchmark consisting of 10 popular video games from the 1990s that VLMs directly interact with in real-time. VideoGameBench challenges models to complete entire games with access to only raw visual inputs and a high-level description of objectives and controls, a significant departure from existing setups that rely on game-specific scaffolding and auxiliary information. We keep three of the games secret to encourage solutions that generalize to unseen environments. Our experiments show that frontier vision-language models struggle to progress beyond the beginning of each game. We find inference latency to be a major limitation of frontier models in the real-time setting; therefore, we introduce VideoGameBench Lite, a setting where the game pauses while waiting for the LM's next action. The best performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, completes only 0.48% of VideoGameBench and 1.6% of VideoGameBench Lite. We hope that the formalization of the human skills mentioned above into this benchmark motivates progress in these research directions.

<div> Keywords: Preference mechanisms, Concept-based explanations, Large language models, Hierarchical Multi-Domain Regression, Explainability

Summary:
Preference mechanisms play a crucial role in evaluating and aligning large language models (LLMs), but the underlying driving concepts are not well understood. This work introduces an automated method for generating concept-based explanations of preferences in various domains. By utilizing an LLM to identify distinguishing concepts and representing them with vectors, the proposed method achieves strong preference prediction performance. A white-box Hierarchical Multi-Domain Regression model captures both domain-general and domain-specific effects in modeling the relationships between concepts and preferences. The method is evaluated with a diverse dataset across eight domains, outperforming baselines while providing explainable results. Application-driven settings show that guiding LLM outputs with concepts from explanations leads to preferred responses and prompting LaaJs with concepts improves their preference predictions, indicating a new paradigm for explainability among LLMs.

Abstract: Preference mechanisms, such as human preference, LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ), and reward models, are central to aligning and evaluating large language models (LLMs). Yet, the underlying concepts that drive these preferences remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose a fully automated method for generating local and global concept-based explanations of preferences across multiple domains. Our method utilizes an LLM to identify concepts that distinguish between chosen and rejected responses, and to represent them with concept-based vectors. To model the relationships between concepts and preferences, we propose a white-box Hierarchical Multi-Domain Regression model that captures both domain-general and domain-specific effects. To evaluate our method, we curate a dataset spanning eight challenging and diverse domains and explain twelve mechanisms. Our method achieves strong preference prediction performance, outperforming baselines while also being explainable. Additionally, we assess explanations in two application-driven settings. First, guiding LLM outputs with concepts from LaaJ explanations yields responses that those judges consistently prefer. Second, prompting LaaJs with concepts explaining humans improves their preference predictions. Together, our work establishes a new paradigm for explainability in the era of LLMs.

Summary: REAL is a reinforcement learning framework designed to improve the quality of code generated by large language models (LLMs) by addressing security and maintainability issues. The framework integrates program analysis and unit tests to provide feedback to the models, without the need for manual intervention. Unlike existing methods, REAL does not rely on labor-intensive annotations, making it scalable and effective. Experimental results show that REAL outperforms current approaches in generating functional and high-quality code. This framework bridges the gap between fast prototype development and production-ready code, allowing LLMs to deliver both speed and quality. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Code generation with large language models (LLMs), often termed vibe coding, is increasingly adopted in production but fails to ensure code quality, particularly in security (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities) and maintainability (e.g., missing type annotations). Existing methods, such as supervised fine-tuning and rule-based post-processing, rely on labor-intensive annotations or brittle heuristics, limiting their scalability and effectiveness. We propose REAL, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes LLMs to generate production-quality code using program analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals: (1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales demonstrate that REAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simultaneous assessments of functionality and code quality. Our work bridges the gap between rapid prototyping and production-ready code, enabling LLMs to deliver both speed and quality.

Abstract: Climate Finance Bench introduces an open benchmark that targets question-answering over corporate climate disclosures using Large Language Models. We curate 33 recent sustainability reports in English drawn from companies across all 11 GICS sectors and annotate 330 expert-validated question-answer pairs that span pure extraction, numerical reasoning, and logical reasoning. Building on this dataset, we propose a comparison of RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) approaches. We show that the retriever's ability to locate passages that actually contain the answer is the chief performance bottleneck. We further argue for transparent carbon reporting in AI-for-climate applications, highlighting advantages of techniques such as Weight Quantization.

<div> curriculum learning, multi-token prediction, pre-training objective, language models, downstream performance

Summary:
The article introduces multi-token prediction (MTP) as a pre-training objective for language models, aiming to predict multiple tokens at each step instead of just the next token. While MTP has shown benefits for large models, smaller language models (SLMs) have struggled with this objective. To address this, the authors propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP training, including forward and reverse curricula. The forward curriculum gradually increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from predicting the next token to predicting multiple tokens, enabling SLMs to improve downstream performance and generative output quality. On the other hand, the reverse curriculum focuses on enhancing NTP performance and output quality but fails to provide speculative decoding benefits. Overall, the forward curriculum proves to be effective in helping SLMs leverage the MTP objective during pre-training. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.

The article introduces FAMA, a family of open science Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) for English and Italian, trained on over 150k hours of open-source speech data. It also includes a new dataset with 16k hours of cleaned and pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. FAMA shows competitive performance with existing SFMs and is up to 8 times faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under open-source compliant licenses to promote openness in speech technology research.

Abstract: The development of speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper and SeamlessM4T has significantly advanced the field of speech processing. However, their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data. Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under OS-compliant licenses, promoting openness in speech technology research.

Summary:<br /><br />
- Sentence stress is significant for conveying meaning and speaker intent in spoken language.
- Recent advancements in speech-aware language models allow for direct processing of audio signals.
- StressTest is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate models' ability to distinguish interpretations based on stress patterns.
- Leading SLMs perform poorly on sentence stress tasks but show improvement when trained with a synthetic dataset, Stress17k.
- The StresSLM model, finetuned with the synthetic dataset, outperforms existing models on sentence stress reasoning and detection tasks. <div>
arXiv:2505.22765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated. Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model, StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress reasoning and detection tasks.

Summary:
This study explores the incorporation of feedback-oriented annotations to enhance automated essay scoring accuracy using the PERSUADE corpus. Two types of annotations, targeting spelling/grammar errors and argumentative elements, are integrated into the scoring pipeline. By utilizing two language models - a generative model for spell-correction and an encoder-based token classifier for argument identification - improvements in performance are demonstrated. The approach showcases the potential benefits of leveraging feedback-driven annotations in real-world scenarios for automated essay scoring tasks. Overall, the study highlights the effectiveness of incorporating feedback-oriented annotations in the scoring process, particularly through the use of encoder-based language models fine-tuned as classifiers. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Study integrates feedback-oriented annotations for improved automated essay scoring

Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES). This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting, and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language model used for spell-correction and an encoder-based token classifier trained to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

<div> Approach, Dependency-parsed corpora, Syntactic structures, Speech, Writing  
Summary:  
This paper introduces a new method for comparing syntactic structures in speech and writing using dependency-parsed corpora. The study focuses on English and Slovenian languages and defines syntactic structures as delexicalized dependency trees extracted from spoken and written Universal Dependencies treebanks. The analysis reveals that spoken corpora have fewer and less diverse syntactic structures than written ones, with distinct structural preferences across modalities. Limited overlap between spoken and written syntactic inventories suggests modality-specific syntactic organization reflecting real-time interaction and written elaboration. Keyness analysis of speech-specific structures highlights patterns related to interactivity, context-grounding, and economy of expression. The proposed framework, applicable across languages, offers a systematic approach to studying syntactic variation in corpora, laying the foundation for data-driven grammatical theories in use.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel treebank-driven approach to comparing syntactic structures in speech and writing using dependency-parsed corpora. Adopting a fully inductive, bottom-up method, we define syntactic structures as delexicalized dependency (sub)trees and extract them from spoken and written Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks in two syntactically distinct languages, English and Slovenian. For each corpus, we analyze the size, diversity, and distribution of syntactic inventories, their overlap across modalities, and the structures most characteristic of speech. Results show that, across both languages, spoken corpora contain fewer and less diverse syntactic structures than their written counterparts, with consistent cross-linguistic preferences for certain structural types across modalities. Strikingly, the overlap between spoken and written syntactic inventories is very limited: most structures attested in speech do not occur in writing, pointing to modality-specific preferences in syntactic organization that reflect the distinct demands of real-time interaction and elaborated writing. This contrast is further supported by a keyness analysis of the most frequent speech-specific structures, which highlights patterns associated with interactivity, context-grounding, and economy of expression. We argue that this scalable, language-independent framework offers a useful general method for systematically studying syntactic variation across corpora, laying the groundwork for more comprehensive data-driven theories of grammar in use.

This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated framework for generating diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. It uses state-of-the-art LLMs to create multilingual dialogues and evaluates chatbot performance. It highlights cross-lingual performance differences and curates a new meta-evaluation benchmark with human-annotated samples. The study reveals that current LLMs struggle to detect nuanced issues, especially related to empathy and reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2505.22777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the capabilities of chatbots and their underlying LLMs continue to dramatically improve, evaluating their performance has increasingly become a major blocker to their further development. A major challenge is the available benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues, conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.

Summary: 
The study evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to match conclusions of expert-conducted systematic reviews (SRs). The MedEvidence benchmark pairs findings from 100 SRs with the studies they are based on and evaluates 24 LLMs. Results show that reasoning does not necessarily improve performance, larger models do not consistently yield better results, and knowledge-based fine-tuning degrades accuracy. Most models exhibit similar behavior, with performance degradation as token length increases, overconfidence in responses, and a lack of scientific skepticism toward low-quality findings. The study highlights the need for further research before LLMs can reliably match expert-conducted SRs, despite current deployment and usage by clinicians. The codebase and benchmark are released to the research community for further investigation. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.22787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic reviews (SR), in which experts summarize and analyze evidence across individual studies to provide insights on a specialized topic, are a cornerstone for evidence-based clinical decision-making, research, and policy. Given the exponential growth of scientific articles, there is growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to automate SR generation. However, the ability of LLMs to critically assess evidence and reason across multiple documents to provide recommendations at the same proficiency as domain experts remains poorly characterized. We therefore ask: Can LLMs match the conclusions of systematic reviews written by clinical experts when given access to the same studies? To explore this question, we present MedEvidence, a benchmark pairing findings from 100 SRs with the studies they are based on. We benchmark 24 LLMs on MedEvidence, including reasoning, non-reasoning, medical specialist, and models across varying sizes (from 7B-700B). Through our systematic evaluation, we find that reasoning does not necessarily improve performance, larger models do not consistently yield greater gains, and knowledge-based fine-tuning degrades accuracy on MedEvidence. Instead, most models exhibit similar behavior: performance tends to degrade as token length increases, their responses show overconfidence, and, contrary to human experts, all models show a lack of scientific skepticism toward low-quality findings. These results suggest that more work is still required before LLMs can reliably match the observations from expert-conducted SRs, even though these systems are already deployed and being used by clinicians. We release our codebase and benchmark to the broader research community to further investigate LLM-based SR systems.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new approach to Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) that considers the unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel relation instances instead of assuming all instances are novel. The proposed MixORE framework combines relation classification and clustering to simultaneously learn known and novel relations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that MixORE outperforms existing methods in identifying known relation classifications and clustering novel relations. This approach enhances the research in generalized OpenRE and has practical implications for real-world applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) seeks to identify and extract novel relational facts between named entities from unlabeled data without pre-defined relation schemas. Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances. To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications.

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of overhearing agents, which are AI agents that listen in on human conversations and provide background assistance. The study focuses on using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents in Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. Through a human evaluation, the research examines the effectiveness of these agents in assisting a Dungeon Master. The results show that some audio-language models can perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Additionally, the project code and Python libraries are released to support further exploration of the overhearing agents paradigm. This alternative approach to interacting with AI agents opens up new possibilities for enhancing human-to-human conversations and tasks. <div>
arXiv:2505.22809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework called SR-NLE that allows large language models to improve the faithfulness of their own natural language explanations. This framework enables models to iteratively critique and refine their explanations without external supervision. It leverages different feedback mechanisms including natural language self-feedback and a novel feature attribution approach. Experimental results across three datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs show that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with the best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate reduction of 18.79% compared to the baseline. This indicates that LLMs can refine their explanations to better represent their reasoning process with appropriate guidance through feedback, without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.22823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), natural language explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs -- through an iterative critique and refinement process without external supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to 54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Evaluation benchmarks, Reasoning over-text, Reading comprehension datasets, Crowdsourcing

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are being used for data generation, but creating evaluation benchmarks for them is challenging. This study investigates if LLMs can meet benchmark requirements by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks. Two high-quality reading comprehension datasets were evaluated: CondaQA for reasoning about negation and DROP for reasoning about quantities. LLM-generated versions were found to be valid according to annotation guidelines but less challenging for LLMs compared to human-authored benchmarks. While LLMs can produce valid benchmarks at a lower cost, the lack of challenge raises concerns about using LLMs for benchmark creation. This study highlights the importance of critically reassessing the use of LLMs for generating evaluation data. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large language models are used for data generation, but creating challenging evaluation benchmarks is essential. This study compares LLM-generated versions of reading comprehension datasets to human-authored benchmarks, finding LLM-generated benchmarks to be valid but less challenging for LLMs. This raises concerns about the use of LLMs for benchmark creation and emphasizes the need to reconsider the prevalent approach. <div>
arXiv:2505.22830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data generation. However, creating evaluation benchmarks raises the bar for this emerging paradigm. Benchmarks must target specific phenomena, penalize exploiting shortcuts, and be challenging. Through two case studies, we investigate whether LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the original crowdsourcing effort. However, we show that they are less challenging for LLMs than their human-authored counterparts. This finding sheds light on what may have been lost by generating evaluation data with LLMs, and calls for critically reassessing the immediate use of this increasingly prevalent approach to benchmark creation.

<div> Bayesian, Attention Mechanism, Transformer, language models, positional encoding <br /> 
<br />Summary: <br /> 
The article introduces the Bayesian Attention Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that incorporates positional encoding as a prior in a probabilistic model for Transformer-based language models. BAM unifies existing methods and introduces a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that enhances long-context generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that BAM enables accurate information retrieval at significantly increased training context lengths, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods in long context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and minimal additional parameters. <div>

Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length, outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and introducing minimal additional parameters.

<div> Highlighting, Human Label Variation, Natural Language Inference, Annotation, Taxonomy
Summary: The study addresses the issue of within-label variation in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and introduces a linguistically-informed taxonomy called LITEX to categorize free-text explanations. By annotating a subset of the e-SNLI dataset using LITEX, the researchers validate its reliability and analyze its alignment with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. The taxonomy also proves useful in generating explanations, showing that conditioning generation on LITEX produces linguistically closer explanations to human reasoning compared to existing strategies. This approach not only captures within-label variation in NLI but also bridges the gap between human and model explanations effectively. <div>
arXiv:2505.22848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for categorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

Abstract: The proliferation of online news and the increasing spread of misinformation necessitate robust methods for automatic data analysis. Narrative classification is emerging as a important task, since identifying what is being said online is critical for fact-checkers, policy markers and other professionals working on information studies. This paper presents our approach to SemEval 2025 Task 10 Subtask 2, which aims to classify news articles into a pre-defined two-level taxonomy of main narratives and sub-narratives across multiple languages.
  We propose Hierarchical Three-Step Prompting (H3Prompt) for multilingual narrative classification. Our methodology follows a three-step Large Language Model (LLM) prompting strategy, where the model first categorises an article into one of two domains (Ukraine-Russia War or Climate Change), then identifies the most relevant main narratives, and finally assigns sub-narratives. Our approach secured the top position on the English test set among 28 competing teams worldwide. The code is available at https://github.com/GateNLP/H3Prompt.

<div> Keywords: Large Reasoning Models, multilingual reasoning, XReasoning benchmark, prompt based interventions, post training

Summary: 
Multilingual reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are found to be limited, with models often reverting to English or producing fragmented reasoning in other languages. The study evaluates LRMs on the XReasoning benchmark and highlights a substantial gap in multilingual reasoning. Prompt-based interventions that force models to reason in the user's language improve readability and oversight but decrease answer accuracy, indicating a trade-off. Targeted post-training on just 100 examples helps mitigate this mismatch, but some accuracy loss remains. The results emphasize the importance of considering multilingual reasoning in LRMs for real-world applications and suggest directions for future research. The code and data for the study are available on GitHub at https://github.com/Betswish/mCoT-XReasoning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with thinking traces have shown strong performance on English reasoning tasks. However, their ability to think in other languages is less studied. This capability is as important as answer accuracy for real world applications because users may find the reasoning trace useful for oversight only when it is expressed in their own language. We comprehensively evaluate two leading families of LRMs on our XReasoning benchmark and find that even the most advanced models often revert to English or produce fragmented reasoning in other languages, revealing a substantial gap in multilingual reasoning. Prompt based interventions that force models to reason in the users language improve readability and oversight but reduce answer accuracy, exposing an important trade off. We further show that targeted post training on just 100 examples mitigates this mismatch, though some accuracy loss remains. Our results highlight the limited multilingual reasoning capabilities of current LRMs and outline directions for future work.

The study focuses on bias in vision-language models (VLMs) and introduces a new benchmark called VIGNETTE to evaluate bias. The benchmark includes 30M+ images and covers four aspects: factuality, perception, stereotyping, and decision making. The research explores how VLMs interpret identities in contextualized settings and examines how they make trait and capability assumptions, revealing patterns of discrimination. Drawing from social psychology, the study analyzes how VLMs connect visual identity cues to biased inferences, encoding social hierarchies. The findings uncover subtle and multifaceted stereotypical patterns, shedding light on how VLMs construct social meaning from inputs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While bias in large language models (LLMs) is well-studied, similar concerns in vision-language models (VLMs) have received comparatively less attention. Existing VLM bias studies often focus on portrait-style images and gender-occupation associations, overlooking broader and more complex social stereotypes and their implied harm. This work introduces VIGNETTE, a large-scale VQA benchmark with 30M+ images for evaluating bias in VLMs through a question-answering framework spanning four directions: factuality, perception, stereotyping, and decision making. Beyond narrowly-centered studies, we assess how VLMs interpret identities in contextualized settings, revealing how models make trait and capability assumptions and exhibit patterns of discrimination. Drawing from social psychology, we examine how VLMs connect visual identity cues to trait and role-based inferences, encoding social hierarchies, through biased selections. Our findings uncover subtle, multifaceted, and surprising stereotypical patterns, offering insights into how VLMs construct social meaning from inputs.

<div> Attribution Theory, social psychology, implicit cognition, biases, LLMs<br />
Summary: <br />
This article delves into the topic of Attribution Theory and how it impacts perceptions and decisions when assigning reasons for event outcomes. It explores how individuals tend to attribute failures or successes to internal factors like effort or ability, or external factors such as task difficulty or luck. The study focuses on how biases in LLMs (Large Language Models) can impact demographic groups, highlighting the importance of fairness in such assessments. Unlike previous works that solely examine surface-level biases or stereotypes, this research proposes a cognitive bias evaluation framework to identify how reasoning disparities in models affect different demographic groups. By understanding how LLMs assign attribution to event outcomes, we can better uncover and address biases that may perpetuate inequalities within these systems. <div>

Abstract: When a student fails an exam, do we tend to blame their effort or the test's difficulty? Attribution, defined as how reasons are assigned to event outcomes, shapes perceptions, reinforces stereotypes, and influences decisions. Attribution Theory in social psychology explains how humans assign responsibility for events using implicit cognition, attributing causes to internal (e.g., effort, ability) or external (e.g., task difficulty, luck) factors. LLMs' attribution of event outcomes based on demographics carries important fairness implications. Most works exploring social biases in LLMs focus on surface-level associations or isolated stereotypes. This work proposes a cognitively grounded bias evaluation framework to identify how models' reasoning disparities channelize biases toward demographic groups.

This paper introduces ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning and decision-making in the emergency room (ER) setting. The benchmark includes data from 3,984 patients with various types of clinical notes and covers key stages of the ER workflow such as triage intake, treatment selection, and final diagnosis. Evaluation tasks are structured to reflect core clinical reasoning processes like differential diagnosis via rule-out reasoning. The benchmark also includes physician-authored rationales to mimic teaching processes used in residency training.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need for future research to bridge this divide.

<div> Keywords: large language models, long-term memory, semantic retention, contextual coherence, memory mechanisms

Summary:
This paper introduces a model architecture to address the limitations of large language models in understanding long-term context. The proposed model includes a long-term memory mechanism with explicit memory units, gated writing mechanisms, and attention-based reading modules. A forgetting function allows dynamic updates of memory content, improving the management of historical information. A joint training objective combines task loss with memory constraints to guide the model in learning better memory strategies. Evaluation across multiple subtasks shows the model's advantages in text generation consistency, stability in multi-turn question answering, and accuracy in cross-context reasoning. The model effectively handles long-term dependencies, mitigating context loss and semantic drift issues. Analysis of memory structures, capacity sizes, and control strategies confirms the critical role of memory mechanisms in language understanding. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in architectural design and performance outcomes.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large language models in understanding long-term context. It proposes a model architecture equipped with a long-term memory mechanism to improve the retention and retrieval of semantic information across paragraphs and dialogue turns. The model integrates explicit memory units, gated writing mechanisms, and attention-based reading modules. A forgetting function is introduced to enable dynamic updates of memory content, enhancing the model's ability to manage historical information. To further improve the effectiveness of memory operations, the study designs a joint training objective. This combines the main task loss with constraints on memory writing and forgetting. It guides the model to learn better memory strategies during task execution. Systematic evaluation across multiple subtasks shows that the model achieves clear advantages in text generation consistency, stability in multi-turn question answering, and accuracy in cross-context reasoning. In particular, the model demonstrates strong semantic retention and contextual coherence in long-text tasks and complex question answering scenarios. It effectively mitigates the context loss and semantic drift problems commonly faced by traditional language models when handling long-term dependencies. The experiments also include analysis of different memory structures, capacity sizes, and control strategies. These results further confirm the critical role of memory mechanisms in language understanding. They demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in both architectural design and performance outcomes.

Summary:
This paper introduces a new method called Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM) to address the issue of performance degradation in merging models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). By constraining the LoRA subspace prior to fine-tuning, OSRM ensures that updates for one task do not negatively impact outputs for others. The method seamlessly integrates with existing merging algorithms, reducing interference among tasks. Experiments on multiple datasets and language models show that OSRM improves merging performance while maintaining single-task accuracy. Additionally, it exhibits robustness to merging hyperparameters. This study emphasizes the importance of considering the interaction between data and model parameters in model merging and provides a practical solution for merging LoRA models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.22934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data distributions. We propose Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM) to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets, tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the hyperparameters of merging. These results highlight the importance of data-parameter interaction in model merging and offer a plug-and-play solution for merging LoRA models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered web agents enables automating complex, real-time web navigation tasks in enterprise environments. However, existing web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks. We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by 10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.

Summary:
The article introduces Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality (MAC) as a benchmark for evaluating compositional vulnerabilities in pre-trained multimodal representations. The benchmark utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate deceptive text samples that exploit these vulnerabilities across different modalities. A self-training approach is proposed to enhance zero-shot methods by leveraging rejection-sampling fine-tuning and diversity-promoting filtering. This approach improves attack success rate and sample diversity when using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B. The study demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities in various multimodal representations, such as images, videos, and audios. Overall, MAC provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the effectiveness of multimodal representations and highlights the importance of addressing compositional vulnerabilities in these models.

Abstract: While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and audios.

The study introduces the OWL dataset containing excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, testing model performance across languages through probing tasks. LLMs showed consistent cross-lingual memorization, successfully identifying authors and titles, predicting masked entities, and generating continuations even in newly translated texts. Perturbations like masking characters slightly reduced accuracy but did not hinder overall performance. The findings shed light on the extensive capabilities of LLMs in multilingual and cross-lingual tasks, showcasing their potential for diverse language applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text from their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili, Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages, even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6% of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the models.

Summary: 
Negation plays a crucial role in language comprehension, as it can completely reverse the meaning of a sentence. The NegVQA benchmark was introduced to assess the ability of vision language models (VLMs) to comprehend negation. This benchmark consists of 7,379 two-choice questions covering various negation scenarios and image-question distributions. Evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art VLMs across different model families revealed that these models struggle significantly with negation, showing a notable performance drop compared to their responses to non-negated questions. The study also discovered a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially leads to a decrease in performance on NegVQA before eventually leading to improvements. The NegVQA benchmark highlights critical gaps in VLMs' understanding of negation and provides valuable insights for future developments in VLM technology.

arXiv:2505.22946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future VLM development. Project page available at https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/NegVQA/.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, zero-shot summarization, document structure, StrucSum, prompting framework

Summary: 
StrucSum is a novel training-free prompting framework that enhances the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot summarization. It introduces structural signals through Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP), Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP), and Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) strategies to improve summary quality and factual consistency. Through experiments on ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News datasets, StrucSum consistently outperforms unsupervised baselines and vanilla prompting in aligning summaries with source content. Notably, on ArXiv, it significantly enhances FactCC and SummaC scores by 19.2 and 9.7 points respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of structure-aware prompting for zero-shot extractive summarization using LLMs without the need for training or task-specific tuning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot summarization, but often struggle to model document structure and identify salient information in long texts. In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and vanilla prompting. Notably, on ArXiv, it boosts FactCC and SummaC by 19.2 and 9.7 points, indicating stronger alignment between summaries and source content. These findings suggest that structure-aware prompting is a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, without any training or task-specific tuning.

<div> Keywords: argument mining, Large Language Models, online comments, automated analysis, performance evaluation

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated for their ability to analyze arguments in online comments related to polarizing topics like abortion. Performance is strong overall, especially for large and fine-tuned LLMs, but there are concerns about their effectiveness on long, nuanced comments and emotionally charged language. The study highlights the potential of LLMs for automated argument analysis but also underscores the current limitations. Environmental costs of using LLMs for this task are significant. The evaluation was conducted using datasets with over 2,000 opinion comments across six topics. Systematic shortcomings were identified, raising issues for applications like content moderation and opinion analysis. <div>

Abstract: Automated large-scale analysis of public discussions around contested issues like abortion requires detecting and understanding the use of arguments. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in language processing tasks, their performance in mining topic-specific, pre-defined arguments in online comments remains underexplored. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on three argument mining tasks using datasets comprising over 2,000 opinion comments across six polarizing topics. Quantitative evaluation suggests an overall strong performance across the three tasks, especially for large and fine-tuned LLMs, albeit at a significant environmental cost. However, a detailed error analysis revealed systematic shortcomings on long and nuanced comments and emotionally charged language, raising concerns for downstream applications like content moderation or opinion analysis. Our results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for automated argument analysis in online comments.

<div> benchmark, HSE compliance, large language models, reasoning, decision-making

Summary:<br />
The article introduces HSE-Bench, a benchmark dataset for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment. The dataset consists of over 1,000 manually curated questions related to regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, with a reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule Conclusion (IRAC). Evaluation of different LLMs shows that while they perform well, their reasoning capabilities in the HSE compliance context are limited, relying more on semantic matching than principled reasoning. The study introduces a new prompting technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), to guide LLMs in simulating expert reasoning for a more accurate decision-making process. This research aims to identify and address the reasoning gaps in LLMs for HSE compliance assessment, paving the way for further investigations in related tasks.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.22959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment demands dynamic real-time decision-making under complicated regulations and complex human-machine-environment interactions. While large language models (LLMs) hold significant potential for decision intelligence and contextual dialogue, their capacity for domain-specific knowledge in HSE and structured legal reasoning remains underexplored. We introduce HSE-Bench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the HSE compliance assessment capabilities of LLM. HSE-Bench comprises over 1,000 manually curated questions drawn from regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, and integrates a reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule Conclusion (IRAC) to assess the holistic reasoning pipeline. We conduct extensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs, including foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The results show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their capabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning grounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native reasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE compliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the reasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a more accurate unified decision. We hope our study highlights reasoning gaps in LLMs for HSE compliance and inspires further research on related tasks.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, persuasion, Theory of Mind, ToMAP, reinforcement learning

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach called Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP) to enhance the flexibility and opponent awareness of persuader agents. ToMAP incorporates theory of mind modules to improve the persuader's understanding of the opponent's mental state and generate more effective arguments. By prompting the persuader to consider possible objections and using a text encoder with a trained classifier, ToMAP outperforms larger baselines like GPT-4o by 39.4% across various persuadee models and datasets. The ToMAP persuader exhibits complex reasoning chains, reduced repetition, and utilizes opponent-aware strategies, making it suitable for long conversations and logical discussions. The results highlight the effectiveness of the ToMAP approach in developing persuasive language agents. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion, but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably, while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably, ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training, which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more persuasive language agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/ToMAP.

Summary:<br />
- This study explores the application of scaling laws in electronic health records (EHRs) using transformer models trained on patient data from the MIMIC-IV database.
- The research identifies consistent scaling patterns in EHR foundation models, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility.

Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies. Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized healthcare.

<div> verification, explainability, claim, LLMs, disambiguation

Summary:<br /><br />Claim verification is a challenging task that requires accuracy and explainability, especially with the complexity of real-world claims in the era of large language models (LLMs). The VeGraph framework addresses this by decomposing claims into structured triplets, using graph representation to integrate information, and employing entity disambiguation through interaction with a knowledge base. VeGraph verifies remaining triplets to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments with Meta-Llama-3-70B show competitive performance on HoVer and FEVEROUS benchmarks. This framework effectively tackles claim verification challenges by leveraging LLM reasoning and comprehension abilities. The code and data are available for further research and application. <div>
arXiv:2505.22993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models (LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire verification process. To address these challenges, we propose Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1) Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets, forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data are available for further exploitation.

Summary: 
The article introduces DyePack, a framework that utilizes backdoor attacks to identify models that have used benchmark test sets during training. This framework does not require access to internal model details but instead mixes backdoor samples with test data to flag potentially contaminated models. By incorporating multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, DyePack ensures exact false positive rate computation when flagging models, preventing false accusations while providing strong evidence of contamination. Evaluations on multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks show DyePack's success in detecting contaminated models with extremely low false positive rates on various datasets. <div>
arXiv:2505.23001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss, logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate (FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets, covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant improvements in various service domains, including search, recommendation, and chatbot applications. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) research to industrial settings presents challenges, as it requires maintaining flexible conversational abilities while also strictly complying with service-specific constraints. This can be seen as two conflicting requirements due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose our approach to addressing this challenge and detail the strategies we employed to overcome their inherent limitations in real-world applications. We conduct a practical case study of a conversational agent designed for the e-commerce domain, detailing our implementation workflow and optimizations. Our findings provide insights into bridging the gap between academic research and real-world application, introducing a framework for developing scalable, controllable, and reliable AI-driven agents.

<div> Keywords: LLMs, backdoor detection, TF-IDF clustering, reference-filtration, machine translation

Summary:
The study addresses the issue of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with datasets containing stealthy backdoors, which can pose security risks to downstream applications. Traditional detection methods are ineffective for generation tasks or may degrade performance. The proposed method, RFTC, combines Reference-Filtration and TF-IDF clustering to identify suspicious samples by comparing their responses to a reference model and clustering them based on intra-class distances. Experiments on machine translation and QA datasets show that RFTC outperforms baseline methods in backdoor detection and model performance. Analysis using different reference models also validates the effectiveness of the Reference-Filtration mechanism. The study provides a promising approach to efficiently eliminate stealthy poisoned samples in LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs with datasets containing stealthy backdoors from publishers poses security risks to downstream applications. Mainstream detection methods either identify poisoned samples by analyzing the prediction probability of poisoned classification models or rely on the rewriting model to eliminate the stealthy triggers. However, the former cannot be applied to generation tasks, while the latter may degrade generation performance and introduce new triggers. Therefore, efficiently eliminating stealthy poisoned samples for LLMs remains an urgent problem. We observe that after applying TF-IDF clustering to the sample response, there are notable differences in the intra-class distances between clean and poisoned samples. Poisoned samples tend to cluster closely because of their specific malicious outputs, whereas clean samples are more scattered due to their more varied responses. Thus, in this paper, we propose a stealthy backdoor sample detection method based on Reference-Filtration and Tfidf-Clustering mechanisms (RFTC). Specifically, we first compare the sample response with the reference model's outputs and consider the sample suspicious if there's a significant discrepancy. And then we perform TF-IDF clustering on these suspicious samples to identify the true poisoned samples based on the intra-class distance. Experiments on two machine translation datasets and one QA dataset demonstrate that RFTC outperforms baselines in backdoor detection and model performance. Further analysis of different reference models also confirms the effectiveness of our Reference-Filtration.

The article introduces the CHED benchmark to evaluate the context robustness of knowledge editing (KE) methods and identifies challenges when preceding contexts are present. The CoRE method is proposed to address these challenges by minimizing context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge. Evaluations on CHED show that KE methods often fail when preceding contexts are introduced. CoRE improves the editing success rate in the presence of preceding contexts while maintaining the model's overall capabilities. The study explores the impact of user utterances versus assistant responses as preceding contexts and analyzes attention-score patterns to understand how specific tokens influence editing success. <div>
arXiv:2505.23026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge. This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence editing success.

<div> Keywords: Imageability, Concreteness, Psycholinguistic properties, Unsupervised measure, Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM)

Summary: 
The study explores the relationship between imageability and concreteness in text using an unsupervised measure called Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM). The researchers propose that the peakedness of a word's neighborhood in a semantic embedding space can reflect its imageability and concreteness. Through extensive experiments, they demonstrate that NSM outperforms existing unsupervised methods in estimating these properties. The measure correlates strongly with ground-truth ratings and serves as a reliable predictor for classification tasks. The findings suggest that imageability and concreteness can be inferred from text alone without the need for parallel visual and semantic datasets. The code and data for the study are available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness (perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these properties for classification. Our code and data are available on GitHub (https://github.com/Artificial-Memory-Lab/imageability).

- The study compared four commercial clinical NLP systems and two dedicated systems for labeling pediatric chest radiograph reports.
- A total of 95,008 reports were analyzed from a pediatric hospital, extracting entities and assertion statuses.
- Significant differences were observed in the number of entities extracted and assertion distributions across the NLP systems.
- The assertion accuracy averaged around 62%, with considerable variability in performance among the systems.
- The study highlights the importance of careful validation and review before deploying NLP tools for clinical report labeling. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose clinical natural language processing (NLP) tools are increasingly used for the automatic labeling of clinical reports. However, independent evaluations for specific tasks, such as pediatric chest radiograph (CXR) report labeling, are limited. This study compares four commercial clinical NLP systems - Amazon Comprehend Medical (AWS), Google Healthcare NLP (GC), Azure Clinical NLP (AZ), and SparkNLP (SP) - for entity extraction and assertion detection in pediatric CXR reports. Additionally, CheXpert and CheXbert, two dedicated chest radiograph report labelers, were evaluated on the same task using CheXpert-defined labels. We analyzed 95,008 pediatric CXR reports from a large academic pediatric hospital. Entities and assertion statuses (positive, negative, uncertain) from the findings and impression sections were extracted by the NLP systems, with impression section entities mapped to 12 disease categories and a No Findings category. CheXpert and CheXbert extracted the same 13 categories. Outputs were compared using Fleiss Kappa and accuracy against a consensus pseudo-ground truth. Significant differences were found in the number of extracted entities and assertion distributions across NLP systems. SP extracted 49,688 unique entities, GC 16,477, AZ 31,543, and AWS 27,216. Assertion accuracy across models averaged around 62%, with SP highest (76%) and AWS lowest (50%). CheXpert and CheXbert achieved 56% accuracy. Considerable variability in performance highlights the need for careful validation and review before deploying NLP tools for clinical report labeling.

Summary: 
Machine-Facing English (MFE) is a new register influenced by human-AI interactions, characterized by syntactic rigidity, pragmatic simplification, and hyper-explicit phrasing. The study, based on bilingual testing sessions, identifies traits like redundant clarity, directive syntax, controlled vocabulary, flattened prosody, and single-intent structuring that enhance machine parseability but limit natural fluency. MFE evolution poses challenges in balancing efficiency and linguistic richness, particularly for conversational interfaces and multilingual users. The tension between these factors necessitates thorough methodological documentation and further empirical validation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-Facing English (MFE) is an emergent register shaped by the adaptation of everyday language to the expanding presence of AI interlocutors. Drawing on register theory (Halliday 1985, 2006), enregisterment (Agha 2003), audience design (Bell 1984), and interactional pragmatics (Giles & Ogay 2007), this study traces how sustained human-AI interaction normalizes syntactic rigidity, pragmatic simplification, and hyper-explicit phrasing - features that enhance machine parseability at the expense of natural fluency. Our analysis is grounded in qualitative observations from bilingual (Korean/English) voice- and text-based product testing sessions, with reflexive drafting conducted using Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) under human curation. Thematic analysis identifies five recurrent traits - redundant clarity, directive syntax, controlled vocabulary, flattened prosody, and single-intent structuring - that improve execution accuracy but compress expressive range. MFE's evolution highlights a persistent tension between communicative efficiency and linguistic richness, raising design challenges for conversational interfaces and pedagogical considerations for multilingual users. We conclude by underscoring the need for comprehensive methodological exposition and future empirical validation.

Abstract: The inherent nature of social media posts, characterized by the freedom of language use with a disjointed array of diverse opinions and topics, poses significant challenges to downstream NLP tasks such as comment clustering, comment summarization, and social media opinion analysis. To address this, we propose a granular level of identifying and generating aspect terms from individual comments to guide model attention. Specifically, we leverage multilingual large language models with supervised fine-tuning for comment aspect term generation (CAT-G), further aligning the model's predictions with human expectations through DPO. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing the comprehension of social media discourse on two NLP tasks. Moreover, this paper contributes the first multilingual CAT-G test set on English, Chinese, Malay, and Bahasa Indonesian. As LLM capabilities vary among languages, this test set allows for a comparative analysis of performance across languages with varying levels of LLM proficiency.

<div> Ensemble Learning Method, Named Entity Recognition, In-Context Learning, Large Language Models, Open-source <br />
Summary: 
The Ensemble Learning Method for Named Entity Recognition (EL4NER) leverages multiple open-source, small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve NER performance while reducing deployment and inference costs. EL4NER's task decomposition pipeline enables deep ensemble learning, aided by a novel span-level sentence similarity algorithm for ICL demonstration retrieval. A self-validation mechanism helps mitigate noise in the ensemble process. Experimental results show EL4NER outperforms closed-source, large-parameter LLM methods with fewer parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance on certain datasets. These findings highlight EL4NER's parameter efficiency and the potential of using open-source, small-parameter LLMs in the ICL framework for NER tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) technique based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained prominence in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for its lower computing resource consumption, less manual labeling overhead, and stronger generalizability. Nevertheless, most ICL-based NER methods depend on large-parameter LLMs: the open-source models demand substantial computational resources for deployment and inference, while the closed-source ones incur high API costs, raise data-privacy concerns, and hinder community collaboration. To address this question, we propose an Ensemble Learning Method for Named Entity Recognition (EL4NER), which aims at aggregating the ICL outputs of multiple open-source, small-parameter LLMs to enhance overall performance in NER tasks at less deployment and inference cost. Specifically, our method comprises three key components. First, we design a task decomposition-based pipeline that facilitates deep, multi-stage ensemble learning. Second, we introduce a novel span-level sentence similarity algorithm to establish an ICL demonstration retrieval mechanism better suited for NER tasks. Third, we incorporate a self-validation mechanism to mitigate the noise introduced during the ensemble process. We evaluated EL4NER on multiple widely adopted NER datasets from diverse domains. Our experimental results indicate that EL4NER surpasses most closed-source, large-parameter LLM-based methods at a lower parameter cost and even attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among ICL-based methods on certain datasets. These results show the parameter efficiency of EL4NER and underscore the feasibility of employing open-source, small-parameter LLMs within the ICL paradigm for NER tasks.

<div> retrieve-augmented generation, Large Language Models, routing mechanisms, document embeddings, contrastive learning

Summary:
The article introduces RAGRouter, a novel routing design for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs). It aims to address the varying response quality of LLMs under RAG by leveraging document embeddings and contrastive learning. RAGRouter dynamically incorporates external documents' influence to make informed routing decisions, improving performance significantly. Extensive experiments show RAGRouter outperforms individual LLMs and existing routing methods on knowledge-intensive tasks. It achieves an average improvement of 3.61% over the best LLM and 3.29%-9.33% over existing methods. RAGRouter also demonstrates strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under low-latency constraints with an extended score-threshold-based mechanism. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, varying response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations, exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings show that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM by 3.61% on average and existing routing methods by 3.29%-9.33%. With an extended score-threshold-based mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under low-latency constraints.

Summary: 
Small language models have challenges in exhibiting reflective revision behavior in self-correction paradigms. To address this, the CoCoS approach is introduced, utilizing online reinforcement learning to enhance the capability of small models for multi-turn code correction. The approach incorporates an accumulated reward function and fine-grained rewards to train the model to maintain correct outputs confidently while improving incorrect outputs over successive turns. CoCoS achieves significant improvements on MBPP and HumanEval benchmarks compared to baselines with 1B-scale models. This work sheds light on enhancing the self-correction ability of smaller language models for code generation tasks. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With 1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on HumanEval compared to the baselines.

arXiv:2505.23065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing integration of visual and textual content in Social Networking Services (SNS), evaluating the multimodal capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing user experience, content understanding, and platform intelligence. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on text-centric tasks, lacking coverage of the multimodal contexts prevalent in modern SNS ecosystems. In this paper, we introduce SNS-Bench-VL, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to assess the performance of Vision-Language LLMs in real-world social media scenarios. SNS-Bench-VL incorporates images and text across 8 multimodal tasks, including note comprehension, user engagement analysis, information retrieval, and personalized recommendation. It comprises 4,001 carefully curated multimodal question-answer pairs, covering single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended tasks. We evaluate over 25 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, analyzing their performance across tasks. Our findings highlight persistent challenges in multimodal social context comprehension. We hope SNS-Bench-VL will inspire future research towards robust, context-aware, and human-aligned multimodal intelligence for next-generation social networking services.

<div> decoding, document-level text generation, Minimum Bayes Risk, MBR-OT, Wasserstein distance

Summary:
Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding is adapted for document-level text generation tasks. MBR-OT, a variant using Wasserstein distance, is proposed to compute document utility with a sentence-level function. This approach outperforms standard MBR in machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks. The utility function estimation for document-level tasks is challenging, as existing ones are tailored for sentences. However, by utilizing Wasserstein distance in MBR-OT, a more effective utility computation for documents is achieved. The code for this study is available on GitHub for replication and further research. <div>
arXiv:2505.23078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document-level text generation tasks are known to be more difficult than sentence-level text generation tasks as they require the understanding of longer context to generate high-quality texts. In this paper, we investigate the adaption of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs. Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text generation tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks.

Summary: 
- The study focuses on using Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating training data to enhance zero or few-shot NLP tasks, specifically Relation Extraction (RE).
- Directly prompting LLMs for sample generation can result in high structural similarities among samples, limiting the variety of phrasing used to express relations between entities.
- The research explores methods to increase diversity in training samples generated by LLMs for RE while ensuring correctness.
- In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts are used to encourage the production of dissimilar samples by LLMs.
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is introduced as an approach to fine-tune LLMs for generating diverse training samples.
- Experimental results on RE datasets indicate that both strategies improve the quality of generated training data.
- Comparing the performance of training a non-LLM RE model with LLM-generated samples suggests potential performance improvements by using the latter. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate training data can potentially be a preferable way to improve zero or few-shot NLP tasks. However, many problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts. Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated samples may lead to better performance.

<div> Keywords: preference data, large language models, GPT-4o, alignment scores, data efficiency

Summary:
The article introduces the Alignment Data Map, a tool that utilizes GPT-4o to analyze preference data for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. By computing alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to preference datasets, the tool constructs an Alignment Data Map based on mean and variance. Using only a fraction of the data, the tool identifies high-quality samples for LLM alignment, improving data collection efficiency without the need for explicit annotations. The Alignment Data Map can also diagnose existing preference datasets by detecting low-impact or misannotated samples. The experiments demonstrate that utilizing samples in the high-mean, low-variance region achieves comparable or superior performance to using the entire dataset. This innovative approach presents a promising solution to the scalability challenge of collecting human preference data for aligning LLMs with human values. Source code for the tool is available online.

Abstract: Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, collecting such data is often expensive and inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge. To address this, we introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and diagnosing preference data. Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from existing preference datasets. These scores are then used to construct an Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance. Our experiments show that using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean, low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using the entire dataset. This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations. Moreover, the Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets. Our analysis shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated samples. Source code is available online.

The paper introduces MedE$^2$, a two-stage post-training pipeline designed to improve the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. In the first stage, models are fine-tuned using text-only data samples to elicit reasoning behaviors. The second stage enhances the model's reasoning capabilities using curated multimodal medical cases.

Abstract: Effective clinical decision-making depends on iterative, multimodal reasoning across diverse sources of evidence. The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.

TMDialog contains longer conversations, supporting research in multi-turn multi-modal dialogue. ContextQFormer is evaluated against three baselines on TMDialog, showing an improvement of 2%-4% in availability rate.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot abilities and powerful image-understanding capabilities. However, the existing open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information. Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training, instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue. In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of 2%-4% in available rate over baselines.

Abstract: Recently, long chain of thought (LCoT), Large Language Models (LLMs), have taken the machine learning world by storm with their breathtaking reasoning capabilities. However, are the abstract reasoning abilities of these models general enough for problems of practical importance? Unlike past work, which has focused mainly on math, coding, and data wrangling, we focus on a historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning problem, formulated as Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the best model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieving a mere 54% pass rate, demonstrating that LCoT LLMs still struggle with a class or reasoning that is ubiquitous in historical linguistics as well as many other domains.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across multiple crosslingual NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT). However, persistent challenges remain in addressing context-sensitive units (CSUs), such as polysemous words. These CSUs not only affect the local translation accuracy of LLMs, but also affect LLMs' understanding capability for sentences and tasks, and even lead to translation failure. To address this problem, we propose a simple but effective method to enhance LLMs' MT capabilities by acquiring CSUs and applying semantic focus. Specifically, we dynamically analyze and identify translation challenges, then incorporate them into LLMs in a structured manner to mitigate mistranslations or misunderstandings of CSUs caused by information flattening. Efficiently activate LLMs to identify and apply relevant knowledge from its vast data pool in this way, ensuring more accurate translations for translating difficult terms. On a benchmark dataset of MT, our proposed method achieved competitive performance compared to multiple existing open-sourced MT baseline models. It demonstrates effectiveness and robustness across multiple language pairs, including both similar language pairs and distant language pairs. Notably, the proposed method requires no additional model training and enhances LLMs' performance across multiple NLP tasks with minimal resource consumption.

Abstract: Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) is generally based on common domain data to obtain monolingual word embedding, and by aligning the monolingual word embeddings to obtain the cross-lingual embeddings which are used to get the word translation pairs. In this paper, we propose a new task of BLI, which is to use the monolingual corpus of the general domain and target domain to extract domain-specific bilingual dictionaries. Motivated by the ability of Pre-trained models, we propose a method to get better word embeddings that build on the recent work on BLI. This way, we introduce the Code Switch(Qin et al., 2020) firstly in the cross-domain BLI task, which can match differit is yet to be seen whether these methods are suitable for bilingual lexicon extraction in professional fields. As we can see in table 1, the classic and efficient BLI approach, Muse and Vecmap, perform much worse on the Medical dataset than on the Wiki dataset. On one hand, the specialized domain data set is relatively smaller compared to the generic domain data set generally, and specialized words have a lower frequency, which will directly affect the translation quality of bilingual dictionaries. On the other hand, static word embeddings are widely used for BLI, however, in some specific fields, the meaning of words is greatly influenced by context, in this case, using only static word embeddings may lead to greater bias. ent strategies in different contexts, making the model more suitable for this task. Experimental results show that our method can improve performances over robust BLI baselines on three specific domains by averagely improving 0.78 points.

<title>Tell, Don't Show: Leveraging Language Models' Abstractive Retellings to Model Literary Themes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional bag-of-words approaches for topic modeling, like latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), struggle with literary text. Literature challenges lexical methods because narrative language focuses on immersive sensory details instead of abstractive description or exposition: writers are advised to "show, don't tell." We propose Retell, a simple, accessible topic modeling approach for literature. Here, we prompt resource-efficient, generative language models (LMs) to tell what passages show, thereby translating narratives' surface forms into higher-level concepts and themes. By running LDA on LMs' retellings of passages, we can obtain more precise and informative topics than by running LDA alone or by directly asking LMs to list topics. To investigate the potential of our method for cultural analytics, we compare our method's outputs to expert-guided annotations in a case study on racial/cultural identity in high school English language arts books.

Abstract: We present ZIPA, a family of efficient speech models that advances the state-of-the-art performance of crosslinguistic phone recognition. We first curated IPAPack++, a large-scale multilingual speech corpus with 17,132 hours of normalized phone transcriptions and a novel evaluation set capturing unseen languages and sociophonetic variation. With the large-scale training data, ZIPA, including transducer (ZIPA-T) and CTC-based (ZIPA-CR) variants, leverage the efficient Zipformer backbones and outperform existing phone recognition systems with much fewer parameters. Further scaling via noisy student training on 11,000 hours of pseudo-labeled multilingual data yields further improvement. While ZIPA achieves strong performance on benchmarks, error analysis reveals persistent limitations in modeling sociophonetic diversity, underscoring challenges for future research.

Abstract: Transforming dense, detailed, unstructured text into an interpretable and summarised table, also colloquially known as Text-to-Table generation, is an essential task for information retrieval. Current methods, however, miss out on how and what complex information to extract; they also lack the ability to infer data from the text. In this paper, we introduce a versatile approach, Map&amp;Make, which "dissects" text into propositional atomic statements. This facilitates granular decomposition to extract the latent schema. The schema is then used to populate the tables that capture the qualitative nuances and the quantitative facts in the original text. Our approach is tested against two challenging datasets, Rotowire, renowned for its complex and multi-table schema, and Livesum, which demands numerical aggregation. By carefully identifying and correcting hallucination errors in Rotowire, we aim to achieve a cleaner and more reliable benchmark. We evaluate our method rigorously on a comprehensive suite of comparative and referenceless metrics. Our findings demonstrate significant improvement results across both datasets with better interpretability in Text-to-Table generation. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and analyses, we investigate the factors contributing to superior performance and validate the practicality of our framework in structured summarization tasks.

Abstract: Traditional code instruction data synthesis methods suffer from limited diversity and poor logic. We introduce Infinite-Instruct, an automated framework for synthesizing high-quality question-answer pairs, designed to enhance the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The framework focuses on improving the internal logic of synthesized problems and the quality of synthesized code. First, "Reverse Construction" transforms code snippets into diverse programming problems. Then, through "Backfeeding Construction," keywords in programming problems are structured into a knowledge graph to reconstruct them into programming problems with stronger internal logic. Finally, a cross-lingual static code analysis pipeline filters invalid samples to ensure data quality. Experiments show that on mainstream code generation benchmarks, our fine-tuned models achieve an average performance improvement of 21.70% on 7B-parameter models and 36.95% on 32B-parameter models. Using less than one-tenth of the instruction fine-tuning data, we achieved performance comparable to the Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct. Infinite-Instruct provides a scalable solution for LLM training in programming. We open-source the datasets used in the experiments, including both unfiltered versions and filtered versions via static analysis. The data are available at https://github.com/xingwenjing417/Infinite-Instruct-dataset

<title>Unsupervised Word-level Quality Estimation for Machine Translation Through the Lens of Annotators (Dis)agreement</title>

Abstract: Word-level quality estimation (WQE) aims to automatically identify fine-grained error spans in machine-translated outputs and has found many uses, including assisting translators during post-editing. Modern WQE techniques are often expensive, involving prompting of large language models or ad-hoc training on large amounts of human-labeled data. In this work, we investigate efficient alternatives exploiting recent advances in language model interpretability and uncertainty quantification to identify translation errors from the inner workings of translation models. In our evaluation spanning 14 metrics across 12 translation directions, we quantify the impact of human label variation on metric performance by using multiple sets of human labels. Our results highlight the untapped potential of unsupervised metrics, the shortcomings of supervised methods when faced with label uncertainty, and the brittleness of single-annotator evaluation practices.

<title>Cross-Task Experiential Learning on LLM-based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown remarkable progress in solving complex tasks through collaborative reasoning and inter-agent critique. However, existing approaches typically treat each task in isolation, resulting in redundant computations and limited generalization across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase, we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions on current tasks.

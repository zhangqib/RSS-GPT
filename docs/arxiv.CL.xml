<div> Keywords: multilingual NER, large language models, dataset creation, zero-shot transfer, annotation quality<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. This paper introduces FiNERweb, a scalable dataset-creation pipeline for multilingual named entity recognition (NER) covering 91 languages and 25 scripts using a teacher-student framework.<br>2. The method builds on FineWeb-Edu by training regression models to identify NER-relevant passages, which are then annotated by multilingual large language models (LLMs), producing around 225,000 passages with 235,000 distinct entity labels.<br>3. The regression models achieve over 84 F1 score in identifying relevant passages, demonstrating effective passage selection.<br>4. Models trained on the FiNERweb dataset show comparable or improved zero-shot transfer performance on English, Thai, and Swahili, despite using 19 times less training data than strong baseline models.<br>5. Annotation quality is validated using an LLM as a judge, yielding high faithfulness (3.99/5) and completeness (4.05/5) scores, indicating reliable and informative labels.<br>6. The dataset is released with both English labels and translated label sets in respective target languages, addressing performance drops observed (0.02 to 0.09 F1) when evaluating on non-English labels.<br>7. All related artifacts are publicly released to encourage further research in multilingual NER with effective teacher-student training paradigms. <div>

Abstract: Recent multilingual named entity recognition (NER) work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can provide effective synthetic supervision, yet such datasets have mostly appeared as by-products of broader experiments rather than as systematic, reusable resources. We introduce FiNERweb, a dataset-creation pipeline that scales the teacher-student paradigm to 91 languages and 25 scripts. Building on FineWeb-Edu, our approach trains regression models to identify NER-relevant passages and annotates them with multilingual LLMs, resulting in about 225k passages with 235k distinct entity labels. Our experiments show that the regression model achieves more than 84 F1, and that models trained on FiNERweb obtain comparable or improved performance in zero shot transfer settings on English, Thai, and Swahili, despite being trained on 19x less data than strong baselines. In addition, we assess annotation quality using LLM-as-a-judge and observe consistently high scores for both faithfulness (3.99 out of 5) and completeness (4.05 out of 5), indicating reliable and informative annotations. Further, we release the dataset with both English labels and translated label sets in the respective target languages because we observe that the performance of current state-of-the-art models drops by 0.02 to 0.09 F1 when evaluated using target language labels instead of English ones. We release FiNERweb together with all accompanying artifacts to the research community in order to facilitate more effective student-teacher training for multilingual named entity recognition.

<div> Keywords: structure-aware decoding, nested entity extraction, overlapping entities, hierarchical relationships, language models<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the challenge of extracting nested and overlapping entities while maintaining both semantic integrity and structural consistency. It proposes a structure-aware decoding method leveraging large pretrained language models as the backbone for context-aware semantic representation. A novel candidate span generation mechanism combined with structured attention modeling enables unified handling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies within the text. Multi-granular entity span features are captured by combining candidate representations, and hierarchical structural constraints are integrated during decoding to ensure consistent alignment between semantic information and structural hierarchy. The model is trained with a joint optimization of classification loss and structural consistency loss, enhancing its stability especially in complex scenarios involving multiple co-occurring entities and long-range dependencies. Experimental results on the ACE 2005 dataset show significant improvements across Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score metrics. Notably, performance gains are prominent in nested and overlapping entity recognition, demonstrating stronger boundary localization and effective structural modeling. This work confirms the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, offers a fresh perspective for integrating hierarchical understanding into language models, and lays methodological groundwork for achieving high-precision information extraction. <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a structure-aware decoding method based on large language models to address the difficulty of traditional approaches in maintaining both semantic integrity and structural consistency in nested and overlapping entity extraction tasks. The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.

<title>What Affects the Effective Depth of Large Language Models?</title>

<div> Keywords: effective depth, large language models, model scaling, layer utilization, reasoning performance<br><br>Summary: This paper investigates the concept of "effective depth" in large language models (LLMs), which measures how many layers are meaningfully used during inference, revealing that simply increasing model depth does not guarantee proportional performance improvements. The study focuses on the Qwen-2.5 family of models, ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, finding that while the absolute number of effective layers grows with model size, the ratio of effective depth to total layers remains roughly constant. Comparing baseline models with their long Chain-of-Thought (long-CoT) variants shows no change in effective depth, suggesting that enhanced reasoning capabilities derive primarily from processing longer contexts rather than deeper per-token computations. Additionally, evaluation across tasks of varying difficulty indicates that LLMs do not adaptively increase layer utilization for harder problems. These findings imply that current LLM architectures under-utilize their available depth regardless of scale, training approaches, or task complexity. The research highlights opportunities to improve LLM efficiency and performance through methods that increase layer utilization, such as model pruning and early exiting techniques. The authors have also made their code publicly available to enable further exploration of effective depth in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: The scaling of large language models (LLMs) emphasizes increasing depth, yet performance gains diminish with added layers. Prior work introduces the concept of "effective depth", arguing that deeper models fail to fully utilize their layers for meaningful computation. Building on this, we systematically study how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty. First, we analyze the model behavior of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems. Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting. Our code is released at https://github.com/AheadOFpotato/what_affects_effective_depth.

<div> Diffusion Language Models, AR-to-dLM Conversion, Block-wise Attention, Position-dependent Masking, Efficient-DLM  

<br><br>Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of improving the learning efficiency of diffusion language models (dLMs), which typically underperform compared to autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. It proposes converting pretrained AR models into more efficient dLMs through an AR-to-dLM conversion process that maintains task accuracy while enhancing generation speed. The authors identify critical limitations in prior AR-to-dLM methods, focusing on attention patterns and training objectives. A key insight is that preserving pretrained AR weight distributions plays a vital role in conversion effectiveness. To achieve this, they introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a novel block-wise attention pattern that is causal across blocks but bidirectional within each block, facilitating KV caching and better retention of pretrained weights. Additionally, they tackle the discrepancy between training and test-time token masking distributions by proposing a position-dependent token masking strategy that increases masking probabilities for later tokens during training, better matching test-time conditions. Extensive experiments investigate attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design factors, culminating in the Efficient-DLM family of models. Efficient-DLM models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with the Efficient-DLM 8B model achieving significantly higher accuracy (+5.4%/+2.7%) and throughput (4.5x/2.7x) compared to leading baselines Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.

<div> Keywords: UniSparse, sparse attention, large language models, composite tokens, efficiency<br><br>Summary:<br>Efficient long-context understanding and reasoning are essential for large language model (LLM) tasks like multi-turn dialogue and program analysis, but the quadratic scaling of self-attention with sequence length poses major computational challenges. Existing sparse attention techniques provide some relief but face trade-offs: training-based approaches are expensive and not easily adaptable as acceleration plugins, while inference-time methods may sacrifice efficiency or generality across modalities. To overcome these problems, the authors propose UniSparse, a unified sparse attention mechanism that leverages composite tokens—compact representations encapsulating multi-granularity contextual information. UniSparse dynamically constructs sparse attention through multi-level compression and block-level token selection, which allows for effective and hardware-friendly execution on GPUs. Evaluation across various modalities and tasks, from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications, demonstrates UniSparse surpasses state-of-the-art sparse attention methods like MInference, XAttention, and FlexPrefill. Notably, it achieves at least 99% of the accuracy of full-attention models while providing up to 2.61 times faster attention computation compared to FlashAttention. This approach enhances both accuracy and efficiency, presenting a practical solution for scalable long-sequence processing in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Efficient long-context understanding and reasoning are increasingly vital for large language model (LLM) applications such as multi-turn dialogue and program analysis. However, the core self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length, creating a fundamental computational bottleneck. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate this issue but face trade-offs: training-based methods are costly and cannot be directly applied as acceleration plugins for other models, while inference-time methods often compromise efficiency or cross-modal generality. To address these limitations, we present UniSparse, a unified mechanism that introduces the notion of composite tokens--compact representations that aggregate multi-granularity contextual information. Building on this abstraction, UniSparse dynamically constructs sparse attention through multi-granularity compression and block-level selection, enabling efficient and hardware-friendly execution on GPU. Across multiple modalities and tasks ranging from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications, UniSparse consistently surpasses state-of-the-art sparse attention methods (e.g., MInference, XAttention, FlexPrefill) in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving $\ge$ 99% of full-attention accuracy and up to 2.61$\times$ faster attention computation than FlashAttention.

<div> Keywords: multilingual backchannel prediction, Transformer model, cross-linguistic timing, Japanese English Chinese, spoken dialogue systems<br><br>Summary:  
This work introduces a multilingual backchannel prediction model that handles Japanese, English, and Chinese simultaneously. The model is based on the Transformer architecture operating at the frame level and trained with auxiliary tasks on around 300 hours of dyadic conversational data. Results demonstrate that the multilingual model performs as well as or better than monolingual models, indicating its ability to capture both universal and language-specific backchannel timing cues. However, zero-shot transfer between languages when training with only two languages remains limited, highlighting significant cross-lingual differences. Perturbation studies show Japanese speakers rely more on short-term linguistic cues, whereas English and Chinese speakers are more sensitive to silence duration and prosodic variation, and multilingual training reduces overdependence on pitch cues in Chinese. A context-length analysis reveals that Japanese backchanneling is robust to shorter context windows, while Chinese benefits considerably from longer conversational context. Finally, the paper integrates the trained model into real-time software capable of CPU-only inference, illustrating practical deployment. Overall, the research provides a unified model and empirical insight into cross-language backchannel timing, offering guidance for building more natural and culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems. <div>

Abstract: We present a multilingual, continuous backchannel prediction model for Japanese, English, and Chinese, and use it to investigate cross-linguistic timing behavior. The model is Transformer-based and operates at the frame level, jointly trained with auxiliary tasks on approximately 300 hours of dyadic conversations. Across all three languages, the multilingual model matches or surpasses monolingual baselines, indicating that it learns both language-universal cues and language-specific timing patterns. Zero-shot transfer with two-language training remains limited, underscoring substantive cross-lingual differences. Perturbation analyses reveal distinct cue usage: Japanese relies more on short-term linguistic information, whereas English and Chinese are more sensitive to silence duration and prosodic variation; multilingual training encourages shared yet adaptable representations and reduces overreliance on pitch in Chinese. A context-length study further shows that Japanese is relatively robust to shorter contexts, while Chinese benefits markedly from longer contexts. Finally, we integrate the trained model into a real-time processing software, demonstrating CPU-only inference. Together, these findings provide a unified model and empirical evidence for how backchannel timing differs across languages, informing the design of more natural, culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, iterative reasoning, memory-augmented architecture, Long-Term Memory, reasoning consistency<br><br>Summary: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with accuracy and coherence over extended multi-turn interactions, often experiencing issues such as reasoning bias, task drift, hallucination, overconfidence, and memory decay. To address these challenges, the paper introduces CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture designed to support sustained iterative reasoning with structured and persistent memory. CogMem features a three-layer memory system: Long-Term Memory (LTM) to consolidate cross-session reasoning strategies, Direct Access (DA) memory to maintain session-level notes and retrieve relevant long-term memories, and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism to dynamically reconstruct concise, task-relevant context at each turn. This approach counters the typical problem of unbounded context growth seen in current methods that append full conversation history, which leads to increased computational costs and reduced reasoning efficiency. Experimental results on TurnBench demonstrate that CogMem's layered memory design effectively mitigates common reasoning failures, controls context size, and improves consistency and coherence through extended reasoning chains. Overall, CogMem moves toward more reliable and human-like reasoning abilities in large language models, enabling improved performance in multi-turn dialogues and complex reasoning tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at single-turn reasoning but often lose accuracy and coherence over extended, multi-turn interactions. Recent evaluations such as TurnBench highlight recurring failure modes-reasoning bias, task drift, hallucination, overconfidence, and memory decay. Current approaches typically append full conversational histories, causing unbounded context growth, higher computational costs, and degraded reasoning efficiency. We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn. Experiments on TurnBench show that this layered design mitigates reasoning failures, controls context growth, and improves consistency across extended reasoning chains, moving toward more reliable, human-like reasoning in LLMs.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, scheduling, inference systems, Job Completion Time, hierarchical scheduling<br><br>Summary: This paper addresses the inefficiencies in existing inference systems when running Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent agents with multi-stage workflows involving both local computation and external network calls. Current systems optimize at a per-segment level, which fails to minimize the overall latency or Job Completion Time (JCT) of the full agentic workflow. To tackle this, the authors introduce Astraea, a service engine that shifts the optimization focus from local segments to the entire request lifecycle. Astraea utilizes a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that incorporates both past request states and future workload predictions. It dynamically categorizes requests by their I/O and compute demands, applying an enhanced Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) policy to strike a balance between efficiency and fairness. Additionally, Astraea features an adaptive key-value cache manager that effectively manages agent state during I/O waits, adjusting based on system memory pressure. Experimental results show that Astraea achieves up to a 25.5% reduction in average Job Completion Time compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover, the approach displays strong robustness and system stability under heavy loads and across different model scales, making it a promising solution for optimizing LLM-driven workflows. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.

<div> Keywords: Bengali dialect translation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Transcript-Based Pipeline, Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, low-resource NLP<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. Translating from a standard language to its regional dialects presents significant challenges due to scarce data and linguistic variations, with Bengali as a prime example.<br>2. This paper proposes and compares two novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines specifically designed for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation: a Transcript-Based Pipeline and a Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline.<br>3. The Transcript-Based Pipeline leverages large dialect sentence contexts extracted from audio transcripts, while the more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline utilizes structured pairs of local dialect sentences matched with their standard Bengali equivalents.<br>4. Both pipelines were evaluated across six Bengali dialects and multiple large language models (LLMs), using metrics such as BLEU, ChrF, Word Error Rate (WER), and BERTScore.<br>5. Results demonstrate that the Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline consistently outperforms the Transcript-Based Pipeline, notably reducing WER from 76% to 55% for the Chittagong dialect.<br>6. Importantly, this approach allows smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to surpass much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), highlighting that an effective retrieval strategy can be more critical than model size.<br>7.

Abstract: Translating from a standard language to its regional dialects is a significant NLP challenge due to scarce data and linguistic variation, a problem prominent in the Bengali language. This paper proposes and compares two novel RAG pipelines for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation. The first, a Transcript-Based Pipeline, uses large dialect sentence contexts from audio transcripts. The second, a more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, utilizes structured local\_dialect:standard\_bengali sentence pairs. We evaluated both pipelines across six Bengali dialects and multiple LLMs using BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore. Our findings show that the sentence-pair pipeline consistently outperforms the transcript-based one, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) from 76\% to 55\% for the Chittagong dialect. Critically, this RAG approach enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to outperform much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), demonstrating that a well-designed retrieval strategy can be more crucial than model size. This work contributes an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity.

<div> Fine-tuning, Large Language Models, Memory Efficiency, Ladder Side Tuning, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) typically faces memory constraints on standard GPUs, driving the need for more memory-efficient methods.<br>2. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approaches like QLoRA reduce trainable parameters but still suffer from high memory usage during the backward pass.<br>3. The paper revisits Ladder Side Tuning (LST), a less explored PEFT method that adds a lightweight side network, achieving similar compute scaling to QLoRA while halving peak memory usage.<br>4. Experiments across diverse tasks—including natural language understanding, math, and LLM evaluation benchmarks—show LST matches QLoRA's accuracy on average with substantially better memory efficiency.<br>5. LST enables fine-tuning 7-billion parameter models on a single 12GB GPU with 2,000-token contexts without gradient checkpointing, a scenario where QLoRA runs out of memory.<br>6. The authors establish scaling laws demonstrating that LST scales comparably to QLoRA.<br>7. They propose xLadder, a depth-extended variant of Ladder that uses cross-connections to increase effective depth and shorten chain-of-thought reasoning without adding memory overhead.<br>8. Overall, Ladder is advantageous in memory-constrained settings, while xLadder extends its reasoning capability efficiently. <div>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is often limited by the memory available on commodity GPUs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as QLoRA reduce the number of trainable parameters, yet still incur high memory usage induced by the backward pass in the full model. We revisit Ladder Side Tuning (LST), a rarely explored PEFT technique that adds a lightweight side network, and show that it matches QLoRA's compute scaling slope while cutting peak memory by 50\%. Across different downstream benchmarks spanning natural language understanding, mathematical and LLM-critic tasks, LST has competitive performance with QLoRA's accuracy on average while being much more memory-efficient. This efficiency enables fine-tuning of 7B-parameter models on a single 12 GB consumer GPU with 2k-token contexts, requiring no gradient checkpointing\textemdash conditions under which QLoRA exhausts memory. Beyond memory efficiency, we also establish scaling laws showing that LST scales similarly to QLoRA. We exploit Ladder's architectural flexibility by introducing xLadder, a depth-extended variant that increases effective depth via cross-connections and shortens chain-of-thought (CoT) at fixed parameter count. Ladder is strong when memory is the bottleneck; xLadder builds on this by enabling deeper reasoning without additional memory overhead.

<div> Keywords: Nawatl, Context-Free Grammar, Corpora Expansion, Large Language Models, Semantic Similarity<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. The article focuses on addressing the scarcity of digital resources for Nawatl, an Amerindian language and a National Language of Mexico, by proposing methods to expand its textual corpora.<br>2. Nawatl is described as a $\pi$-language, meaning it has very limited digital data available for training language models, which complicates the development of effective Large Language Models (LLMs).<br>3. To overcome this challenge, the authors introduce two new Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) specifically designed for generating syntactically valid artificial sentences in Nawatl.<br>4. These CFGs are applied in a generative mode to produce a significant number of artificial Nawatl sentences, thereby enriching the original corpus substantially.<br>5. Utilizing the expanded corpora, the study trains non-contextual embeddings and evaluates their performance on a sentence semantic similarity task, demonstrating that the augmented data improves results over using only the original corpus.<br>6. Furthermore, the findings suggest that economic embeddings trained on the expanded data often outperform some large language models, indicating the effectiveness of the CFG-based synthetic data generation approach for low-resource languages like Nawatl. <div>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to introduce two Context-Free Grammars (CFG) for Nawatl Corpora expansion. Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $\pi$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs.

Abstract: Managing extensive context remains a critical bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in applications like long-document question answering and autonomous agents where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, inflation perceptions, GPT-3.5-turbo, survey comparison, Shapley value decomposition<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper examines the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo, to form perceptions and expectations about inflation based on macroeconomic price signals. The authors benchmark the LLM’s responses against household survey data and official UK inflation statistics by replicating the information environment and demographic features of the Bank of England’s Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Utilizing the September 2021 GPT training cut-off as a natural experimental boundary, they highlight that GPT lacks information about the post-training UK inflation surge. Findings indicate that GPT aligns closely with aggregate inflation projections and official data in the short term. At a more detailed level, the model mirrors key patterns seen in households’ inflation perceptions across income, housing tenure, and social class. An innovative Shapley value decomposition tailored to synthetic survey outputs offers clear insights into how different prompt elements influence the model’s inflation expectations. Notably, GPT exhibits a sensitivity to food inflation similar to human respondents but does not consistently model consumer price inflation. The study suggests this approach could serve as a valuable tool to assess LLM behavior in social science applications, facilitate model comparisons, and aid survey design. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo (GPT), to form inflation perceptions and expectations based on macroeconomic price signals. We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Language Reasoning Models, Step-Tagging framework, ReasonType taxonomy, early stopping, token reduction<br><br>Summary:  
1. The paper addresses inefficiencies in Language Reasoning Models (LRMs), which tend to over-generate verification and reflection steps during reasoning.

Abstract: The field of Language Reasoning Models (LRMs) has been very active over the past few years with advances in training and inference techniques enabling LRMs to reason longer, and more accurately. However, a growing body of studies show that LRMs are still inefficient, over-generating verification and reflection steps. To address this challenge, we introduce the Step-Tagging framework, a lightweight sentence-classifier enabling real-time annotation of the type of reasoning steps that an LRM is generating. To monitor reasoning behaviors, we introduced ReasonType: a novel taxonomy of reasoning steps. Building on this framework, we demonstrated that online monitoring of the count of specific steps can produce effective interpretable early stopping criteria of LRM inferences. We evaluate the Step-tagging framework on three open-source reasoning models across standard benchmark datasets: MATH500, GSM8K, AIME and non-mathematical tasks (GPQA and MMLU-Pro). We achieve 20 to 50\% token reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy to standard generation, with largest gains observed on more computation-heavy tasks. This work offers a novel way to increase control over the generation of LRMs, and a new tool to study behaviors of LRMs.

<div> Keywords: large language models, document packing, multi-hop reasoning, training strategies, computational efficiency<br><br>Summary:  
This study examines the effect of document packing—a method of combining multiple documents during training—on the performance of large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on their latent multi-hop reasoning abilities. The researchers found that training LLMs with packed documents can enhance reasoning performance compared to training on single documents. However, this improvement comes with increased computational costs. To better understand why packing benefits model capabilities, the authors performed an ablation study, isolating key factors contributing to the observed gains. Their results shed light on the training dynamics underlying LLM development, revealing that packing introduces richer contextual opportunities that may support complex reasoning. The study offers valuable practical insights for optimizing training protocols, balancing performance improvement against computational expense. Ultimately, the research deepens our understanding of how document manipulation during training influences LLM abilities, guiding more effective and efficient model development strategies. <div>

Abstract: The standard practice for training large language models involves packing multiple documents together to optimize computational efficiency. However, the impact of this process on the models' capabilities remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how different document-packing strategies influence the latent multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings indicate that packing can improve model performance compared to training on individual documents, at the expense of more compute. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we conduct an ablation study, identifying key factors that explain the advantages of packing. Ultimately, our research deepens the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides practical insights for optimizing model development.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Quantization, Activation Quantization, SASQ, Model Compression<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the deployment challenges of large language models (LLMs) caused by their increasing size surpassing GPU memory capacity. Model quantization is a common approach to reduce memory and computational demands by lowering weight and activation precision; however, existing methods face critical trade-offs. Dynamic quantization introduces high computational overhead and is difficult to deploy on edge devices, while static quantization tends to degrade accuracy. Traditional quantization-aware training (QAT) methods require costly weight retraining. The authors propose SASQ, a lightweight QAT framework that focuses solely on optimizing activation quantization factors without altering pre-trained weights. This enables static inference that maintains high accuracy and deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates outliers in activation distributions to ease quantization difficulty while preserving essential distributional properties. Empirical results demonstrate that SASQ outperforms state-of-the-art quantization methods and even surpasses FP16 precision models. Specifically, on the LLaMA2-7B model evaluated on WikiText2, SASQ achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than the QuaRot method and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 baseline, highlighting its effectiveness in practical large model compression and deployment. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but face deployment challenges due to their growing size outpacing GPU memory advancements. Model quantization mitigates this issue by lowering weight and activation precision, but existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs: dynamic quantization incurs high computational overhead and poses deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, linguistics, generative language models, audio-based models, human language<br><br>Summary: The article critiques the focus of Futrell and Mahowald’s framework, which aims to bridge technology-oriented deep learning systems and explanation-oriented linguistic theories, for being narrowly centered on generative text-based large language models (LLMs). This text-based emphasis restricts the scope of interaction with linguistics, as many vital questions in human language extend beyond written text. The authors argue that this limitation overlooks important aspects of language that are not captured solely by text. They propose that audio-based deep learning models represent a crucial and complementary avenue for advancing the study of human language. Incorporating audio data not only enriches linguistic analysis but also offers broader insights into speech, prosody, and other paralinguistic features. Consequently, integrating audio-based models into the research paradigm can foster deeper and more comprehensive interactions between computational approaches and linguistic theory, addressing phenomena that text-centric models inherently cannot. This approach advocates for expanding the methodological toolkit in language technologies to better reflect the multimodal nature of human communication. <div>

<div> Parameters reuse, Large Language Models, Feed-Forward Network, Adaptive pathways, Computation efficiency<br><br>Summary: The paper addresses the challenge of escalating memory costs in Large Language Models (LLMs) as they scale, noting that current parameter-efficient methods like pruning and quantization limit model capacity by only compressing pretrained models. To overcome this, the authors propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network design that enables flexible parameter reuse in both width and depth dimensions without increasing the parameter count. VersatileFFN is inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition and consists of two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that creates a mixture of sub-experts from a shared FFN, simulating sparse expert routing without added parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to simulate deeper processing for complex inputs. A difficulty-aware gating mechanism dynamically balances these two pathways by directing simpler tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating iterative refinement to more difficult tokens. This design increases model capacity through additional computation rather than memory, maintaining a fixed parameter budget. Experiments across various benchmarks and model sizes validate the effectiveness of VersatileFFN, demonstrating that it enhances model representational power efficiently. The authors will release the code on GitHub to facilitate further research and application. <div>
arXiv:2512.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance, but it also leads to prohibitive memory costs. Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering "easy" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to "hard" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/VersatileFFN.

<div> autoregressive modeling, masked-diffusion, dual-objective training, language models, overfitting<br><br>Summary: This paper introduces a novel training approach for language models by combining autoregressive and masked-diffusion objectives without modifying the model architecture. Autoregressive models are known for their training efficiency but can suffer from overfitting, whereas masked-diffusion models are more resilient to overfitting but less efficient. By employing a dual-objective training strategy, the authors manage to leverage the strengths of both methods, producing models that outperform those trained with a single objective. To determine the best balance between the two objectives, the study involves training and evaluating 50 language models across different levels of data repetition. The findings reveal that incorporating both objectives consistently yields superior results in all tested scenarios. Furthermore, the optimal ratio between autoregressive and masked-diffusion objectives remains largely consistent whether the target is to improve performance in autoregressive tasks or masked-diffusion downstream applications. This work highlights the practicality and effectiveness of dual-objective training, enabling the construction of more flexible and robust language models capable of reducing overfitting while maintaining efficient training. <div>
arXiv:2512.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper combines autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives without any architectural modifications, resulting in flexible language models that outperform single-objective models. Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.

<div> Keywords: Vietnamese Legal Benchmark, large language models, legal AI, VLegal-Bench, legal understanding  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper introduces the Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench), the first comprehensive evaluation benchmark specifically developed to assess the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Vietnamese legal tasks. Given the complexity, hierarchical nature, and frequent updates of Vietnamese legislation, evaluating AI systems in this domain presents unique challenges. VLegal-Bench addresses these challenges by incorporating a range of tasks inspired by Bloom’s cognitive taxonomy, enabling assessment across multiple levels of legal understanding. The benchmark consists of 10,450 samples created through a rigorous annotation process involving legal experts who label and cross-validate data to ensure each sample is grounded in authoritative Vietnamese legal documents. Tasks cover practical legal assistant scenarios such as general legal question answering, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step legal reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored specifically to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench offers a solid foundation for reliably measuring LLM capabilities in the Vietnamese legal context. This work aims to foster the development of AI-assisted legal systems that are more interpretable, reliable, and ethically aligned to the specific needs of Vietnamese legal practitioners and users. <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain. Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.

This article reviews the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in automatic essay scoring (AES) compared to human raters.<br><br>2. Using PRISMA 2020 guidelines, the authors synthesized 65 studies published or unpublished from January 2022 to August 2025, focusing on the agreement between LLMs and human scores.<br><br>3.

Abstract: Despite the growing promise of large language models (LLMs) in automatic essay scoring (AES), empirical findings regarding their reliability compared to human raters remain mixed. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we synthesized 65 published and unpublished studies from January 2022 to August 2025 that examined agreement between LLMs and human raters in AES. Across studies, reported LLM-human agreement was generally moderate to good, with agreement indices (e.g., Quadratic Weighted Kappa, Pearson correlation, and Spearman's rho) mostly ranging between 0.30 and 0.80. Substantial variability in agreement levels was observed across studies, reflecting differences in study-specific factors as well as the lack of standardized reporting practices. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

<div> Keywords: PolyPersona, persona-conditioned, survey responses, LoRA adapters, multi-domain evaluation<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper presents PolyPersona, a generative framework designed to synthesize persona-conditioned survey responses across multiple domains. The framework employs instruction tuning of compact chat models using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters combined with 4-bit quantization, optimized under a resource-adaptive training scheme. A dialogue-based data pipeline is introduced to explicitly preserve persona cues, ensuring the generated responses maintain consistent behavioral alignment with the intended persona. Leveraging this pipeline, the authors construct a dataset containing 3,568 synthetic survey responses covering ten domains and 433 unique personas, facilitating controlled instruction tuning and systematic evaluation across domains. The evaluation adopts a comprehensive multi-metric suite combining traditional text generation metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, along with survey-specific metrics aimed at assessing structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment. Experimental findings reveal that small models—such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2—achieve performance comparable to much larger 7B-8B parameter baselines, with observed top BLEU and ROUGE-1 scores of 0.090 and 0.429, respectively. These results highlight that persona-conditioned fine-tuning empowers compact language models to produce reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. Overall, PolyPersona offers an efficient, reproducible approach for scalable survey data generation and paves the way for bias analysis via transparent, open protocols. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces PolyPersona, a generative framework for synthesizing persona-conditioned survey responses across multiple domains. The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reproducible approach for survey data generation, supporting scalable evaluation while facilitating bias analysis through transparent and open protocols.

<div> Keywords: Nepali NLP, GPT-2, Byte-Pair Encoding, FlashAttention, low-resource language<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the challenges of natural language processing for Nepali, a low-resource language with complex grammar and morphology, spoken by over 32 million people. Existing models primarily use basic encoder architectures, which are inadequate for Nepali-specific text generation tasks. To improve performance, the authors develop a GPT-2-based language model incorporating training strategies inspired by GPT-3, such as optimized learning rate schedules, batch scaling, and architectural improvements. Additionally, they create a custom 16k Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer trained exclusively on Nepali text to provide more consistent token segmentation and better input representation. The model is pretrained on a large combined dataset including a 10.75GB cleaned NepBERTa corpus and supplementary Nepali news articles gathered via web scraping. FlashAttention is integrated into the training process to reduce memory consumption and stabilize training dynamics. After completing two epochs, the model achieves a training loss of 3.168177, validation loss of 3.081982, and a final perplexity score of 21.80, illustrating its effectiveness in generating coherent and relevant Nepali news-style text. This work demonstrates a significant advancement in language modeling tailored for the Nepali language and serves as a foundation for further NLP applications in low-resource linguistic settings. <div>

Abstract: Nepali, a low-resource language spoken by over 32 million people, continues to face challenges in natural language processing (NLP) due to its complex grammar, agglutinative morphology, and limited availability of high-quality corpora. Most efforts to date have centered on basic encoder architectures; they remain insufficient for Nepali-specific text generation. This study presents a GPT-2-based Nepali language model trained using several training strategies inspired by GPT-3, including optimized learning rate schedules, batch scaling, and architectural refinements. A custom 16k Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer was trained exclusively on Nepali text to ensure more consistent segmentation and improved input representation. The model was pretrained on a combined dataset comprising a 10.75GB cleaned NepBERTa corpus and additional web-scraped Nepali news articles. FlashAttention was integrated to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. After two epochs, the model achieved a training loss of 3.168177, a validation loss of 3.081982, and a final perplexity of 21.80, demonstrating its capability to generate coherent Nepali news-style text.

<div> Japanese multimodal benchmark, image generation, Vibe Benchmark Construction, large multimodal models, visual-textual understanding<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper presents JMMMU-Pro, an advanced image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark designed to enhance integrated visual-textual comprehension. Building on the initial MMMU benchmark, JMMMU-Pro uniquely combines question images and question text into a single image, promoting deeper visual perception for evaluation tasks. To create this benchmark efficiently and at scale, the authors introduce Vibe Benchmark Construction, a novel methodology that utilizes an image generative model, such as Nano Banana Pro, to produce candidate visual questions. Human reviewers then verify the quality of these outputs and adjust prompts when needed, ensuring high fidelity and relevance. Nano Banana Pro's skills in generating highly realistic images with embedded clean Japanese text allow the benchmark to cover diverse backgrounds and layout styles, maintaining cost-effectiveness. Experimental evaluations indicate that existing open-source Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) face significant challenges when tested on JMMMU-Pro, highlighting its value as a demanding benchmark. Consequently, JMMMU-Pro serves as a crucial tool for rigorously assessing Japanese multimodal language model capabilities and guides the open-source community’s future research. Additionally, the Vibe Benchmark Construction method offers a practical and efficient framework for developing image-based visual question answering benchmarks moving forward. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces JMMMU-Pro, an image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark, and Vibe Benchmark Construction, a scalable construction method. Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: small models, distillation, TiME, low-resource languages, efficiency

<br><br>Summary: This paper addresses the need for specialized, small NLP models that focus on a limited set of capabilities rather than the broad functionality of large, general-purpose language models. Large models, while versatile, suffer from slow processing speeds, high energy consumption, and deployment challenges on battery-powered devices, making them unsuitable for real-time or large-scale data applications. The authors introduce TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders), a suite of small models optimized for efficiency-critical tasks. These models leverage modern training techniques such as knowledge distillation to achieve a better balance between benchmark performance and operational metrics like throughput, latency, and energy use. Importantly, TiME models provide support for low-resource languages, which are often underrepresented. The study also demonstrates the feasibility of distilling monolingual models from multilingual teacher models, as well as transferring knowledge across different positional embedding strategies (from relative to absolute embeddings). Overall, TiME offers a sustainable and practical alternative to large language models by targeting specific NLP tasks with faster, more energy-efficient, and linguistically inclusive small models. <div>

Abstract: Today, a lot of research on language models is focused on large, general-purpose models. However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.

<div> Multi-token generation, diffusion Large Language Models, Jacobi Forcing, parallel decoding, inference speedup<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. Multi-token generation has become a critical approach for accelerating inference in transformer-based large language models by enabling parallel decoding.<br>2. Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have been explored for parallel decoding, but existing methods struggle to achieve autoregressive (AR)-level generation quality and provide limited speedup due to a mismatch between pretraining and post-training data distributions.<br>3. This mismatch arises because dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal attention learned during pretraining, making it difficult to reuse key-value caches efficiently.<br>4. The authors propose Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation method where the model is trained on its own generated parallel decoding trajectories, gradually transforming AR models into efficient parallel decoders while maintaining their pretrained causal inference capabilities.<br>5. Models trained under the Jacobi Forcing paradigm demonstrate a 3.8× speedup in wall-clock time on benchmarks involving coding and math tasks with minimal performance loss.<br>6. Additionally, a multi-block decoding strategy with rejection recycling is introduced based on the Jacobi Forcing models' trajectory properties, achieving up to 4.5× higher token acceptance per iteration and nearly 4.0× speedup in inference latency by trading additional computation.<br>7. The approach offers a significant advancement in balancing model performance and inference speed, with source code available for public use. <div>

Abstract: Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JacobiForcing.

<div> Keywords: Spoken DialogSum, emotion-rich summaries, audio language models, paralinguistic cues, Audio-LLM  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper presents Spoken DialogSum, a novel dataset designed to advance research in emotion-aware and spoken dialogue summarization by aligning raw conversational audio with both factual and emotion-rich summaries. The dataset addresses the challenge of lacking resources that connect speech with summaries and paralinguistic information. It is constructed in two phases: initially, a large language model (LLM) rewrites existing DialogSum scripts by incorporating Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then annotates each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate labels. Subsequently, an expressive text-to-speech (TTS) engine synthesizes speech from these tagged scripts, enabling alignment with paralinguistic labels at the utterance level such as speaker age, gender, and emotion. Spoken DialogSum contains 13,460 dialogues reflecting emotional diversity, each accompanied by both factual and emotion-focused summaries. Baseline experiments demonstrate that an end-to-end Audio-LLM model significantly improves emotional-summary quality, increasing ROUGE-L scores by 28% compared to cascaded ASR followed by LLM summarization. This highlights the effectiveness of modeling speech directly for emotion-sensitive summarization tasks. The dataset and audio samples are publicly accessible at the provided URL, fostering further research in multimodal dialogue understanding. <div>

Abstract: Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.

<div> Keywords: Video foundation models, reasoning evaluation, MMGR benchmark, physical commonsense, spatial planning  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper introduces MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a novel evaluation framework designed to assess the reasoning capabilities of video and image generative models beyond mere perceptual quality. Existing metrics like Frechet Video Distance focus primarily on visual realism but fail to detect failures in reasoning including causality, physics, and global consistency. MMGR evaluates five core reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal reasoning. The benchmark tests generative reasoning performance across three diverse domains: Abstract Reasoning (such as ARC-AGI and Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (involving real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (covering sports and compositional interactions). MMGR uses fine-grained, holistic correctness metrics that require models to generate both video and image content accurately according to reasoning criteria. When applied to leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana variants, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), results reveal significant gaps in reasoning ability. While models moderately succeed in Physical Commonsense tasks, they perform very poorly in Abstract Reasoning tasks, such as less than 10% accuracy on ARC-AGI, and struggle with long-term spatial planning. The analysis points to overreliance on perceptual data and deficits in maintaining global state consistency, largely because training objectives reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR provides a unified tool for diagnosing and advancing reasoning-aware generative world models. <div>

Abstract: Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.

<div> Keywords: information theory, random typing, typical text, Shakespeare, probability<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. The article revisits the classical "infinite monkey theorem," which states that a monkey typing randomly would eventually produce the complete works of William Shakespeare, but notes that the required time is astronomically large and practically irrelevant.<br>2. It introduces the concept of an "educated monkey," which still types randomly but restricts output to statistically typical text, dramatically reducing the expected time to generate specific passages.<br>3. Using principles from information theory, the authors estimate the time needed for such an educated monkey to produce given Shakespearean phrases, showing a stark contrast with a purely random typist.<br>4. For instance, Shakespeare's phrase "Better three hours too soon than a minute too late" would take the educated monkey about 73 thousand years to produce, compared to about 2.7 × 10^63 years for a completely random monkey.<br>5. Despite this significant improvement, the time required for the educated monkey to produce all of "Hamlet" remains astronomically large at roughly 10^42,277 years, emphasizing the practical improbability of the task even under constraints. <div>

Abstract: It has often been said, correctly, that a monkey forever randomly typing on a keyboard would eventually produce the complete works of William Shakespeare. Almost just as often it has been pointed out that this "eventually" is well beyond any conceivably relevant time frame. We point out that an educated monkey that still types at random but is constrained to only write "statistically typical" text, would produce any given passage in a much shorter time. Information theory gives a very simple way to estimate that time. For example, Shakespeare's phrase, Better three hours too soon than a minute too late, from The Merry Wives of Windsor, would take the educated monkey only 73 thousand years to produce, compared to the beyond-astronomical $2.7 \times 10^{63}$ years for the randomly typing one. Despite the obvious improvement, it would still take the educated monkey an unimaginably long $10^{42,277}$ years to produce all of Hamlet.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, human-AI coevolution, creative writing, stylistic differentiation, authorship adaptation  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper explores the evolving relationship between humans and AI in the domain of creative writing, focusing on how both human creativity and machine capabilities influence each other. The study challenges the common belief that AI use in writing leads to stylistic homogenization. Instead, by analyzing a large dataset of writing before and after the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the authors identify a "Dual-Track Evolution." This phenomenon involves thematic convergence, where writers increasingly engage with AI-related topics, alongside maintained or enhanced stylistic diversity. Three main adaptation patterns emerge: some authors’ writing styles grow closer to AI-generated text, others distance themselves stylistically from AI, and a group maintains stable stylistic traits while still adopting AI-related themes. The researchers present a Creative Archetype Map to categorize these adaptation patterns, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of human-AI collaboration in writing. The findings contribute to ongoing debates about creative agency, the challenges of detecting AI-influenced text, and strategies for preserving diversity in creative expression amid accelerating AI integration. <div>

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises a critical question about what it means to be human when we share an increasingly symbiotic relationship with persuasive and creative machines. This paper examines patterns of human-AI coevolution in creative writing, investigating how human craft and agency are adapting alongside machine capabilities. We challenge the prevailing notion of stylistic homogenization by examining diverse patterns in longitudinal writing data. Using a large-scale corpus spanning the pre- and post-LLM era, we observe patterns suggestive of a "Dual-Track Evolution": thematic convergence around AI-related topics, coupled with structured stylistic differentiation. Our analysis reveals three emergent adaptation patterns: authors showing increased similarity to AI style, those exhibiting decreased similarity, and those maintaining stylistic stability while engaging with AI-related themes. This Creative Archetype Map illuminates how authorship is coevolving with AI, contributing to discussions about human-AI collaboration, detection challenges, and the preservation of creative diversity.

Abstract: Manual chart review remains an extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive component of clinical research, requiring experts to extract often complex information from unstructured electronic health record (EHR) narratives. We present a secure, modular framework for automated structured feature extraction from clinical notes leveraging locally deployed large language models (LLMs) on institutionally approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)-compliant compute infrastructure. This system integrates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and structured response methods of LLMs into a widely deployable and scalable container to provide feature extraction for diverse clinical domains. In evaluation, the framework achieved high accuracy across multiple medical characteristics present in large bodies of patient notes when compared against an expert-annotated dataset and identified several annotation errors missed in manual review. This framework demonstrates the potential of LLM systems to reduce the burden of manual chart review through automated extraction and increase consistency in data capture, accelerating clinical research.

<div> Mathematical reasoning, catastrophic forgetting, finetuning, mixed training, Flan-T5-Base<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This study investigates catastrophic forgetting in large language models when finetuned for specialized tasks, particularly mathematical reasoning. Using Flan-T5-Base (250M parameters) fine-tuned on the DeepMind Mathematics dataset, the authors observe a substantial drop in performance on natural language inference (NLI) tasks, specifically MultiNLI, where accuracy falls from 81.0% to 16.5% after math-only training. Math-only finetuning increases mathematical accuracy from 3.1% to 12.0% but severely degrades general capabilities, revealing catastrophic forgetting occurring rapidly within 1,000 training steps. The research proposes mixed training strategies that interleave math and NLI examples to counteract forgetting. Experiments with varying mixing ratios (from 1:1 to 15:1) show that a balanced 1:1 ratio maintains math performance at 12.0% while preserving NLI accuracy at 86.2%, surpassing the original baseline. Even minimal exposure to NLI data (6.2%) acts as effective regularization. These findings demonstrate that specialization in mathematical reasoning does not necessitate losing general language capabilities. The results suggest mixed training as a scalable approach for larger models that could prevent forgetting and improve overall robustness during fine-tuning on specialized tasks. <div>

Abstract: When finetuning large language models for specialized tasks such as mathematical reasoning, models exhibit catastrophic forgetting, losing previously learned capabilities. We investigate this by finetuning Flan-T5-Base (250M parameters) on the DeepMind Mathematics dataset and measuring forgetting on MultiNLI. Math-only training improves mathematical accuracy from 3.1\% to 12.0\% but causes NLI accuracy to collapse from 81.0\% to 16.5\%--a 64.5 percentage point drop occurring within the first 1,000 training steps. We propose mixed training strategies that interleave mathematical and NLI examples during training. Our results demonstrate that mixed training completely eliminates catastrophic forgetting while maintaining equivalent mathematical performance: the balanced 1:1 ratio achieves 12.0\% math accuracy (matching math-only) while preserving 86.2\% NLI accuracy. We systematically explore mixing ratios from 1:1 to 15:1, finding that even minimal NLI exposure (6.2\%) provides effective regularization. These findings demonstrate that specialization need not require forgetting general capabilities, with implications for scaling to larger models where mixed training may confer additional benefits beyond forgetting prevention.

<div> Keywords: EvoLattice, large language models, program evolution, multi-agent systems, quality-diversity optimization  

<br><br>Summary:  
1. The paper introduces EvoLattice, a novel framework designed to improve the evolution of programs and multi-agent systems using large language models (LLMs).  
2. Unlike traditional overwrite-based mutation methods that maintain only a single candidate and risk destructive edits, EvoLattice represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node contains multiple persistent alternatives.  
3. Each valid path through the DAG defines a distinct executable candidate, enabling a large combinatorial search space while sharing structural components to avoid duplication.  
4. EvoLattice supports fine-grained evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths it appears in, generating statistics that link local design choices to global performance, thus providing dense feedback for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning.  
5. Structural correctness is assured by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that maintains acyclicity and dependency consistency without relying on the LLM.  
6. The framework naturally extends to agent evolution by treating alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors.  
7. Experimental results in program synthesis and meta-learning demonstrate that EvoLattice achieves greater stability, expressivity, and improvement trajectories than prior methods, with evolutionary dynamics resembling quality-diversity optimization emerging intrinsically from its internal representation rather than from external archives. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evolve programs and multi-agent systems, yet most existing approaches rely on overwrite-based mutations that maintain only a single candidate at a time. Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.

<div> long context, inference-time compute, static self-attention, score dilution, targeted gradient updates  

<br><br>Summary:  
This article investigates the challenges and limitations of using large language models (LLMs) with very long context lengths, highlighting that although LLMs can process millions of tokens, they often fail to effectively utilize the entirety of such extended contexts. It shows that current inference-time strategies, which rely on additional computation such as generating "thinking tokens" to enhance performance in multi-step reasoning, offer rapidly diminishing returns and ultimately fail when dealing with long contexts. The authors identify "score dilution," an inherent problem in static self-attention mechanisms, as a primary cause of these failures. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that existing inference strategies struggle to retrieve relevant long-context information under specific conditions. To address these issues, they propose a simple yet effective method: targeted gradient updates applied to the given context during inference. This approach provably overcomes the score dilution problem and limitations of static self-attention. Experiments show this method significantly improves performance across models and benchmarks, with notable gains of 12.6 and 14.1 percentage points for the Qwen3-4B model on subsets of LongBench-v2 and ZeroScrolls benchmarks respectively. The key practical insight is that a small amount of context-specific training during inference is a more efficient and effective use of compute than merely increasing inference-time token generation. <div>

Abstract: Progress on training and architecture strategies has enabled LLMs with millions of tokens in context length. However, empirical evidence suggests that such long-context LLMs can consume far more text than they can reliably use. On the other hand, it has been shown that inference-time compute can be used to scale performance of LLMs, often by generating thinking tokens, on challenging tasks involving multi-step reasoning. Through controlled experiments on sandbox long-context tasks, we find that such inference-time strategies show rapidly diminishing returns and fail at long context. We attribute these failures to score dilution, a phenomenon inherent to static self-attention. Further, we show that current inference-time strategies cannot retrieve relevant long-context signals under certain conditions. We propose a simple method that, through targeted gradient updates on the given context, provably overcomes limitations of static self-attention. We find that this shift in how inference-time compute is spent leads to consistently large performance improvements across models and long-context benchmarks. Our method leads to large 12.6 and 14.1 percentage point improvements for Qwen3-4B on average across subsets of LongBench-v2 and ZeroScrolls benchmarks. The takeaway is practical: for long context, a small amount of context-specific training is a better use of inference compute than current inference-time scaling strategies like producing more thinking tokens.

<div> Keywords: generative AI, real-time deployment, multi-user scalability, computational complexity, video translation<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the system-level challenges in deploying cascaded generative AI pipelines for real-time applications such as video translation, focusing on latency and scalability issues. It identifies that sequential model inference leads to high cumulative latency and that computational demands scale quadratically ($\mathcal{O}(N^2)$) with the number of users, limiting multi-user video conferencing viability. To overcome these bottlenecks, the authors propose a practical system-level framework featuring a turn-taking mechanism that reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear in multi-user settings, improving scalability. Additionally, a segmented processing protocol is introduced to manage inference latency, maintaining a perceptually real-time user experience. The proposed architecture was implemented as a proof-of-concept pipeline and evaluated across various hardware tiers, including commodity (NVIDIA RTX 4060), cloud (NVIDIA T4), and enterprise (NVIDIA A100) GPUs, demonstrating real-time throughput performance ($\tau < 1.0$) on modern platforms. A subjective user study confirmed that users accept an initial, predictable processing delay in exchange for smooth, uninterrupted playback, validating the user experience aspect. Overall, the work delivers a validated end-to-end design offering a practical roadmap for scalable, real-time generative AI deployment in multilingual communication platforms. <div>

Abstract: The real-time deployment of cascaded generative AI pipelines for applications like video translation is constrained by significant system-level challenges. These include the cumulative latency of sequential model inference and the quadratic ($\mathcal{O}(N^2)$) computational complexity that renders multi-user video conferencing applications unscalable. This paper proposes and evaluates a practical system-level framework designed to mitigate these critical bottlenecks. The proposed architecture incorporates a turn-taking mechanism to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear in multi-user scenarios, and a segmented processing protocol to manage inference latency for a perceptually real-time experience. We implement a proof-of-concept pipeline and conduct a rigorous performance analysis across a multi-tiered hardware setup, including commodity (NVIDIA RTX 4060), cloud (NVIDIA T4), and enterprise (NVIDIA A100) GPUs. Our objective evaluation demonstrates that the system achieves real-time throughput ($\tau < 1.0$) on modern hardware. A subjective user study further validates the approach, showing that a predictable, initial processing delay is highly acceptable to users in exchange for a smooth, uninterrupted playback experience. The work presents a validated, end-to-end system design that offers a practical roadmap for deploying scalable, real-time generative AI applications in multilingual communication platforms.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific exploration, but most methods automate procedural tasks without engaging in scientific reasoning, limiting autonomy in discovery. We introduce Materials Agents for Simulation and Theory in Electronic-structure Reasoning (MASTER), an active learning framework where large language models autonomously design, execute, and interpret atomistic simulations. In MASTER, a multimodal system translates natural language into density functional theory workflows, while higher-level reasoning agents guide discovery through a hierarchy of strategies, including a single agent baseline and three multi-agent approaches: peer review, triage-ranking, and triage-forms. Across two chemical applications, CO adsorption on Cu-surface transition metal (M) adatoms and on M-N-C catalysts, reasoning-driven exploration reduces required atomistic simulations by up to 90% relative to trial-and-error selection. Reasoning trajectories reveal chemically grounded decisions that cannot be explained by stochastic sampling or semantic bias. Altogether, multi-agent collaboration accelerates materials discovery and marks a new paradigm for autonomous scientific exploration.

Abstract: Current multimodal large lanauge models possess strong perceptual and reasoning capabilities, however high computational and memory requirements make them difficult to deploy directly on on-device environments. While small-parameter models are progressively endowed with strong general capabilities, standard Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders remain a critical bottleneck, suffering from excessive latency and memory consumption when processing high-resolution inputs.To address these challenges, we introduce HyperVL, an efficient multimodal large language model tailored for on-device inference. HyperVL adopts an image-tiling strategy to cap peak memory usage and incorporates two novel techniques: (1) a Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC) that adaptively predicts optimal encoding resolutions to eliminate redundant computation, and (2) Dual Consistency Learning (DCL), which aligns multi-scale ViT encoders within a unified framework, enabling dynamic switching between visual branches under a shared LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperVL achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly significantly reduces latency and power consumption on real mobile devices, demonstrating its practicality for on-device multimodal inference.

<div> Keywords: Multi-Agent Systems, agentic AI, structured framework, composable components, cost-efficient search<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the automatic search for Multi-Agent Systems, an important topic in agentic AI research. Unlike previous methods that primarily use large language models (LLMs) to perform free-form searches across a vast code space, the authors propose a structured framework. Their framework decomposes the search space into a fixed set of simple, composable components, promoting modularity and interpretability. Despite giving up some generative flexibility afforded by LLMs during the candidate generation stage, their approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming prior LLM-based methods on four out of five benchmarks spanning two domains: mathematics and question answering. An additional benefit of this structured method is that the search process is more cost-efficient, reducing computational and resource overhead. The resulting multi-agent systems generated by this method have simpler, more interpretable logic, which aids in understanding and potential further refinement. Overall, the work presents a compelling alternative to free-form LLM search by leveraging a more constrained but effective compositional search strategy for developing multi-agent AI systems. <div>

<div> Audio-Visual Speech Recognition, robustness, hierarchical approach, model scalability, foundation models<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This dissertation addresses the challenges faced by Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) systems in real-world environments, focusing on significant performance degradation due to unpredictable acoustic noise and visual interference. It proposes a systematic, hierarchical approach to improve robustness and scalability at three levels: representation, architecture, and system. At the representation level, the work develops a unified model designed to learn audio-visual features that are inherently robust against diverse real-world corruptions, enabling generalization to new environments without relying on specialized modules. For architectural scalability, the dissertation explores methods to efficiently increase model capacity while ensuring adaptive and reliable use of multimodal inputs, introducing a framework that dynamically allocates computational resources based on input characteristics. At the system level, it integrates modular methods with large-scale foundation models to leverage their cognitive and generative capabilities, thus enhancing final recognition accuracy. By addressing these three levels systematically, the dissertation aims to create a next-generation AVSR system that is robust, scalable, and highly reliable in practical, real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: The practical deployment of Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) systems is fundamentally challenged by significant performance degradation in real-world environments, characterized by unpredictable acoustic noise and visual interference. This dissertation posits that a systematic, hierarchical approach is essential to overcome these challenges, achieving the robust scalability at the representation, architecture, and system levels. At the representation level, we investigate methods for building a unified model that learns audio-visual features inherently robust to diverse real-world corruptions, thereby enabling generalization to new environments without specialized modules. To address architectural scalability, we explore how to efficiently expand model capacity while ensuring the adaptive and reliable use of multimodal inputs, developing a framework that intelligently allocates computational resources based on the input characteristics. Finally, at the system level, we present methods to expand the system's functionality through modular integration with large-scale foundation models, leveraging their powerful cognitive and generative capabilities to maximize final recognition accuracy. By systematically providing solutions at each of these three levels, this dissertation aims to build a next-generation, robust, and scalable AVSR system with high reliability in real-world applications.

<div> Keywords: SPARQL-LLM, large language models, federated queries, bioinformatics knowledge graphs, natural language to SPARQL  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper presents SPARQL-LLM, an open-source, triplestore-agnostic system designed to generate SPARQL queries from natural language input using large language models enhanced by lightweight metadata. The architecture includes components for metadata indexing, prompt construction, and query generation/execution, enabling adaptability across diverse data sources. It is evaluated on a multilingual benchmark and three major bioinformatics knowledge graphs, demonstrating a 24% improvement in F1 score over previous state-of-the-art methods. SPARQL-LLM supports federated query execution, addressing the challenge of querying distributed knowledge graphs effectively. Additionally, it achieves significantly faster query generation—up to 36 times faster than competing approaches—making it suitable for real-time applications. Cost-efficiency is another highlight, with a maximum expense of just $0.01 per generated query, which is essential for scalable deployment. The model supports multiple high-resource languages, including English and Spanish, and effectively handles complex queries common in bioinformatics. A practical application of SPARQL-LLM is deployed on decentralized knowledge graphs via the interface at https://www.expasy.org/chat, illustrating its production readiness and usability for text-to-SPARQL tasks in real-world scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2512.14277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of large language models is contributing to the emergence of novel approaches that promise to better tackle the challenge of generating structured queries, such as SPARQL queries, from natural language. However, these new approaches mostly focus on response accuracy over a single source while ignoring other evaluation criteria, such as federated query capability over distributed data stores, as well as runtime and cost to generate SPARQL queries. Consequently, they are often not production-ready or easy to deploy over (potentially federated) knowledge graphs with good accuracy. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we extend our previous work and describe and systematically evaluate SPARQL-LLM, an open-source and triplestore-agnostic approach, powered by lightweight metadata, that generates SPARQL queries from natural language text. First, we describe its architecture, which consists of dedicated components for metadata indexing, prompt building, and query generation and execution. Then, we evaluate it based on a state-of-the-art challenge with multilingual questions, and a collection of questions from three of the most prevalent knowledge graphs within the field of bioinformatics. Our results demonstrate a substantial increase of 24% in the F1 Score on the state-of-the-art challenge, adaptability to high-resource languages such as English and Spanish, as well as ability to form complex and federated bioinformatics queries. Furthermore, we show that SPARQL-LLM is up to 36x faster than other systems participating in the challenge, while costing a maximum of $0.01 per question, making it suitable for real-time, low-cost text-to-SPARQL applications. One such application deployed over real-world decentralized knowledge graphs can be found at https://www.expasy.org/chat.

<div> Keywords: In-context learning, Cognitive Load Theory, positional encoding, RePo mechanism, large language models<br><br>Summary:<br>In-context learning is essential for large language models (LLMs), but current positional encoding methods impose a rigid and fixed linear structure that can increase extraneous cognitive load. Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), the paper argues that this fixed structure consumes finite working memory capacity that could otherwise be used for deep reasoning and better attention allocation. To tackle this issue, the authors propose RePo, a novel differentiable module that dynamically assigns token positions based on contextual dependencies instead of relying on predefined integer indices. RePo reduces extraneous cognitive load by repositioning context tokens in a way that better reflects their intrinsic structure. The method was continually pre-trained on the OLMo-2 1B LLM backbone and evaluated across various tasks. Results show that RePo significantly improves performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context lengths while maintaining competitive results on short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo effectively increases attention on distant but relevant information, assigns positions in dense and non-linear spaces, and captures meaningful contextual relationships. The authors have made their code publicly available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/repo. <div>

Abstract: In-context learning is fundamental to modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, prevailing architectures impose a rigid and fixed contextual structure by assigning linear or constant positional indices. Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_\phi$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

This paper introduces RecGPT-V2, an advanced large language model framework for recommender systems designed to overcome limitations of its predecessor, RecGPT-V1. First, RecGPT-V2 implements a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System to coordinate intent reasoning, reducing cognitive redundancy and computational costs by 60%, while improving exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, it employs a Meta-Prompting framework that dynamically adapts prompts for richer and more diverse explanations, achieving a 7.3% improvement in explanation diversity. Third, the system incorporates constrained reinforcement learning to balance multiple reward signals, resulting in a 24.1% increase in item tag prediction accuracy and a 13.0% rise in explanation acceptance rates. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge evaluation framework breaks down assessments into multi-step reasoning processes, aligning outputs more closely with human preferences. Extensive online A/B testing on the Taobao platform demonstrates commercial benefits, including a 2.98% increase in click-through rate (CTR), 3.71% growth in items per visit (IPV), 2.19% rise in transaction volume (TV), and an 11.46% boost in new effective rate (NER). Overall, RecGPT-V2 proves the feasibility and industrial applicability of scalable LLM-powered intent reasoning in real-world recommender systems. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in transforming recommender systems from implicit behavioral pattern matching to explicit intent reasoning. While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards.
  To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment. Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER. RecGPT-V2 establishes both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of deploying LLM-powered intent reasoning at scale, bridging the gap between cognitive exploration and industrial utility.

<div> Keywords: attention-based encoder-decoder, long-form acoustic encodings, absolute positional encoding, segment concatenation, semantic segmentation<br><br>Summary: This paper addresses the challenge faced by attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models when processing long-form acoustic encodings, highlighting their fundamental incompatibility with such inputs. Firstly, the issue arises because AED models trained on segmented utterances rely on absolute frame position cues that disappear in long segments, causing the model to lose the ability to correctly order acoustic encodings due to the permutation invariance property in cross-attention. To overcome this, the authors propose four key modifications: (1) explicitly injecting absolute positional encodings into the cross-attention mechanism of each decoded segment to retain positional information, (2) training the model on long-form acoustic inputs to remove reliance on implicit position cues, (3) concatenating segments during training to ensure the model can handle diverse segmentation patterns, and (4) introducing semantic segmentation to better align the AED-decoded segments with the segments used during training. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies effectively close the accuracy gap between continuous and segmented acoustic encodings, enabling the AED model’s attention decoder to operate autoregressively on long-form audio without loss of positional ordering or degradation in performance. <div>

Abstract: We address the fundamental incompatibility of attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models with long-form acoustic encodings. AED models trained on segmented utterances learn to encode absolute frame positions by exploiting limited acoustic context beyond segment boundaries, but fail to generalize when decoding long-form segments where these cues vanish. The model loses ability to order acoustic encodings due to permutation invariance of keys and values in cross-attention. We propose four modifications: (1) injecting explicit absolute positional encodings into cross-attention for each decoded segment, (2) long-form training with extended acoustic context to eliminate implicit absolute position encoding, (3) segment concatenation to cover diverse segmentations needed during training, and (4) semantic segmentation to align AED-decoded segments with training segments. We show these modifications close the accuracy gap between continuous and segmented acoustic encodings, enabling auto-regressive use of the attention decoder.

<div> Video Temporal Grounding, Multimodal Large Language Models, TimeLens, Benchmark Re-annotation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper introduces TimeLens, a foundational baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), focusing on optimizing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for VTG. It identifies critical quality concerns in existing VTG benchmarks and addresses these by creating TimeLens-Bench, a carefully re-annotated set of three popular benchmarks using strict quality criteria. The re-annotation resulted in significant changes in model performance rankings, highlighting the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. To combat noisy training data, the authors developed an automated re-annotation pipeline, producing TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. On this data foundation, they investigated algorithmic design principles, discovering effective techniques such as interleaved textual encoding for better time representation. They propose a novel training paradigm, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which is a thinking-free approach paired with carefully crafted training recipes. The TimeLens family of models achieves state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and surpasses proprietary models like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. The paper includes plans to release all codes, datasets, and models to promote further research. <div>

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel method but instead establishes a straightforward, incremental, yet essential baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), a core capability in video understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

<div> Keywords: spatio-temporal knowledge graphs, question answering, dataset, reasoning, embeddings  

<br><br>Summary:  
Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by incorporating temporal and spatial information, allowing for more precise reasoning over questions that depend on both time and location. However, research in spatio-temporal knowledge graph question answering (STKGQA) has been limited, primarily due to the absence of datasets that include both temporal and spatial data, as well as methods capable of handling implicit reasoning involving these aspects. To address this, the authors introduce STQAD, the first extensive benchmark consisting of 10,000 natural language questions which require combined temporal and spatial reasoning, constructed using real-world facts to ensure practical relevance. Experimental evaluations show that current KGQA techniques perform poorly on STQAD because they fail to effectively model the interactions between temporal and spatial features. In response, the authors propose STCQA, a novel method that jointly embeds temporal and spatial features into knowledge graph representations and employs dynamic, constraint-aware filtering during answer selection. STCQA significantly outperforms existing baseline methods, establishing a strong foundation for future research in complex spatio-temporal question answering and providing a valuable resource for the community. <div>

Abstract: Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) enhance traditional KGs by integrating temporal and spatial annotations, enabling precise reasoning over questions with spatio-temporal dependencies. Despite their potential, research on spatio-temporal knowledge graph question answering (STKGQA) remains limited. This is primarily due to the lack of datasets that simultaneously contain spatio-temporal information, as well as methods capable of handling implicit spatio-temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the spatio-temporal question answering dataset (STQAD), the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 10,000 natural language questions that require both temporal and spatial reasoning. STQAD is constructed with real-world facts containing spatio-temporal information, ensuring that the dataset reflects practical scenarios. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that existing KGQA methods underperform on STQAD, primarily due to their inability to model spatio-temporal interactions. To address this, we propose the spatio-temporal complex question answering (STCQA) method, which jointly embeds temporal and spatial features into KG representations and dynamically filters answers through constraint-aware reasoning. STCQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Our work not only provides a valuable resource for future research but also advances the field by offering a robust baseline for answering complex spatio-temporal questions.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, long-term conversations, memory retention, emotionally arousing memories, user experience<br><br>Summary:  
1. This article addresses the challenge of degrading retrieval accuracy in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots as memory load increases over long-term conversations.  
2. The authors propose LUFY, a novel method inspired by psychological findings, which focuses on retaining only emotionally arousing memories and forgets the vast majority of conversational content—less than 10%.  
3. LUFY aims to reduce memory load while maintaining important context, thereby improving the retrieval quality and overall chatbot performance during extended interactions.  
4. To evaluate LUFY, the researchers conducted an extensive user experiment involving participants interacting with three types of RAG chatbots for two hours each, spread over four sessions—totalling eight hours per participant and representing the longest assessment of chatbot long-term capabilities so far.  
5. Results from the study show that prioritizing emotionally significant memories while discarding non-essential conversation parts significantly enhances user experience and the effectiveness of long-term conversational AI systems.  
6. This work highlights the importance of selective forgetting as a crucial mechanism for sustaining efficient and meaningful long-term interactions. The authors provide code and datasets to support further research at the provided GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing long-term conversations, the increasing memory load as conversations progress degrades retrieval accuracy. Drawing on psychological insights, we propose LUFY, a simple yet effective method that focuses on emotionally arousing memories and retains less than 10% of the conversation. In the user experiment, participants interacted with three types of RAG chatbots, each for 2 hours over 4 sessions, marking the most extensive assessment of a chatbot's long-term capabilities to date -- more than four times longer than any existing benchmark. The results demonstrate that prioritizing arousing memories while forgetting the majority of the conversation significantly enhances user experience. This study pushes the frontier of long-term conversations and highlights the importance of forgetting unimportant parts of conversations. Code and Dataset: https://github.com/ryuichi-sumida/LUFY

<div> Privacy Leakage, Context Influence, Language Models, Differential Privacy, Contextual Knowledge<br><br>Summary: Language models (LMs) combine their parametric knowledge with augmented contextual knowledge for tasks like question answering, but this can risk leaking private information. Existing methods that compare LM outputs directly to contexts tend to overestimate privacy risks because the LM's parametric knowledge may already include the contextual information. To address this, the paper introduces a novel metric called *context influence*, grounded in differential privacy principles, which estimates privacy leakage by measuring how different subsets of context affect an LM's responses while isolating the LM's inherent knowledge. The study reveals that privacy leakage primarily occurs when contextual information is out of distribution relative to the LM's parametric knowledge. Experiments show that context influence accurately highlights privacy leakage specifically attributable to the augmented context rather than the model itself. Furthermore, the research investigates how various factors, including model size, context length, and the position of generated tokens, impact the degree of context privacy leakage. The findings provide practical guidance for users and developers to better understand and manage privacy risks when incorporating external contextual knowledge in language model applications. <div>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) rely on their parametric knowledge augmented with relevant contextual knowledge for certain tasks, such as question answering. However, the contextual knowledge can contain private information that may be leaked when answering queries, and estimating this privacy leakage is not well understood. A straightforward approach of directly comparing an LM's output to the contexts can overestimate the privacy risk, since the LM's parametric knowledge might already contain the augmented contextual knowledge. To this end, we introduce *context influence*, a metric that builds on differential privacy, a widely-adopted privacy notion, to estimate the privacy leakage of contextual knowledge during decoding. Our approach effectively measures how each subset of the context influences an LM's response while separating the specific parametric knowledge of the LM. Using our context influence metric, we demonstrate that context privacy leakage occurs when contextual knowledge is out of distribution with respect to parametric knowledge. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate how context influence properly attributes the privacy leakage to augmented contexts, and we evaluate how factors -- such as model size, context size, generation position, etc. -- affect context privacy leakage. The practical implications of our results will inform practitioners of the privacy risk associated with augmented contextual knowledge.

<title>Why Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Enables MLLMs Preserve Prior Knowledge Better: A Data Perspective</title>

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL series. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly but maintains prior knowledge. We study this phenomenon through learning dynamics by examining both the magnitude and direction of how training data influence prior knowledge. Our analysis shows that RFT mainly reinforces correct samples naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, leading to weaker interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, training on RFT-simulated rollouts, which exert a small magnitude of influence and are well aligned in direction to prior knowledge, allows SFT to preserve prior knowledge better while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that distribution of training data, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However, constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided \underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

Abstract: To address the severe data scarcity in Tibetan, a low-resource language spoken by over six million people, we introduce TIBSTC-CoT, the large-scale, multi-domain Tibetan dataset automatically constructed via chain-of-thought prompting with large language models (LLMs). TIBSTC-CoT establishes a scalable and reproducible framework for dataset creation in low-resource settings, covering diverse domains and reasoning patterns essential for language understanding and generation. Building on this dataset, we develop the Sunshine-thinking LLM family, a series of Tibetan-centric LLMs equipped with chain-of-thought capabilities. Trained entirely on TIBSTC-CoT, Sunshine-thinking has demonstrated strong reasoning and generation performance, comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multilingual LLMs. Our work marks a significant step toward inclusive AI by enabling high-quality Tibetan language processing through both resource creation and model innovation.

<title>Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions. Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce \textbf{Latent Self-Consistency (LSC)}, which selects the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. LSC's lightweight forward processing of summary tokens only introduces negligible runtime overhead (at most $0.9\%$) on top of standard decoding of the base LLM, and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU, TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC, and WUCS on both short-form and long-form on average performance, while adding negligible computational overhead on vanilla inference. These results position LSC as a reliable consistency-selection method that works effectively across various answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated confidence estimates, maintaining low expected calibration error across both answer formats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in various tasks and applications. However, despite their wide capabilities, they are shown to lack cultural alignment \citep{ryan-etal-2024-unintended, alkhamissi-etal-2024-investigating} and produce biased generations \cite{naous-etal-2024-beer} due to a lack of cultural knowledge and competence. Evaluation of LLMs for cultural awareness and alignment is particularly challenging due to the lack of proper evaluation metrics and unavailability of culturally grounded datasets representing the vast complexity of cultures at the regional and sub-regional levels. Existing datasets for culture specific items (CSIs) focus primarily on concepts at the regional level and may contain false positives. To address this issue, we introduce a novel CSI dataset for Indian culture, belonging to 17 cultural facets. The dataset comprises ~8k cultural concepts from 36 sub-regions. To measure the cultural competence of LLMs on a cultural text adaptation task, we evaluate the adaptations using the CSIs created, LLM as Judge, and human evaluations from diverse socio-demographic region. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analysis demonstrating selective sub-regional coverage and surface-level adaptations across all considered LLMs. Our dataset is available here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nlip/DIWALI, project webpage https://nlip-lab.github.io/nlip/publications/diwali/, and our codebase with model outputs can be found here: https://github.com/pramitsahoo/culture-evaluation

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

Abstract: Evaluating LLMs' instruction-following ability in multi-topic dialogues is essential yet challenging. Existing benchmarks are limited to a fixed number of turns, susceptible to saturation and failing to account for users' interactive experience. In this work, we propose a novel framework backed by a three-layer tracking mechanism and a query synthesis agent to mimic sequential user behaviors. Incorporating Flow Theory, we introduce process-centric metrics and terminate a conversational evaluation only upon exhausting user patience. Upon this framework, we present EvolIF, an evolving benchmark covering 12 constraint groups. Results indicate that GPT-5 excels, sustaining 14 turns with 66.40% robustness. It outperforms Gemini-3.0-Pro by a margin of 5.59%, while other models trail behind. Resources are available at https://github.com/JiaQiSJTU/EvolvingInstructionFollowing.

Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models, typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) are achieving state-of-the-art performance in many different downstream tasks. However, the increasing urgency of data privacy puts pressure on practitioners to train LLMs with Differential Privacy (DP) on private data. Concurrently, the exponential growth in parameter size of LLMs necessitates model compression before deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained devices or latency-sensitive applications. Differential privacy and model compression generally must trade off utility loss to achieve their objectives. Moreover, simultaneously applying both schemes can compound the utility degradation. To this end, we propose DistilDP: a novel differentially private knowledge distillation algorithm that exploits synthetic data generated by a differentially private teacher LLM. The knowledge of a teacher LLM is transferred onto the student in two ways: one way from the synthetic data itself -- the hard labels, and the other way by the output distribution of the teacher evaluated on the synthetic data -- the soft labels. Furthermore, if the teacher and student share a similar architectural structure, we can further distill knowledge by aligning the hidden representations between both. Our experimental results demonstrate that DistilDP can substantially improve the utility over existing baselines, at least $9.0$ PPL on the Big Patent dataset, with strong privacy parameters, $\epsilon=2$. These promising results progress privacy-preserving compression of autoregressive LLMs. Our code can be accessed here: https://github.com/james-flemings/dp_compress.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is essential for improving interaction quality and safety by ensuring outputs better reflect human values. A promising strategy involves Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), starting with collecting and ranking responses generated by a supervised fine-tuning model to refine alignment. Existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) focus on pairwise comparisons, categorizing responses into preferred and less preferred pairs and optimizing pairwise margins. However, this pairwise approach cannot capture the holistic ranking relationships among multiple responses or effectively leverage the rich preference information available in list-wise comparisons. To address this challenge, this paper introduces \underline{D}irect \underline{R}anking \underline{P}reference \underline{O}ptimization (DRPO), a novel method that views human preference alignment as a Learning-to-Rank (LTR) task. Unlike pairwise methods, DRPO optimizes the preference ranking of entire response lists by computing holistic utility scores through NDCG, a standard LTR metric. To enable end-to-end optimization with the non-differentiable NDCG, we propose diffNDCG loss, a differentiable approximation facilitated by a sorting network. Furthermore, we introduce a novel margin-based Adaptive Rank Policy Score to enhance the discriminative quality of generated responses. Extensive experiments have shown that DRPO outperforms existing methods, enhancing the quality of the generated responses.

Abstract: Repository-level code translation refers to translating an entire code repository from one programming language to another while preserving the functionality of the source repository. Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such code translators. However, previous benchmarks mostly provide fine-grained samples, focusing at either code snippet, function, or file-level code translation. Such benchmarks do not accurately reflect real-world demands, where entire repositories often need to be translated, involving longer code length and more complex functionalities. To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, named RepoTransBench, which is a real-world multilingual repository-level code translation benchmark featuring 1,897 real-world repository samples across 13 language pairs with automatically executable test suites. Besides, we introduce RepoTransAgent, a general agent framework to perform repository-level code translation. We evaluate both our benchmark's challenges and agent's effectiveness using several methods and backbone LLMs, revealing that repository-level translation remains challenging, where the best-performing method achieves only a 32.8% success rate. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that translation difficulty varies significantly by language pair direction, with dynamic-to-static language translation being much more challenging than the reverse direction (achieving below 10% vs. static-to-dynamic at 45-63%). Finally, we conduct a detailed error analysis and highlight current LLMs' deficiencies in repository-level code translation, which could provide a reference for further improvements. We provide the code and data at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/RepoTransBench.

Abstract: The integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into corporate decision-making is a fundamental aspect of sustainable finance. However, ensuring that business practices align with evolving regulatory frameworks remains a persistent challenge. AI-driven solutions for automatically assessing the alignment of sustainability reports and non-financial disclosures with specific ESG activities could greatly support this process. Yet, this task remains complex due to the limitations of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-specific contexts and the scarcity of structured, high-quality datasets. In this paper, we investigate the ability of current-generation LLMs to identify text related to environmental activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their performance can be significantly enhanced through fine-tuning on a combination of original and synthetically generated data. To this end, we introduce ESG-Activities, a benchmark dataset containing 1,325 labelled text segments classified according to the EU ESG taxonomy. Our experimental results show that fine-tuning on ESG-Activities significantly enhances classification accuracy, with open models such as Llama 7B and Gemma 7B outperforming large proprietary solutions in specific configurations. These findings have important implications for financial analysts, policymakers, and AI researchers seeking to enhance ESG transparency and compliance through advanced natural language processing techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to materials science questions, including literature comprehension, property prediction, materials discovery and alloy design. At the same time, a wide range of physics-based computational approaches have been developed in which materials properties can be calculated. Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA) benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better. MatTools provides a standardized framework for assessing and improving LLM capabilities for materials science tool applications, facilitating the development of more effective AI systems for materials science and general scientific research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained models with phonetic supervision have demonstrated their advantages for crosslingual speech recognition in data efficiency and information sharing across languages. However, a limitation is that a pronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech recognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation lexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being treated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a speech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model. To jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic approximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance particularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Furthermore, we propose marginal likelihood scoring (MLS) decoding to align inference with the training objective and P2G augmentation to improve the robustness of P2G mapping. Based on the Whistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are conducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of phoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5% error rate reductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword or full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain adaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms the standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the G2P model by 9% error rate reductions. To facilitate reproducibility and encourage further exploration in this field, we open-source the JSA-SPG training code and complete pipeline.

Abstract: We construct evaluation tasks where extending the reasoning length of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) deteriorates performance, exhibiting an inverse scaling relationship between test-time compute and accuracy. Our evaluation tasks span four categories: simple counting tasks with distractors, regression tasks with spurious features, deduction tasks with constraint tracking, and advanced AI risks. We identify five distinct failure modes when models reason for longer: 1) Claude models become increasingly distracted by irrelevant information; 2) OpenAI o-series models resist distractors but overfit to problem framings; 3) models shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations; 4) all models show difficulties in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks; and 5) extended reasoning may amplify concerning behaviors, with Claude Sonnet 4 showing increased expressions of self-preservation. These findings suggest that while test-time compute scaling remains promising for improving model capabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns. Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating models across diverse reasoning lengths to identify and address these failure modes in LRMs.

Abstract: Computer Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts both textual descriptions and sketches as input, engaging in interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel Explicit Context Imperative Paradigm (ECIP), the agent generates high-quality CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against itself-a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following, mathematics, and coding benchmarks show that pretrained models can be effectively improved with self-play alone.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of agent architectures and effectively identifying problematic agents when failures occur are crucial challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS). Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.

<title>PAT: Accelerating LLM Decoding via Prefix-Aware Attention with Resource Efficient Multi-Tile Kernel</title>

Abstract: LLM serving is increasingly dominated by decode attention, which is a memory-bound operation due to massive KV cache loading from global memory. Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: one-query-per-CTA execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while one-size-fits-all tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.
  This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 53.5% on average and TPOT by 17.0-93.1% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels. PAT's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/flashserve/PAT.

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study addresses the challenge of translating Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) texts, which are rich in metaphorical and metonymic language, into English. 1) It highlights that existing English translations mostly use literal rendering, which hampers comprehension and application by readers unfamiliar with the original conceptual framework. 2) The researchers employed a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework, focusing on four key passages from the Huangdi Neijing, a foundational TCM text. 3) Using prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, the DeepSeek V3.1 model was guided to identify metaphors and metonymies in the source and render them more effectively in English. 4) For evaluation, advanced LLMs (ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro) simulated different user perspectives to score translations along five cognitive dimensions, supplemented by interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). 5) Results demonstrated that prompt-adjusted LLM translations outperformed both baseline model outputs and human translations consistently, revealing effective strategies for transferring metaphor and metonymy and exposing different cognitive preferences between readers and translators. Ultimately, the study proposes a replicable, cognitively informed HITL method for translating ancient, dense conceptual texts like those in TCM. <div>

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory is built on imagistic thinking, in which medical principles and diagnostic and therapeutic logic are structured through metaphor and metonymy. However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences. This study provides a cognitive, efficient, and replicable HITL methodological pathway for the translation of ancient, concept-dense texts such as TCM.

<div> Deep Research Agents, report synthesis, benchmark, failure taxonomy, evidence integration<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the limitations of current Deep Research Agents (DRAs) which aim to automate the production of analyst-level research reports but have mostly been tested on question-answering tasks rather than comprehensive report generation. The authors argue that existing benchmarks for report synthesis are inadequate due to task complexity and subjective evaluation metrics. To overcome these issues, they introduce FINDER, a new benchmark featuring 100 human-curated research tasks and 419 structured checklist items that ensure standardized report structure, analytical depth, and factual accuracy. Using approximately 1,000 reports from leading DRAs, the study also presents DEFT, the first detailed failure taxonomy for DRAs. DEFT identifies 14 specific failure modes related to reasoning, retrieval, and generation processes, developed through a rigorous human and large language model co-annotation process with inter-annotator reliability checks. Experimental results show that current DRAs generally understand tasks well but fail mainly in integrating evidence, verifying facts, and maintaining reasoning during planning stages. This work highlights critical challenges facing DRAs and provides tools and insights to guide future improvements in automated research report generation. <div>

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) aim to automatically produce analyst-level reports through iterative information retrieval and synthesis. However, most existing DRAs were validated on question-answering benchmarks, while research on generating comprehensive reports remains overlooked. Worse, current benchmarks for report synthesis suffer from task complexity and subjective metrics -- this fails to reflect user demands and limits the practical utility of generated reports. To address these gaps, we present Fine-grained DEepResearch bench (FINDER), an enhanced benchmark consisting of 100 human-curated research tasks with 419 structured checklist items that standardize report structure, analytical depth, and factual grounding. Based on approximately 1,000 reports produced by mainstream DRAs, we further propose Deep rEsearch Failure Taxonomy (DEFT), the first failure taxonomy for deep research agents. DEFT contains 14 fine-grained failure modes across reasoning, retrieval, and generation, and is built upon grounded theory with human-LLM co-annotating and inter-annotator reliability validation. Our experimental findings reveal that current DRAs struggle not with task comprehension but with evidence integration, verification, and reasoning-resilient planning.

<div> Keywords: Visual Place Recognition, Large Language Models, urban flooding, attention-guided descriptor enhancement, crowdsourced imagery  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces VPR-AttLLM, a novel framework that enhances Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models by integrating the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. The method addresses the challenges posed by crowdsourced street-view images from social media, which often suffer from lack of reliable geographic metadata and visual distortions due to domain shifts. VPR-AttLLM identifies location-informative regions within urban scenes while suppressing transient visual noise, significantly improving retrieval accuracy without the need for retraining or additional data. The framework is evaluated on multiple extended benchmarks, including SF-XL enriched with real flood imagery, synthetic flooding scenarios, Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset featuring diverse cityscapes. When integrated with three state-of-the-art VPR models—CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD—VPR-AttLLM consistently delivers relative recall improvements between 1-3%, peaking at 8% on the most challenging real flood images. Beyond performance gains, the study demonstrates a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval, embedding urban perception principles into attention mechanisms to bridge human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, robustness across sources, and interpretability make it promising for scalable urban monitoring and crisis image geo-localization. <div>

Abstract: Crowdsourced street-view imagery from social media provides valuable real-time visual evidence of urban flooding and other crisis events, yet it often lacks reliable geographic metadata for emergency response. Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery.

<div> Chain-of-Thought, latent-space thinking, reinforcement learning, mathematical reasoning, Coconut approach<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning traditionally operates in discrete language space, which can be inefficient due to tokens enforcing linguistic rules unnecessary for reasoning.<br /><br />2. Latent-space thinking proposes reasoning in the continuous embedding space to improve efficiency but existing methods generally fail in complex domains like mathematical reasoning.<br /><br />3.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning typically utilizes the discrete language space for thinking, which is inherently inefficient, as many generated tokens only enforce linguistic rules that are not required for reasoning. To bypass this, latent-space thinking allows models to think using the continuous embedding space. While existing methods for training those models show domain-specific gains, they fail to maintain performance in complex tasks, such as mathematical reasoning. We experimentally demonstrate that the Coconut approach, a form of supervised fine-tuning for latent-space thinking, is highly sensitive to design choices and exhibits several inherent limitations. To address these issues, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) techniques -- an underexplored direction in latent-space thinking -- including GRPO and design a novel Latent RL method for directly optimizing the latent thinking steps. Our experimental results reveal that these RL-trained models still lag behind traditional language-space CoT models in the mathematical reasoning domain. We make our codebase publicly available.

Abstract: Automated document layout analysis remains a major challenge for low-resource, non-Latin scripts. Khmer is a language spoken daily by over 17 million people in Cambodia, receiving little attention in the development of document AI tools. The lack of dedicated resources is particularly acute for business documents, which are critical for both public administration and private enterprise. To address this gap, we present \textbf{KH-FUNSD}, the first publicly available, hierarchically annotated dataset for Khmer form document understanding, including receipts, invoices, and quotations. Our annotation framework features a three-level design: (1) region detection that divides each document into core zones such as header, form field, and footer; (2) FUNSD-style annotation that distinguishes questions, answers, headers, and other key entities, together with their relationships; and (3) fine-grained classification that assigns specific semantic roles, such as field labels, values, headers, footers, and symbols. This multi-level approach supports both comprehensive layout analysis and precise information extraction. We benchmark several leading models, providing the first set of baseline results for Khmer business documents, and discuss the distinct challenges posed by non-Latin, low-resource scripts. The KH-FUNSD dataset and documentation will be available at URL.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, calibration, confidence alignment, Direct Preference Optimization, model transparency  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of producing trustworthy and reliable Large Language Models (LLMs) by focusing on calibration, which aims to align the model's expressed confidence with the actual likelihood that its responses are correct or desirable. It identifies a key problem: internal confidence measures derived from token probabilities do not align well with the model’s verbalized confidence, causing misleading calibration outcomes across different methods. To tackle this, the authors propose Direct Confidence Alignment (DCA), a novel method that uses Direct Preference Optimization to directly align an LLM’s verbalized confidence with its internal confidence rather than grounded accuracy. This approach is intended to enhance model transparency and reliability by reducing discrepancies between the two confidence types. The method is evaluated on multiple open-weight LLMs using diverse datasets, demonstrating improvements in alignment metrics for certain architectures and reducing inconsistencies in confidence expression. Additionally, the paper introduces three new calibration error-based metrics to assess alignment more effectively. Nonetheless, the results also indicate that DCA is not universally effective, performing poorly on some models, which underscores the necessity for more model-aware, tailored approaches to achieve interpretable and trustworthy LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2512.11998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Producing trustworthy and reliable Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important as their usage becomes more widespread. Calibration seeks to achieve this by improving the alignment between the model's confidence and the actual likelihood of its responses being correct or desirable. However, it has been observed that the internal confidence of a model, derived from token probabilities, is not well aligned with its verbalized confidence, leading to misleading results with different calibration methods. In this paper, we propose Direct Confidence Alignment (DCA), a method using Direct Preference Optimization to align an LLM's verbalized confidence with its internal confidence rather than ground-truth accuracy, enhancing model transparency and reliability by ensuring closer alignment between the two confidence measures. We evaluate DCA across multiple open-weight LLMs on a wide range of datasets. To further assess this alignment, we also introduce three new calibration error-based metrics. Our results show that DCA improves alignment metrics on certain model architectures, reducing inconsistencies in a model's confidence expression. However, we also show that it can be ineffective on others, highlighting the need for more model-aware approaches in the pursuit of more interpretable and trustworthy LLMs.

<div> Keywords: large language models, KV cache compression, long-context reasoning, eviction strategies, decoding-enabled SnapKV<br /><br />Summary: Large language models (LLMs) face memory bottlenecks due to the KV cache growing linearly with context length, which speeds up attention computations but consumes significant memory. Various compression algorithms have been developed to address this issue by evicting less important tokens, mainly during the prefill phase when processing long prompt contexts. However, these strategies have not been thoroughly evaluated on long-decoding reasoning tasks that require multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, such as benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500. This study benchmarks several popular KV cache compression strategies specifically on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning model Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, it is found that no single compression strategy performs best across all datasets, indicating dataset-dependent effectiveness. Notably, for reasoning models, the H2O method and a new decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV outperform other methods, highlighting the importance of heavy-hitter token tracking during reasoning. The research also reveals that eviction strategies under tight memory constraints can permit longer reasoning traces but involve a trade-off between cache size and inference cost, suggesting that careful strategy selection depends on the specific application and resource budget. <div>
arXiv:2512.12008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on long-context tasks, but are often bottlenecked by memory constraints. Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs.

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating accuracy and reliability in In-Car Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA) systems, which enable seamless voice interaction.  
2. It investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with advanced prompting methods and multi-agent approaches to assess whether ConvQA responses align with user utterances, especially for venue recommendations under user constraints and situational context.  
3. The evaluation utilizes synthetically generated user utterances alongside both correct and failure-containing system responses to measure utterance-response coherence.  
4. Multiple prompting techniques are tested, including input-output, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and multi-agent prompting, across 13 reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs from various providers such as OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, and Meta.  
5. Results show small non-reasoning models benefit greatly from advanced prompting, particularly multi-agent prompting, while reasoning models consistently outperform non-reasoning ones, with the best result using single-agent prompting with self-consistency.  
6. DeepSeek-R1 achieves a near-perfect F1-score of 0.99 at very low cost per request, and the non-reasoning DeepSeek-V3 model strikes the best balance between effectiveness and cost-time efficiency.  
7. Overall, the study demonstrates that LLM-based evaluation is a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate alternative to traditional human evaluations for benchmarking contextual understanding in ConvQA systems. <div>

Abstract: In-Car Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA) systems significantly enhance user experience by enabling seamless voice interactions. However, assessing their accuracy and reliability remains a challenge. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside advanced prompting techniques and agent-based methods to evaluate the extent to which ConvQA system responses adhere to user utterances. The focus lies on contextual understanding and the ability to provide accurate venue recommendations considering user constraints and situational context. To evaluate utterance-response coherence using an LLM, we synthetically generate user utterances accompanied by correct and modified failure-containing system responses. We use input-output, chain-of-thought, self-consistency prompting, and multi-agent prompting techniques with 13 reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs of varying sizes and providers, including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, and Meta. We evaluate our approach on a case study involving restaurant recommendations. The most substantial improvements occur for small non-reasoning models when applying advanced prompting techniques, particularly multi-agent prompting. However, reasoning models consistently outperform non-reasoning models, with the best performance achieved using single-agent prompting with self-consistency. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 reaches an F1-score of 0.99 at a cost of 0.002 USD per request. Overall, the best balance between effectiveness and cost-time efficiency is reached with the non-reasoning model DeepSeek-V3. Our findings show that LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable and accurate alternative to traditional human evaluation for benchmarking contextual understanding in ConvQA systems.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, synthetic datasets, diversity optimization, determinantal point processes, training-free method<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of generating diverse synthetic datasets using large language models (LLMs), which are commonly employed for training and evaluating downstream models. Existing synthetic data generation methods often suffer from limited diversity, reducing their effectiveness. To overcome this, the authors propose Voyager, a novel and principled iterative approach that directly optimizes dataset diversity. Voyager leverages the mathematical framework of determinantal point processes to quantitatively enhance diversity in the generated samples. Unlike prior approaches, Voyager is training-free, making it compatible with closed-source LLMs and scalable to large datasets. The paper provides theoretical justification for Voyager’s effectiveness and validates its performance through extensive experiments. Results demonstrate that Voyager significantly boosts dataset diversity, achieving improvements of 1.5 to 3 times over popular baseline methods. This enhancement in diversity can potentially lead to better generalization and robustness in downstream model training and evaluation. Overall, Voyager represents a practical and theoretically sound advancement for synthetic dataset generation using LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate synthetic datasets for the evaluation and training of downstream models. However, prior work has noted that such generated data lacks diversity. In this paper, we propose Voyager, a novel principled approach to generate diverse datasets. Our approach is iterative and directly optimizes a mathematical quantity that optimizes the diversity of the dataset using the machinery of determinantal point processes. Furthermore, our approach is training-free, applicable to closed-source models, and scalable. In addition to providing theoretical justification for the working of our method, we also demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that Voyager significantly outperforms popular baseline approaches by providing a 1.5-3x improvement in diversity.

<div> Keywords: BLASST, sparse attention, long-context inference, FlashAttention, sparsity-aware training  

<br /><br />Summary: The paper introduces BLASST, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to enhance the efficiency of long-context inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically pruning negligible attention scores. Unlike existing methods, BLASST operates without any pre-computation or proxy scoring, utilizing a fixed threshold and information from the ongoing softmax calculation to skip unnecessary computations such as softmax for low-value elements, Value block loading, and matrix multiplication. This approach is fully compatible with current FlashAttention kernel implementations and adds minimal latency, supporting all major attention variants (MHA, GQA, MQA, MLA) during both prefill and decode phases. The authors propose an automated calibration technique that discovers a straightforward inverse relation between the optimal threshold and context length, enabling reliable performance across varying sequence lengths. Empirical results demonstrate BLASST achieves a 1.62× speedup during prefill with 74.7% attention sparsity and a 1.48× speedup during decode at 73.2% sparsity on modern GPUs, all while maintaining high model accuracy. Additionally, the study explores sparsity-aware training, confirming that models can be optimized to handle sparse attention patterns more naturally, thereby pushing the boundaries of the trade-off between accuracy and sparsity further. <div>
arXiv:2512.12087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for long-context inference capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the computational and memory bottlenecks inherent to the standard attention mechanism. To address this challenge, we introduce BLASST, a drop-in sparse attention method that dynamically prunes the attention matrix without any pre-computation or proxy scores. Our method uses a fixed threshold and existing information from online softmax to identify negligible attention scores, skipping softmax computation, Value block loading, and the subsequent matrix multiplication. This fits seamlessly into existing FlashAttention kernel designs with negligible latency overhead. The approach is applicable to both prefill and decode stages across all attention variants (MHA, GQA, MQA, and MLA), providing a unified solution for accelerating long-context inference. We develop an automated calibration procedure that reveals a simple inverse relationship between optimal threshold and context length, enabling robust deployment across diverse scenarios. Maintaining high accuracy, we demonstrate a 1.62x speedup for prefill at 74.7% sparsity and a 1.48x speedup for decode at 73.2% sparsity on modern GPUs. Furthermore, we explore sparsity-aware training as a natural extension, showing that models can be trained to be inherently more robust to sparse attention patterns, pushing the accuracy-sparsity frontier even further.

<title>Extending the Context of Pretrained LLMs by Dropping Their Positional Embeddings</title>

<div> Keywords: positional embeddings, language models, context extension, finetuning, recalibration  

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the limitation of language models (LMs) in handling longer context sequences beyond their pretrained sequence length, a problem historically mitigated by expensive finetuning. The authors introduce DroPE (Dropping the Positional Embeddings), a simple yet effective method that removes positional embeddings after the LM has been pretrained, following a short recalibration phase. They provide three key insights: first, positional embeddings are essential during pretraining as they offer an inductive bias that helps the model converge effectively. Second, the model’s heavy reliance on positional embeddings hinders its ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training, even when existing positional embedding scaling techniques are applied. Third, positional embeddings are not fundamentally necessary for language modeling at inference time and can be discarded post-training without loss of performance. Empirically, DroPE enables seamless zero-shot extension of context length without requiring any long-context finetuning, maintaining the model’s original capabilities. The method was validated across various model architectures and dataset sizes, significantly outperforming prior approaches including specialized architectures and rotary positional embedding scaling strategies. This work offers a practical solution to extend LM context windows efficiently and with minimal additional costs. <div>
arXiv:2512.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So far, expensive finetuning beyond the pretraining sequence length has been a requirement for effectively extending the context of language models (LM). In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context. Our findings hold across different models and dataset sizes, far outperforming previous specialized architectures and established rotary positional embedding scaling methods.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion Language Models, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Inference, Token Selection, MEDAL  

<br /><br />Summary: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models by enabling parallel generation and enhancing global coherence in text generation. However, their inference process involves a challenging combinatorial problem of deciding which positions to unmask and which tokens to commit at each step. Current methods either use heuristics that often lead to suboptimal decoding paths or require additional training to guide token selection. To address these challenges, the paper introduces MEDAL, a novel framework that incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the initialization phase of diffusion model inference. By using MCTS, MEDAL systematically explores viable unmasking trajectories, thus providing a robust and principled starting point for the subsequent denoising steps. This approach restricts the search space to high-confidence actions and prioritizes token choices that enhance the model's certainty over the remaining masked tokens. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MEDAL achieves up to a 22.0% performance improvement over existing inference strategies. This work establishes a new paradigm for search-based inference in diffusion language models, combining principled exploration with efficient token selection to improve generation quality. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive generation, offering parallel generation and improved global coherence. During inference, DLMs generate text by iteratively denoising masked sequences in parallel; however, determining which positions to unmask and which tokens to commit forms a large combinatorial search problem. Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection. To introduce a principled search mechanism for DLMs inference, we introduce MEDAL, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree SEarch initialization for Diffusion LAnguage Model inference. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search at the initialization stage to explore promising unmasking trajectories, providing a robust starting point for subsequent refinement. This integration is enabled by restricting the search space to high-confidence actions and prioritizing token choices that improve model confidence over remaining masked positions. Across multiple benchmarks, MEDAL achieves up to 22.0% improvement over existing inference strategies, establishing a new paradigm for search-based inference in diffusion language models.

<div> Keywords: semantic distance, multi-kernel Gaussian processes, Matérn kernel, fine-grained sentiment classification, in-context learning<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the fundamental problem of measuring semantic distance between text segments, which is crucial for various computational linguistics tasks such as text retrieval and classification. The authors propose a novel semantic distance measure based on multi-kernel Gaussian processes (MK-GP). Specifically, they model the latent semantic function of texts as a Gaussian process, using a covariance function that combines Matérn and polynomial kernel components. Unlike traditional methods with fixed metrics, their approach enables automatic learning of kernel parameters from data under supervision, allowing adaptability to specific data distributions and task requirements. The proposed measure is evaluated within the context of fine-grained sentiment classification, particularly using large language models in an in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that the MK-GP-based semantic distance measure effectively captures subtle distinctions in sentiment, outperforming classical fixed semantic distance methods. This work therefore highlights the advantage of data-driven, flexible kernel learning in enhancing semantic similarity assessments in NLP applications. <div>
arXiv:2512.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic distance measurement is a fundamental problem in computational linguistics, providing a quantitative characterization of similarity or relatedness between text segments, and underpinning tasks such as text retrieval and text classification. From a mathematical perspective, a semantic distance can be viewed as a metric defined on a space of texts or on a representation space derived from them. However, most classical semantic distance methods are essentially fixed, making them difficult to adapt to specific data distributions and task requirements. In this paper, a semantic distance measure based on multi-kernel Gaussian processes (MK-GP) was proposed. The latent semantic function associated with texts was modeled as a Gaussian process, with its covariance function given by a combined kernel combining Mat\'ern and polynomial components. The kernel parameters were learned automatically from data under supervision, rather than being hand-crafted. This semantic distance was instantiated and evaluated in the context of fine-grained sentiment classification with large language models under an in-context learning (ICL) setup. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed measure.

<div> Keywords: sound symbolism, size semantics, cross-linguistic, phonological form, adversarial scrubber  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. This study investigates sound symbolism, the non-arbitrary relationship between word sounds and meanings, specifically focusing on how phonological features correspond to size semantics.  
2. A large and typologically diverse dataset was compiled, consisting of 810 adjectives from 27 languages, with each word phonemically transcribed and verified using native-speaker audio.  
3. Using interpretable classifiers analyzing bag-of-segment features, the researchers found that phonological forms can predict the size meaning of words above chance levels, even across languages that are unrelated. Both vowels and consonants contributed to this predictive ability.  
4. To verify the universality of these sound-symbolic cues beyond language family effects, an adversarial scrubber model was trained to minimize language identity signals while retaining size semantics. This resulted in language identity prediction falling below chance, whereas size prediction remained significantly above chance, confirming the presence of cross-family sound-symbolic bias.  
5. The authors release the dataset, code, and diagnostic tools to encourage future large-scale research into iconicity and sound symbolism across languages, providing a valuable resource for the linguistic and computational research communities. <div>

Abstract: The phenomenon of sound symbolism, the non-arbitrary mapping between word sounds and meanings, has long been demonstrated through anecdotal experiments like Bouba Kiki, but rarely tested at scale. We present the first computational cross-linguistic analysis of sound symbolism in the semantic domain of size. We compile a typologically broad dataset of 810 adjectives (27 languages, 30 words each), each phonemically transcribed and validated with native-speaker audio. Using interpretable classifiers over bag-of-segment features, we find that phonological form predicts size semantics above chance even across unrelated languages, with both vowels and consonants contributing. To probe universality beyond genealogy, we train an adversarial scrubber that suppresses language identity while preserving size signal (also at family granularity). Language prediction averaged across languages and settings falls below chance while size prediction remains significantly above chance, indicating cross-family sound-symbolic bias. We release data, code, and diagnostic tools for future large-scale studies of iconicity.

<div> Keywords: MARKET-BENCH, large language models, quantitative trading, backtesting, strategy evaluation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper introduces MARKET-BENCH, a new benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on fundamental quantitative trading tasks by requiring them to generate executable backtesting code from natural language strategy descriptions and market assumptions. <br />2. MARKET-BENCH covers three canonical trading strategies: scheduled trading on Microsoft (MSFT), pairs trading on Coca-Cola (KO) and Pepsi (PEP), and delta hedging on MSFT, with models tasked to produce code that matches a reference implementation’s profitability, drawdown, and position metrics. <br />3. Twelve state-of-the-art LLMs are assessed using a multi-round pass@k evaluation that distinguishes between structural reliability (whether the backtest code runs) and numerical accuracy (mean absolute error in backtest metrics). <br />4. Results show that most models perform reliably on the simplest strategy (average pass@3 score of 0.80), but accuracy and robustness vary widely by model and task, with Gemini 3 Pro and Claude 4.5 Sonnet excelling in reliability and error on simpler tasks. GPT-5.1 Codex-Max achieves perfect pass@1 on the first two strategies and the lowest error on the easiest task, while Qwen3 Max attains perfect pass@3 but sometimes yields inaccurate P&amp;L paths. <br />5. The findings reveal that current LLMs can lay foundational trading infrastructure but remain challenged in robustly reasoning about critical trading elements such as prices, inventory, and risk, motivating ongoing work and the public release of MARKET-BENCH alongside a leaderboard at https://marketbench.ai. <div>

Abstract: We introduce MARKET-BENCH, a benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on introductory quantitative trading tasks by asking them to construct executable backtesters from natural-language strategy descriptions and market assumptions. Each instance specifies one of three canonical strategies -- scheduled trading on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), pairs trading on Coca-Cola (NASDAQ: KO) and Pepsi (NASDAQ: PEP), or delta hedging on MSFT -- and models must produce code whose P\&amp;L, drawdown, and position paths match a verifiable reference implementation. We assess twelve state-of-the-art models using a multi-round pass@k metric that separates structural reliability (whether the backtest runs) from numerical accuracy (mean absolute error of the backtest metrics). While most models reliably execute the simplest strategy (average pass@3 of 0.80), errors vary by orders of magnitude across models and tasks: Gemini 3 Pro and Claude 4.5 Sonnet combine strong reliability with low error on simpler strategies, GPT-5.1 Codex-Max achieves perfect pass@1 on the first two strategies and the lowest best-run error on the easiest task, and Qwen3 Max attains perfect pass@3 yet sometimes produces inaccurate P\&amp;L paths. These results show that current LLMs can scaffold basic trading infrastructure but still struggle to reason robustly about prices, inventory, and risk; we release MARKET-BENCH and a public leaderboard at https://marketbench.ai.

<title>F5-TTS-RO: Extending F5-TTS to Romanian TTS via Lightweight Input Adaptation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12297</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12297</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: F5-TTS, Romanian language, input-level adapter, voice cloning, code-switching  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This work presents a lightweight input-level adapter integrated into the F5-TTS model specifically to support the Romanian language. To retain the model’s original functionalities such as voice cloning and support for English and Chinese, the original weights are kept frozen while a new sub-network is appended and trained as an extension of the text encoder’s textual embedding matrix. The adapter uses a ConvNeXt module, already implemented in F5-TTS, to model co-dependencies among new character-level embeddings. This module functions as a “soft” letter-to-sound converter, transforming Romanian text into continuous representations that the F5-TTS system uses to generate natural-sounding Romanian speech. The model’s performance was evaluated with 20 human listeners over three tasks: assessing audio similarity between reference and synthesized speech, evaluating pronunciation and naturalness, and testing Romanian-English code-switching ability. Results show that voice cloning capabilities are preserved and that the model supports code-switching to some extent, though traces of an English accent remain in Romanian speech output. The authors have open-sourced their code and provided example audio samples for public access at their GitHub repository: https://github.com/racai-ro/Ro-F5TTS. <div>

Abstract: This work introduces a lightweight input-level adapter for the F5-TTS model that enables Romanian Language support. To preserve the existing capabilities of the model (voice cloning, English and Chinese support), we keep the original weights frozen, append a sub-network to the model and train it as an extension for the textual embedding matrix of the text encoder. For simplicity, we rely on ConvNeXt module implemented in F5-TTS to also model the co-dependencies between the new character-level embeddings. The module serves as a ``soft`` letter-to-sound layer, converting Romanian text into a continuous representation that the F5-TTS model uses to produce naturally sounding Romanian utterances. We evaluate the model with a pool of 20 human listeners across three tasks: (a) audio similarity between reference and generated speech, (b) pronunciation and naturalness and (c) Romanian-English code-switching. The results indicate that our approach maintains voice cloning capabilities and enables, to a certain extent, code-switching within the same utterance; however, residual English accent characteristics remain. We open-source our code and provide example audio samples at https://github.com/racai-ro/Ro-F5TTS.

<title>SCIR: A Self-Correcting Iterative Refinement Framework for Enhanced Information Extraction Based on Schema</title>

<div> Large Language Models, Information Extraction, Self-Correcting Iterative Refinement, Multi-task Bilingual Dataset, Training Efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article introduces the Self-Correcting Iterative Refinement (SCIR) framework, a novel universal paradigm designed to improve information extraction (IE) systems powered by large language models (LLMs). The SCIR framework addresses two main challenges in current fine-tuning approaches: high training costs and difficulties in aligning model outputs with LLM preferences. The proposed SCIR achieves plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs and IE systems by incorporating a Dual-Path Self-Correcting module and a feedback-driven optimization process, which significantly reduces training expenses by 87% compared to traditional methods. To further enhance preference alignment, the authors present the Multi-task Bilingual (Chinese-English) Self-Correcting (MBSC) dataset containing over 100,000 entries. This dataset indirectly distills GPT-4’s capabilities into IE result detection models, enabling improved alignment without excessive computational resources. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SCIR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IE methods in three crucial tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction, achieving a 5.27% average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 scores. These advancements collectively contribute to more flexible, lightweight, and efficient IE systems, paving the way for broader adoption of high-performing, cost-effective extraction paradigms. <div>

Abstract: Although Large language Model (LLM)-powered information extraction (IE) systems have shown impressive capabilities, current fine-tuning paradigms face two major limitations: high training costs and difficulties in aligning with LLM preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel universal IE paradigm, the Self-Correcting Iterative Refinement (SCIR) framework, along with a Multi-task Bilingual (Chinese-English) Self-Correcting (MBSC) dataset containing over 100,000 entries. The SCIR framework achieves plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs and IE systems through its Dual-Path Self-Correcting module and feedback-driven optimization, thereby significantly reducing training costs. Concurrently, the MBSC dataset tackles the challenge of preference alignment by indirectly distilling GPT-4's capabilities into IE result detection models. Experimental results demonstrate that SCIR outperforms state-of-the-art IE methods across three key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction, achieving a 5.27 percent average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 while reducing training costs by 87 percent compared to baseline approaches. These advancements not only enhance the flexibility and accuracy of IE systems but also pave the way for lightweight and efficient IE paradigms.

<title>Can GPT replace human raters? Validity and reliability of machine-generated norms for metaphors</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12444</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12444</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, metaphors, GPT, psycholinguistics, reliability<br /><br />Summary:  
This study evaluates the validity and reliability of metaphor ratings generated by three GPT models across 687 items from Italian and English sources. It examines ratings on familiarity, comprehensibility, and imageability, comparing machine outputs with human data. The findings show positive correlations between GPT-generated and human ratings, with familiarity achieving moderate-to-strong alignment in both languages, though correlations decline for metaphors with high sensorimotor complexity. Imageability ratings were moderately correlated in English and moderate-to-strong in Italian, while comprehensibility for English metaphors displayed the strongest correlations. Larger GPT models consistently outperformed smaller ones. GPT ratings effectively predicted behavioral response times and EEG amplitudes, performing comparably to human ratings. Ratings remained highly stable across independent GPT sessions, supporting reproducibility. Despite these strengths, GPT models showed limitations in aligning with humans when evaluating the conventionality and multimodal characteristics of metaphors, suggesting caution when interpreting these dimensions. The study concludes that GPT, particularly larger models, can validly and reliably substitute or supplement human subjects in rating metaphorical properties, while highlighting areas needing further refinement related to the complexity of metaphorical meaning. <div>
arXiv:2512.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in scientific research, the issue of their trustworthiness becomes crucial. In psycholinguistics, LLMs have been recently employed in automatically augmenting human-rated datasets, with promising results obtained by generating ratings for single words. Yet, performance for ratings of complex items, i.e., metaphors, is still unexplored. Here, we present the first assessment of the validity and reliability of ratings of metaphors on familiarity, comprehensibility, and imageability, generated by three GPT models for a total of 687 items gathered from the Italian Figurative Archive and three English studies. We performed a thorough validation in terms of both alignment with human data and ability to predict behavioral and electrophysiological responses. We found that machine-generated ratings positively correlated with human-generated ones. Familiarity ratings reached moderate-to-strong correlations for both English and Italian metaphors, although correlations weakened for metaphors with high sensorimotor load. Imageability showed moderate correlations in English and moderate-to-strong in Italian. Comprehensibility for English metaphors exhibited the strongest correlations. Overall, larger models outperformed smaller ones and greater human-model misalignment emerged with familiarity and imageability. Machine-generated ratings significantly predicted response times and the EEG amplitude, with a strength comparable to human ratings. Moreover, GPT ratings obtained across independent sessions were highly stable. We conclude that GPT, especially larger models, can validly and reliably replace - or augment - human subjects in rating metaphor properties. Yet, LLMs align worse with humans when dealing with conventionality and multimodal aspects of metaphorical meaning, calling for careful consideration of the nature of stimuli.

<div> Keywords: large language models, language knowledge, evaluation, post-Turing test, language science<br /><br />Summary: This article emphasizes the recognition that large language models (LLMs) have effectively learned to use language, which can pave the way for significant advancements in the field of language science. The authors argue that making progress in understanding language through these models might necessitate abandoning several traditional approaches to evaluating language knowledge, as these conventional methods may no longer be sufficient or appropriate. Additionally, the paper suggests that the landscape of language assessment is fundamentally changing, marking the arrival of a post-Turing test era where the focus moves beyond simply distinguishing human from machine language use. This shift challenges researchers to develop new frameworks and criteria for measuring language understanding and capability in LLMs, acknowledging their sophisticated performance. Ultimately, the work calls for a paradigm shift in language science, one that embraces the capabilities of LLMs and encourages innovative evaluation techniques to unlock deeper insights about language itself. <div>

Abstract: Acknowledging that large language models have learned to use language can open doors to breakthrough language science. Achieving these breakthroughs may require abandoning some long-held ideas about how language knowledge is evaluated and reckoning with the difficult fact that we have entered a post-Turing test era.

<div> Culture, Large Language Models, Cultural Alignment, Cultural Prompting, Hofstede's Dimensions<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Culture fundamentally shapes human interactions and influences how individuals perceive and respond to everyday situations. Understanding cultural alignment is critical as Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into human-computer interaction.<br /><br />2. This study evaluates the cultural alignment of eight popular LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3 variants, GPT-4 and GPT-5 series, Claude Opus 4, Llama 3.1, and Mistral Large, using the VSM13 International Survey and Hofstede's cultural dimensions as benchmarks.<br /><br />3. The research investigates the models' baseline cultural preferences, revealing a predominant alignment with United States cultural norms when no specific culture is prompted.<br /><br />4. The study introduces cultural prompting—adjusting system prompts to orient an LLM’s responses toward the cultural characteristics of specific countries (China, France, India, Iran, Japan, and the United States)—to test model adaptability.<br /><br />5. Results show that seven out of eight models successfully shifted their responses closer to the targeted culture via prompting, though difficulties remain in aligning with Japanese and Chinese cultural traits, even among models developed by the Chinese company DeepSeek.<br /><br />This work highlights both the promise and challenges of culturally adaptive LLMs in global applications, emphasizing the need for improved cultural sensitivity in AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Culture is the bedrock of human interaction; it dictates how we perceive and respond to everyday interactions. As the field of human-computer interaction grows via the rise of generative Large Language Models (LLMs), the cultural alignment of these models become an important field of study. This work, using the VSM13 International Survey and Hofstede's cultural dimensions, identifies the cultural alignment of popular LLMs (DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4, Claude Opus 4, Llama 3.1, and Mistral Large). We then use cultural prompting, or using system prompts to shift the cultural alignment of a model to a desired country, to test the adaptability of these models to other cultures, namely China, France, India, Iran, Japan, and the United States. We find that the majority of the eight LLMs tested favor the United States when the culture is not specified, with varying results when prompted for other cultures. When using cultural prompting, seven of the eight models shifted closer to the expected culture. We find that models had trouble aligning with Japan and China, despite two of the models tested originating with the Chinese company DeepSeek.

<div> Keywords: Nagamese, NagaNLP, synthetic data generation, XLM-RoBERTa, low-resource languages<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the lack of NLP resources for Nagamese, a creole language severely underrepresented in digital technology. It introduces NagaNLP, an open-source toolkit for Nagamese developed using a novel synthetic-hybrid data generation pipeline. The methodology involves an expert-guided large language model (Gemini) to generate initial synthetic data, which is then refined and annotated by native speakers, resulting in a 10,000-pair conversational dataset and a high-quality annotated corpus for fundamental NLP tasks. To validate the approach, discriminative and generative models were trained and evaluated. A fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-base model achieved state-of-the-art results with 93.81% accuracy and 0.90 F1-Macro on Part-of-Speech tagging, and 0.75 F1-Macro on Named Entity Recognition, significantly outperforming zero-shot baselines. Additionally, a fine-tuned Llama-3.2-3B Instruct model, named NagaLLaMA, demonstrated cutting-edge conversational performance with a perplexity of 3.85, far outperforming few-shot models by an order of magnitude. The authors release the complete NagaNLP toolkit—including datasets, models, and code—establishing a foundational resource for Nagamese and providing a replicable framework to combat data scarcity in other low-resource language contexts. <div>

Abstract: The vast majority of the world's languages, particularly creoles like Nagamese, remain severely under-resourced in Natural Language Processing (NLP), creating a significant barrier to their representation in digital technology. This paper introduces NagaNLP, a comprehensive open-source toolkit for Nagamese, bootstrapped through a novel methodology that relies on LLM-driven but human-validated synthetic data generation. We detail a multi-stage pipeline where an expert-guided LLM (Gemini) generates a candidate corpus, which is then refined and annotated by native speakers. This synthetic-hybrid approach yielded a 10K pair conversational dataset and a high-quality annotated corpus for foundational tasks. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we trained both discriminative and generative models. Our fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-base model establishes a new benchmark for Nagamese, achieving a 93.81\% accuracy (0.90 F1-Macro) on Part-of-Speech tagging and a 0.75 F1-Macro on Named Entity Recognition, massively outperforming strong zero-shot baselines. Furthermore, we fine-tuned a Llama-3.2-3B Instruct model, named NagaLLaMA, which demonstrates superior performance on conversational tasks, achieving a Perplexity of 3.85, an order of magnitude improvement over its few-shot counterpart (96.76). We release the NagaNLP toolkit, including all datasets, models, and code, providing a foundational resource for a previously underserved language and a reproducible framework for reducing data scarcity in other low-resource contexts.

<div> Keywords: instruction-based editing, large language models, hypernetwork, difference-aware regularization, text editing

<br /><br />Summary: Instruction-based text editing is a vital task for applications like code editors but remains challenging for large language models (LLMs), which often fail to precisely follow user instructions and preserve unchanged content. Unlike free-form text generation, editing demands faithful implementation of user edits without introducing unintended modifications, as even small errors can disrupt functionality. Existing methods treat editing as generic generation, leading to failures such as poor alignment with user intent and over-editing of unaffected text regions. To overcome these issues, the paper proposes HyperEdit, which incorporates two main innovations. First, it uses hypernetwork-based dynamic adaptation to create request-specific parameters, allowing the model to customize its editing approach according to each individual instruction. Second, it introduces difference-aware regularization that concentrates supervision on the altered parts of the text, effectively reducing over-editing while ensuring precise and minimal changes. These strategies enable HyperEdit to significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 9% to 30% relative improvements in BLEU scores on modified text regions, despite using a relatively small model with only 3 billion parameters. This work advances reliable and accurate instruction-based editing in language models, which is crucial for practical text and code editing tasks. <div>

Abstract: Instruction-based text editing is increasingly critical for real-world applications such as code editors (e.g., Cursor), but Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to struggle with this task. Unlike free-form generation, editing requires faithfully implementing user instructions while preserving unchanged content, as even minor unintended modifications can break functionality. Existing approaches treat editing as generic text generation, leading to two key failures: they struggle to faithfully align edits with diverse user intents, and they often over-edit unchanged regions. We propose HyperEdit to address both issues. First, we introduce hypernetwork-based dynamic adaptation that generates request-specific parameters, enabling the model to tailor its editing strategy to each instruction. Second, we develop difference-aware regularization that focuses supervision on modified spans, preventing over-editing while ensuring precise, minimal changes. HyperEdit achieves a 9%--30% relative improvement in BLEU on modified regions over state-of-the-art baselines, despite utilizing only 3B parameters.

<title>Coupled Variational Reinforcement Learning for Language Model General Reasoning</title>

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, verifier-free, variational inference, reasoning coherence, language models<br /><br />Summary:<br /> This paper addresses limitations in current verifier-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods for language model reasoning, which typically rely on sampling reasoning traces conditioned only on the question, causing inefficient exploration and poor coherence between reasoning steps and final answers. To overcome this, the authors propose CoVRL (Coupled Variational Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that couples prior and posterior distributions via a hybrid sampling strategy. CoVRL constructs and optimizes a composite distribution integrating both distributions, unifying variational inference with reinforcement learning techniques. This coupling allows for more efficient exploration of reasoning paths while maintaining strong coherence between the generated thought process and final answers. Extensive experiments conducted on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CoVRL significantly improves performance, achieving a 12.4% increase over the base model and an additional 2.3% improvement compared to existing strong verifier-free RL baselines. These results indicate that CoVRL provides a principled framework to boost the general reasoning capabilities of large language models without relying on verifiable reward signals. This work thus advances the development of more effective and coherent reasoning methodologies in language model training. <div>
arXiv:2512.12576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning have achieved impressive progress in language model reasoning, they are constrained by the requirement for verifiable rewards. Recent verifier-free RL methods address this limitation by utilizing the intrinsic probabilities of LLMs generating reference answers as reward signals. However, these approaches typically sample reasoning traces conditioned only on the question. This design decouples reasoning-trace sampling from answer information, leading to inefficient exploration and incoherence between traces and final answers. In this paper, we propose \textit{\b{Co}upled \b{V}ariational \b{R}einforcement \b{L}earning} (CoVRL), which bridges variational inference and reinforcement learning by coupling prior and posterior distributions through a hybrid sampling strategy. By constructing and optimizing a composite distribution that integrates these two distributions, CoVRL enables efficient exploration while preserving strong thought-answer coherence. Extensive experiments on mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that CoVRL improves performance by 12.4\% over the base model and achieves an additional 2.3\% improvement over strong state-of-the-art verifier-free RL baselines, providing a principled framework for enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of language models.

<div> Large Language Models, Rare scenarios, Symbolic memory, Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery, Method diversity  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling rare, low-resource, or previously unseen scenarios, such as niche hardware issues or unusual IoT device behaviors, due to sparse training data representation. It highlights that LLMs depend mainly on implicit parametric memory, which restricts their capacity for explicit acquisition, recall, and refinement of problem-solving methods, resulting in intuition-driven rather than deliberate learning. Inspired by human learning from rare experiences, the authors propose a novel framework combining two key mechanisms: "Obvious Record," which explicitly stores cause-result or question-solution relationships as symbolic memory to enable persistent learning from infrequent encounters, and "Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery," which prioritizes methods with high semantic dissimilarity to capture diverse, underrepresented strategies often missed by typical next-token prediction. The approach was verified on a benchmark of 60 semantically diverse question-solution pairs, demonstrating that the entropy-guided method achieves enhanced coverage of unseen questions and significantly greater internal method diversity compared to a random baseline. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in discovering more generalizable, human-inspired problem-solving methods for LLMs, especially in rare or novel situations. <div>
arXiv:2512.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at extracting common patterns from large-scale corpora, yet they struggle with rare, low-resource, or previously unseen scenarios-such as niche hardware deployment issues or irregular IoT device behaviors-because such cases are sparsely represented in training data. Moreover, LLMs rely primarily on implicit parametric memory, which limits their ability to explicitly acquire, recall, and refine methods, causing them to behave predominantly as intuition-driven predictors rather than deliberate, method-oriented learners. Inspired by how humans learn from rare experiences, this paper proposes a human-inspired learning framework that integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Obvious Record, explicitly stores cause--result (or question--solution) relationships as symbolic memory, enabling persistent learning even from single or infrequent encounters. The second, Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery, prioritizes and preserves methods with high semantic dissimilarity, allowing the system to capture diverse and underrepresented strategies that are typically overlooked by next-token prediction. Verification on a benchmark of 60 semantically diverse question--solution pairs demonstrates that the proposed entropy-guided approach achieves stronger coverage of unseen questions and significantly greater internal diversity than a random baseline, confirming its effectiveness in discovering more generalizable and human-inspired methods.

<div> Sparse Knowledge Graphs, Sparse KG Reasoning, Path-based Methods, Structural Information, Probabilistic Aggregation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Sparse Knowledge Graphs (KGs) often suffer from incomplete or limited data, posing significant challenges for KG reasoning tasks aimed at inferring missing knowledge. Among the approaches to sparse KG reasoning, path-based methods are popular due to their interpretability, but they commonly rely on computationally expensive random walk techniques that generate paths of uneven quality. Moreover, these methods treat paths independently, overlooking the structured nature of graphs. To overcome these limitations, the paper introduces StruProKGR, a novel Structural and Probabilistic framework designed for efficient and interpretable reasoning on sparse KGs. StruProKGR features a distance-guided path collection mechanism that drastically reduces computational cost by focusing on more relevant paths. It also incorporates structural information through probabilistic path aggregation, which emphasizes paths that mutually reinforce each other, improving reasoning quality. Extensive experiments conducted on five sparse KG reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that StruProKGR consistently outperforms existing path-based models in both effectiveness and efficiency. Overall, StruProKGR offers an effective, efficient, and more interpretable solution for reasoning over sparse knowledge graphs, addressing key challenges in current methodologies. <div>

Abstract: Sparse Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are commonly encountered in real-world applications, where knowledge is often incomplete or limited. Sparse KG reasoning, the task of inferring missing knowledge over sparse KGs, is inherently challenging due to the scarcity of knowledge and the difficulty of capturing relational patterns in sparse scenarios. Among all sparse KG reasoning methods, path-based ones have attracted plenty of attention due to their interpretability. Existing path-based methods typically rely on computationally intensive random walks to collect paths, producing paths of variable quality. Additionally, these methods fail to leverage the structured nature of graphs by treating paths independently. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Structural and Probabilistic framework named StruProKGR, tailored for efficient and interpretable reasoning on sparse KGs. StruProKGR utilizes a distance-guided path collection mechanism to significantly reduce computational costs while exploring more relevant paths. It further enhances the reasoning process by incorporating structural information through probabilistic path aggregation, which prioritizes paths that reinforce each other. Extensive experiments on five sparse KG reasoning benchmarks reveal that StruProKGR surpasses existing path-based methods in both effectiveness and efficiency, providing an effective, efficient, and interpretable solution for sparse KG reasoning.

<div> Keywords: syllogistic reasoning, large language models, symbolic inference, natural language understanding, formal reasoning<br /><br />Summary: This study investigates the syllogistic reasoning abilities of 14 large language models (LLMs) through both logical symbolic inference and natural language perspectives. The research aims to understand the fundamental reasoning capabilities inherent in these models and the developments shaping their evolution. Findings indicate that syllogistic reasoning is not consistently an emergent property across all examined LLMs, with varied performance levels observed. However, some models demonstrate perfect symbolic reasoning accuracy, which raises questions about the nature of their reasoning processes. The results suggest that certain LLMs may be evolving into formal reasoning mechanisms, emphasizing logical precision rather than encapsulating the subtlety and nuance characteristic of human reasoning. Overall, the work highlights both the promise and limitations of current LLMs in simulating different facets of human-like reasoning within natural language contexts. This inquiry contributes to the broader dialogue on advancing AI's reasoning abilities and understanding how LLMs handle complex inferential tasks spanning formal logic and natural language comprehension. <div>

Abstract: We study syllogistic reasoning in LLMs from the logical and natural language perspectives. In process, we explore fundamental reasoning capabilities of the LLMs and the direction this research is moving forward. To aid in our studies, we use 14 large language models and investigate their syllogistic reasoning capabilities in terms of symbolic inferences as well as natural language understanding. Even though this reasoning mechanism is not a uniform emergent property across LLMs, the perfect symbolic performances in certain models make us wonder whether LLMs are becoming more and more formal reasoning mechanisms, rather than making explicit the nuances of human reasoning.

<div> Unigram tokenization, Byte-Pair Encoding, SentencePiece, probabilistic model, compression optimization  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This article discusses the Unigram tokenization algorithm, which presents a probabilistic approach to tokenization as opposed to the commonly used greedy heuristics found in Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE). The authors highlight the theoretical benefits of the Unigram model but note that its practical implementation tends to be complex, resulting in limited adoption mainly through the SentencePiece package and its derivatives. To address this, the paper offers a detailed and clear guide on how to implement Unigram tokenization effectively, along with advice on selecting appropriate parameters to optimize performance. Additionally, the authors propose a simpler variant of the algorithm that intentionally accepts a slightly higher training loss. This trade-off leads to the advantage of better compression rates, making it a practical option when implementation simplicity and compression efficiency are preferred over minimal training loss. The work thus bridges the gap between the theoretical appeal of Unigram tokenization and its practical deployment, potentially enabling wider use in natural language processing tasks and improving tokenization strategy choices in real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: The Unigram tokenization algorithm offers a probabilistic alternative to the greedy heuristics of Byte-Pair Encoding. Despite its theoretical elegance, its implementation in practice is complex, limiting its adoption to the SentencePiece package and adapters thereof. We bridge this gap between theory and practice by providing a clear guide to implementation and parameter choices. We also identify a simpler algorithm that accepts slightly higher training loss in exchange for improved compression.

<div> Keywords: legal relations, Chinese civil law, legal AI, relation extraction, large language models<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the underexplored area of legal relations within Chinese civil law cases in the legal artificial intelligence (legal AI) domain. The authors introduce a comprehensive schema featuring a hierarchical taxonomy and clear definitions of arguments designed for AI systems to effectively capture legal relations in these cases. Based on this schema, they define a novel legal relation extraction task. To support this task, the work presents LexRel, an expert-annotated benchmark dataset specifically created for legal relation extraction in Chinese civil law. Using LexRel, the study evaluates state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) for their ability to extract legal relations, revealing significant limitations of current LLMs in accurately identifying civil legal relations. Finally, the paper demonstrates that incorporating identified legal relations as additional information can consistently improve the performance of other downstream legal AI tasks, highlighting the practical benefits of the proposed approach in judicial AI applications. <div>

Abstract: Legal relations form a highly consequential analytical framework of civil law system, serving as a crucial foundation for resolving disputes and realizing values of the rule of law in judicial practice. However, legal relations in Chinese civil cases remain underexplored in the field of legal artificial intelligence (legal AI), largely due to the absence of comprehensive schemas. In this work, we firstly introduce a comprehensive schema, which contains a hierarchical taxonomy and definitions of arguments, for AI systems to capture legal relations in Chinese civil cases. Based on this schema, we then formulate legal relation extraction task and present LexRel, an expert-annotated benchmark for legal relation extraction in Chinese civil law. We use LexRel to evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on legal relation extractions, showing that current LLMs exhibit significant limitations in accurately identifying civil legal relations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating legal relations information leads to consistent performance gains on other downstream legal AI tasks.

<div> Authorship analysis, Urdu novels, character interaction networks, graph neural networks, narrative structure<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the gap in authorship analysis by focusing on high-level narrative structures rather than just lexical and stylistic cues, particularly for Urdu literature, a low-resource language. The authors propose representing Urdu novels as character interaction networks, where nodes are characters and edges indicate co-occurrences within close narrative proximity. They explore several graph-based methods including global structural features, node-level semantic summaries, unsupervised graph embeddings, and supervised graph neural networks to capture authorial style from narrative structure. The study uses a dataset of 52 Urdu novels authored by seven different writers. Through systematic experiments and a strict author-aware evaluation protocol, the learned graph representations notably outperform both hand-crafted and unsupervised graph baselines. The best-performing model achieves an accuracy of up to 0.857, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph neural networks in extracting stylistically informative features based on narrative interactions. This approach not only advances computational analysis of narrative structures but also provides a useful methodology for authorship attribution in low-resource languages like Urdu, highlighting the potential of graph-based methods in literary and linguistic research. <div>

Abstract: Authorship analysis has traditionally focused on lexical and stylistic cues within text, while higher-level narrative structure remains underexplored, particularly for low-resource languages such as Urdu. This work proposes a graph-based framework that models Urdu novels as character interaction networks to examine whether authorial style can be inferred from narrative structure alone. Each novel is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to characters and edges denote their co-occurrence within narrative proximity. We systematically compare multiple graph representations, including global structural features, node-level semantic summaries, unsupervised graph embeddings, and supervised graph neural networks. Experiments on a dataset of 52 Urdu novels written by seven authors show that learned graph representations substantially outperform hand-crafted and unsupervised baselines, achieving up to 0.857 accuracy under a strict author-aware evaluation protocol.

<div> Keywords: decoder-only LLM, fine-tuning, classification head, instruction-tuning, parameter-efficient training<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates two main strategies to fine-tune decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) for text classification when computational resources are limited. First, it explores attaching a classification head to a pre-trained causal LLM and fine-tuning it by using the model's final token embedding as a sequence representation. Second, it examines instruction-tuning the LLM in a prompt-response format tailored for classification tasks. To facilitate fine-tuning models up to 8 billion parameters on a single GPU, the authors combine 4-bit model quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to achieve parameter-efficient training. Experiments are conducted on two datasets: a proprietary single-label classification dataset and the public WIPO-Alpha dataset, which is an extreme multi-label classification benchmark. Results demonstrate that the embedding-based classification head significantly outperforms the instruction-tuning approach in terms of F1-score. Moreover, the embedding-based method competes with or even surpasses domain-specific fine-tuned models such as BERT on these tasks. The study highlights the benefits of utilizing the internal representations of causal LLMs alongside efficient fine-tuning techniques, achieving strong classification performance within limited computational budgets. The paper concludes with practical recommendations and suggests future research directions for optimizing LLM fine-tuning in classification scenarios. <div>

Abstract: We explore efficient strategies to fine-tune decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream text classification under resource constraints. Two approaches are investigated: (1) attaching a classification head to a pre-trained causal LLM and fine-tuning on the task (using the LLM's final token embedding as a sequence representation), and (2) instruction-tuning the LLM in a prompt->response format for classification. To enable single-GPU fine-tuning of models up to 8B parameters, we combine 4-bit model quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient training. Experiments on two datasets - a proprietary single-label dataset and the public WIPO-Alpha patent dataset (extreme multi-label classification) - show that the embedding-based method significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned method in F1-score, and is very competitive with - even surpassing - fine-tuned domain-specific models (e.g. BERT) on the same tasks. These results demonstrate that directly leveraging the internal representations of causal LLMs, along with efficient fine-tuning techniques, yields impressive classification performance under limited computational resources. We discuss the advantages of each approach while outlining practical guidelines and future directions for optimizing LLM fine-tuning in classification scenarios.

<title>CoDA: A Context-Decoupled Hierarchical Agent with Reinforcement Learning</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, reinforcement learning, context explosion, hierarchical agent, multi-hop question answering<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the problem of "Context Explosion" in Large Language Model (LLM) agents trained with reinforcement learning, where long text outputs overwhelm the model's context window and degrade reasoning performance. To solve this, the authors propose CoDA, a Context-Decoupled hierarchical Agent that separates high-level planning from low-level execution using a single shared LLM backbone. CoDA operates in two distinct roles: a Planner that decomposes complex tasks in a concise strategic context, and an Executor that manages tool interactions in an isolated, ephemeral workspace. The model is trained end-to-end with PECO (Planner-Executor Co-Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that applies trajectory-level rewards to jointly optimize both roles and encourage smooth cooperation via context-dependent policy updates. Experimental results demonstrate CoDA's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on complex multi-hop question-answering tasks. Furthermore, CoDA exhibits strong robustness in scenarios involving long contexts, maintaining stable performance while other models suffer major declines. This validates the hierarchical design as an effective approach to mitigating context overload and improving reasoning capabilities of RL-trained LLM agents on multi-step tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents trained with reinforcement learning (RL) show great promise for solving complex, multi-step tasks. However, their performance is often crippled by "Context Explosion", where the accumulation of long text outputs overwhelms the model's context window and leads to reasoning failures. To address this, we introduce CoDA, a Context-Decoupled hierarchical Agent, a simple but effective reinforcement learning framework that decouples high-level planning from low-level execution. It employs a single, shared LLM backbone that learns to operate in two distinct, contextually isolated roles: a high-level Planner that decomposes tasks within a concise strategic context, and a low-level Executor that handles tool interactions in an ephemeral, isolated workspace. We train this unified agent end-to-end using PECO (Planner-Executor Co-Optimization), a reinforcement learning methodology that applies a trajectory-level reward to jointly optimize both roles, fostering seamless collaboration through context-dependent policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, and it exhibits strong robustness in long-context scenarios, maintaining stable performance while all other baselines suffer severe degradation, thus further validating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design in mitigating context overload.

<div> Keywords: long-horizon repository generation, autonomous coding agents, NL2Repo Bench, multi-module Python library, sustained agentic competence<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper identifies a critical gap in current benchmarks for coding agents, which mostly test short-term coding tasks and fail to assess the ability to develop complete software systems over extended periods. 2. To address this, the authors introduce NL2Repo Bench, a new benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation capabilities of coding agents starting from only a natural language specification and an empty workspace. 3. Agents tested on this benchmark must autonomously plan software architecture, manage dependencies, write multi-module logic, and deliver a fully installable Python library, accurately simulating real-world software development challenges. 4. Experimental results show that even top-performing open- and closed-source models struggle with the task, achieving less than 40% average test pass rates and rarely producing fully correct repositories. 5. The study highlights fundamental failure modes like premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and insufficient long-term planning, establishing NL2Repo Bench as a rigorous testbed emphasizing the need to overcome long-horizon reasoning challenges in future autonomous coding agents. <div>
arXiv:2512.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in coding agents suggest rapid progress toward autonomous software development, yet existing benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon capabilities required to build complete software systems. Most prior evaluations focus on localized code generation, scaffolded completion, or short-term repair tasks, leaving open the question of whether agents can sustain coherent reasoning, planning, and execution over the extended horizons demanded by real-world repository construction. To address this gap, we present NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation ability of coding agents. Given only a single natural-language requirements document and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implement multi-module logic, and produce a fully installable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal that long-horizon repository generation remains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% average test pass rates and rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps. NL2Repo Bench establishes a rigorous, verifiable testbed for measuring sustained agentic competence and highlights long-horizon reasoning as a central bottleneck for the next generation of autonomous coding agents.

<div> Keywords: continued pretraining, language model adaptation, Portuguese corpus, data quality, Curió-Edu 7B  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper explores the impact of continued pretraining on enhancing language models by exposing them to additional domain-specific or linguistic data, providing an efficient alternative to full retraining. The authors present Curió 7B, a 7-billion-parameter model based on LLaMA-2, trained on 100 billion Portuguese tokens from the ClassiCC-PT corpus, representing the largest Portuguese-specific pretraining effort at this scale to date. The study investigates whether sheer data quantity or data quality plays a more critical role in effective linguistic adaptation. To test this, they introduce Curió-Edu 7B, a variant pretrained solely on an educational and STEM-filtered subset containing just 10 billion tokens—only 10% of the full dataset and requiring 20% of the computational resources. Remarkably, Curió-Edu 7B outperforms the model trained on the entire corpus, highlighting the importance of careful data selection in model adaptation, especially when prior exposure to the target language is limited. Both models have been publicly released via the Hugging Face platform, facilitating further research and application in Portuguese-language NLP tasks. <div>

Abstract: Continued pretraining extends a language model's capabilities by further exposing it to additional data, often tailored to a specific linguistic or domain context. This strategy has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining when adapting general-purpose models to new settings. In this work, we investigate this paradigm through Curi\'o 7B, a 7-billion-parameter model derived from LLaMA-2 and trained on 100 billion Portuguese tokens from the ClassiCC-PT corpus - the most extensive Portuguese-specific continued-pretraining effort above the three-billion-parameter scale to date. Beyond scale, we investigate whether quantity alone suffices or whether data quality plays a decisive role in linguistic adaptation. To this end, we introduce Curi\'o-Edu 7B, a variant trained exclusively on the educational and STEM-filtered subset of the same corpus, totaling just 10 billion tokens. Despite using only 10% of the data and 20% of the computation, Curi\'o-Edu 7B surpasses the full-corpus model in our evaluations, demonstrating that data selection can be fundamental even when adapting models with limited prior exposure to the target language. The developed models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/ClassiCC-Corpus/curio-edu

<div> Keywords: persona-assigned LLMs, long dialogues, persona fidelity, instruction-following, evaluation protocol  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the evaluation of persona-assigned large language models (LLMs), which are widely applied in fields like education, healthcare, and sociodemographic simulations. The authors note that existing evaluations typically focus on short, single-round interactions, which fail to capture the complexities of real-world use cases involving prolonged dialogues. To bridge this gap, they propose a novel evaluation protocol that utilizes long persona-based dialogues (exceeding 100 rounds) and curated datasets to build dialogue-conditioned benchmarks. These benchmarks effectively measure the impact of extended context on model performance. The study examines seven leading open- and closed-weight LLMs to understand how dialogue length influences three key aspects: persona fidelity, instruction-following, and safety. Results reveal a noticeable decline in persona fidelity over the course of extended conversations, particularly in goal-oriented settings where both persona consistency and adherence to instructions are critical. Additionally, the research identifies a trade-off between maintaining persona fidelity and following instructions, with non-persona models initially outperforming persona-assigned models. Over time, as persona fidelity diminishes, persona responses increasingly resemble those from baseline models without persona constraints. The work underscores the vulnerability of persona-driven LLMs in long interactions and provides a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically detect and analyze such limitations. <div>

Abstract: Persona-assigned large language models (LLMs) are used in domains such as education, healthcare, and sociodemographic simulation. Yet, they are typically evaluated only in short, single-round settings that do not reflect real-world usage. We introduce an evaluation protocol that combines long persona dialogues (over 100 rounds) and evaluation datasets to create dialogue-conditioned benchmarks that can robustly measure long-context effects. We then investigate the effects of dialogue length on persona fidelity, instruction-following, and safety of seven state-of-the-art open- and closed-weight LLMs. We find that persona fidelity degrades over the course of dialogues, especially in goal-oriented conversations, where models must sustain both persona fidelity and instruction following. We identify a trade-off between fidelity and instruction following, with non-persona baselines initially outperforming persona-assigned models; as dialogues progress and fidelity fades, persona responses become increasingly similar to baseline responses. Our findings highlight the fragility of persona applications in extended interactions and our work provides a protocol to systematically measure such failures.

<div> Tokens, Reasoning, State over Tokens (SoT), Large Language Models (LLMs), Computational State<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the nature of reasoning tokens generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) during complex task solving. First, it highlights that although these reasoning tokens appear like human-like thought processes, empirical data shows they do not faithfully represent the true reasoning process inside the model. Second, the authors introduce the State over Tokens (SoT) conceptual framework, which reinterprets reasoning tokens as a form of externalized computational state rather than a linguistic narrative. Third, this framework explains how tokens enable correct reasoning despite not being accurate textual explanations when read by humans. Fourth, SoT sheds light on overlooked research questions related to the understanding and interpretation of these tokens within the model’s generation cycles. Finally, the paper argues that advancing our understanding of LLMs requires moving beyond treating reasoning tokens as mere text and instead focusing on decoding them as stateful computational representations that persist across the model’s stateless operations. <div>
arXiv:2512.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate reasoning tokens before their final answer to boost performance on complex tasks. While these sequences seem like human thought processes, empirical evidence reveals that they are not a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning process. To address this gap between appearance and function, we introduce the State over Tokens (SoT) conceptual framework. SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens. We argue that to truly understand the process that LLMs do, research must move beyond reading the reasoning tokens as text and focus on decoding them as state.

<div> Prompt engineering, linguistic tone, large language models, model performance, domain specificity<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This study investigates the impact of linguistic tone—Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude—on the performance of large language models (LLMs), a previously underexplored aspect of prompt engineering. <br /><br />2. Three recent LLMs, GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google DeepMind), and Llama 4 Scout (Meta), were evaluated using the MMMLU benchmark across six tasks in STEM and Humanities domains. <br /><br />3. Results indicate that tone sensitivity varies by model and domain, with Neutral and Very Friendly prompts generally leading to higher accuracy compared to Very Rude prompts. However, significant effects were mainly observed in Humanities tasks, where rude tones negatively impacted GPT and Llama, but not Gemini. <br /><br />4. When aggregating performance across tasks within each domain, tone effects mostly diminished and lost statistical significance, highlighting the influence of dataset scale and coverage in detecting tone impacts. <br /><br />5. The overall conclusion is that while interaction tone can affect LLM outputs in specific interpretive or nuanced settings, modern LLMs are largely robust to tonal variations in typical mixed-domain applications, offering guidance for prompt design and model choice in practical deployments. <div>
arXiv:2512.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical factor influencing large language model (LLM) performance, yet the impact of pragmatic elements such as linguistic tone and politeness remains underexplored, particularly across different model families. In this work, we propose a systematic evaluation framework to examine how interaction tone affects model accuracy and apply it to three recently released and widely available LLMs: GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google DeepMind), and Llama 4 Scout (Meta). Using the MMMLU benchmark, we evaluate model performance under Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude prompt variants across six tasks spanning STEM and Humanities domains, and analyze pairwise accuracy differences with statistical significance testing.
  Our results show that tone sensitivity is both model-dependent and domain-specific. Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive. When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance. Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects. Overall, our study indicates that while interaction tone can matter in specific interpretive settings, modern LLMs are broadly robust to tonal variation in typical mixed-domain use, providing practical guidance for prompt design and model selection in real-world deployments.

<title>Hindsight is 20/20: Building Agent Memory that Retains, Recalls, and Reflects</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12818</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: agent memory, structured memory architecture, long-horizon conversations, reasoning, open-source models<br /><br />Summary: The paper introduces Hindsight, a novel memory architecture designed to enhance LLM-based agents by treating memory as a structured, integral component for reasoning rather than an external add-on. Hindsight organizes memory into four logical networks distinguishing world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. The system supports three core operations—retain, recall, and reflect—that manage how information is added, accessed, and updated within the memory. This approach allows a temporal, entity-aware memory layer to convert conversational streams into a structured and queryable memory bank. Additionally, a reflection layer performs reasoning over this memory to generate answers and update information in a traceable manner. Evaluated on challenging long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks such as LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight significantly improves accuracy, lifting performance from 39% to 83.6% using an open-source 20B parameter model compared to a full-context baseline with the same backbone. When scaling the model, Hindsight achieves even higher accuracy levels (up to 91.4% on LongMemEval and 89.61% on LoCoMo), outperforming GPT-4o and previous top open systems. Overall, Hindsight offers a robust framework for multi-session, open-domain question answering by addressing previous systems’ limitations related to evidence versus inference, long-term organization, and explainability. <div>
arXiv:2512.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent memory has been touted as a dimension of growth for LLM-based applications, enabling agents that can accumulate experience, adapt across sessions, and move beyond single-shot question answering. The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions.

<div> Keywords: automatic evaluation, long-form stories, evaluation criteria, benchmarking, NovelCritique<br /><br />Summary: In this work, the authors address the challenging task of automatically evaluating book-length stories exceeding 100,000 tokens. Their study centers on two key questions: identifying which evaluation aspects are most important to readers and determining effective methods for assessing lengthy narratives. They introduce LongStoryEval, the first large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 600 recently published books averaging 121,000 tokens, each with average ratings and multiple reader reviews organized by evaluation aspects. By analyzing user feedback, the authors propose a structured set of evaluation criteria and identify the most significant aspects among eight top-level criteria. For evaluation methods, they compare three approaches: aggregation-based, incremental-updated, and summary-based evaluations. Their findings show that aggregation- and summary-based methods outperform the incremental approach; aggregation excels in detailed assessment, whereas summary-based evaluation offers better efficiency. Based on these insights, the team presents NovelCritique, an 8-billion parameter model that uses the efficient summary-based framework to review and score stories across specified aspects. NovelCritique demonstrates superior alignment with human evaluations compared to commercial models such as GPT-4o. The authors also provide their datasets and code publicly at the linked GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: In this work, we conduct systematic research in a challenging area: the automatic evaluation of book-length stories (>100K tokens). Our study focuses on two key questions: (1) understanding which evaluation aspects matter most to readers, and (2) exploring effective methods for evaluating lengthy stories. We introduce the first large-scale benchmark, LongStoryEval, comprising 600 newly published books with an average length of 121K tokens (maximum 397K). Each book includes its average rating and multiple reader reviews, presented as critiques organized by evaluation aspects. By analyzing all user-mentioned aspects, we propose an evaluation criteria structure and conduct experiments to identify the most significant aspects among the 8 top-level criteria. For evaluation methods, we compare the effectiveness of three types: aggregation-based, incremental-updated, and summary-based evaluations. Our findings reveal that aggregation- and summary-based evaluations perform better, with the former excelling in detail assessment and the latter offering greater efficiency. Building on these insights, we further propose NovelCritique, an 8B model that leverages the efficient summary-based framework to review and score stories across specified aspects. NovelCritique outperforms commercial models like GPT-4o in aligning with human evaluations. Our datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/DingyiYang/LongStoryEval.

<div> Keywords: large language models, clinical diagnosis, probabilistic reasoning, Naive Bayes, MedQA  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. This paper evaluates how much large language models' (LLMs) performance on clinical diagnosis multiple-choice benchmarks reflects underlying probabilistic reasoning.  
2. The authors introduce the Frequency-Based Probabilistic Ranker (FBPR), a lightweight method that uses a smoothed Naive Bayes approach over concept-diagnosis co-occurrence statistics extracted from a large corpus to score diagnosis options.  
3. FBPR, when using co-occurrence statistics sourced from the same pretraining corpora as the LLMs OLMo and Llama, matches their performance on the MedQA benchmark.  
4. The sets of questions correctly answered by direct LLM inference and by FBPR largely differ, with only a small overlap slightly above random chance, indicating that these two methods have complementary strengths.  
5. The findings suggest that explicit probabilistic baselines like FBPR remain valuable as performance reference points and can provide additional signals for hybrid methods, showing that a simple frequency-based expert system still explains a significant part of benchmark success even though LLMs' mechanisms extend beyond frequency aggregation. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on multiple-choice clinical diagnosis benchmarks, yet it is unclear how much of this performance reflects underlying probabilistic reasoning. We study this through questions from MedQA, where the task is to select the most likely diagnosis. We introduce the Frequency-Based Probabilistic Ranker (FBPR), a lightweight method that scores options with a smoothed Naive Bayes over concept-diagnosis co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus. When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization. While the performance of LLMs seems to be driven by a mechanism other than simple frequency aggregation, we show that an approach similar to the historically grounded, low-complexity expert systems still accounts for a substantial portion of benchmark performance.

<div> Keywords: multilingual legal terminology, human-AI collaboration, multi-agent framework, Chinese-Japanese legal texts, terminology mapping<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The article addresses the challenge of accurately mapping legal terminology across languages, particularly focusing on Chinese and Japanese, which share many homographs with differing meanings, complicating automated alignment. 2. It highlights the scarcity of existing resources and standardized tools tailored for legal terminology mapping in these languages. 3. To tackle this, the authors propose a novel human-AI collaborative approach utilizing a multi-agent framework that integrates large language models and legal domain experts at every stage—from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, terminology extraction, mapping, to quality control. 4. The approach clearly delineates roles: AI agents perform repetitive tasks such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts oversee, review, and supervise to ensure outputs are contextually and legally accurate. 5. Experimental evaluation employed a trilingual parallel corpus of 35 principal Chinese statutes with their English and Japanese translations, demonstrating that this multi-agent, human-in-the-loop system improves precision, consistency, and scalability over traditional manual methods for legal terminology mapping. <div>

Abstract: Accurately mapping legal terminology across languages remains a significant challenge, especially for language pairs like Chinese and Japanese, which share a large number of homographs with different meanings. Existing resources and standardized tools for these languages are limited. To address this, we propose a human-AI collaborative approach for building a multilingual legal terminology database, based on a multi-agent framework. This approach integrates advanced large language models and legal domain experts throughout the entire process-from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, to terminology extraction, mapping, and quality assurance. Unlike a single automated pipeline, our approach places greater emphasis on how human experts participate in this multi-agent system. Humans and AI agents take on different roles: AI agents handle specific, repetitive tasks, such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts provide crucial oversight, review, and supervise the outputs with contextual knowledge and legal judgment. We tested the effectiveness of this framework using a trilingual parallel corpus comprising 35 key Chinese statutes, along with their English and Japanese translations. The experimental results show that this human-in-the-loop, multi-agent workflow not only improves the precision and consistency of multilingual legal terminology mapping but also offers greater scalability compared to traditional manual methods.

<div> Keywords: QwenLong-L1.5, long-context reasoning, data synthesis pipeline, reinforcement learning, memory-augmented architecture<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. QwenLong-L1.5 is a model designed to achieve superior long-context reasoning capabilities through key post-training innovations.<br /><br />2. The Long-Context Data Synthesis Pipeline systematically generates challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks by decomposing documents into atomic facts and relationships, then programmatically composing verifiable reasoning questions. This approach enables large-scale, high-quality training data beyond simple retrieval.<br /><br />3.

Abstract: We introduce QwenLong-L1.5, a model that achieves superior long-context reasoning capabilities through systematic post-training innovations. The key technical breakthroughs of QwenLong-L1.5 are as follows: (1) Long-Context Data Synthesis Pipeline: We develop a systematic synthesis framework that generates challenging reasoning tasks requiring multi-hop grounding over globally distributed evidence. By deconstructing documents into atomic facts and their underlying relationships, and then programmatically composing verifiable reasoning questions, our approach creates high-quality training data at scale, moving substantially beyond simple retrieval tasks to enable genuine long-range reasoning capabilities. (2) Stabilized Reinforcement Learning for Long-Context Training: To overcome the critical instability in long-context RL, we introduce task-balanced sampling with task-specific advantage estimation to mitigate reward bias, and propose Adaptive Entropy-Controlled Policy Optimization (AEPO) that dynamically regulates exploration-exploitation trade-offs. (3) Memory-Augmented Architecture for Ultra-Long Contexts: Recognizing that even extended context windows cannot accommodate arbitrarily long sequences, we develop a memory management framework with multi-stage fusion RL training that seamlessly integrates single-pass reasoning with iterative memory-based processing for tasks exceeding 4M tokens. Based on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, QwenLong-L1.5 achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on long-context reasoning benchmarks, surpassing its baseline by 9.90 points on average. On ultra-long tasks (1M~4M tokens), QwenLong-L1.5's memory-agent framework yields a 9.48-point gain over the agent baseline. Additionally, the acquired long-context reasoning ability translates to enhanced performance in general domains like scientific reasoning, memory tool using, and extended dialogue.

<div> author labeling, sentiment analysis, product recommendation, online learning, annotation quality<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper introduces "author labeling," a novel annotation technique where the document's writer directly annotates subjective features at the time of creation, improving the accuracy of egocentric data like sentiment and belief compared to traditional third-party annotations.<br /><br />2. The authors implemented this technique in collaboration with a commercial chatbot used by over 10,000 users, focusing on subjective features relevant to product recommendation.<br /><br />3. Their system dynamically identifies relevant queries, generates real-time labeling questions, and captures the authors' responses, enabling continuous data collection during content creation.<br /><br />4. They developed and deployed an online learning model for product recommendation that leverages author labeling to continuously improve, achieving a 534% increase in click-through rate compared to an industry-standard advertising baseline.<br /><br />5. By comparing author labeling to three traditional annotation methods for sentiment analysis, the study shows that author labeling produces higher quality annotations that are acquired faster and at lower cost.<br /><br />6. The findings reinforce existing literature that annotations related to subjective and egocentric features are more reliable when provided by the original authors rather than third-party annotators.<br /><br />7. To encourage wider adoption, the authors have released an author labeling service for the research community at academic.echollm.io. <div>

Abstract: The status quo for labeling text is third-party annotation, but there are many cases where information directly from the document's source would be preferable over a third-person proxy, especially for egocentric features like sentiment and belief. We introduce author labeling, an annotation technique where the writer of the document itself annotates the data at the moment of creation. We collaborate with a commercial chatbot with over 10,000 users to deploy an author labeling annotation system for subjective features related to product recommendation. This system identifies task-relevant queries, generates on-the-fly labeling questions, and records authors' answers in real time. We train and deploy an online-learning model architecture for product recommendation that continuously improves from author labeling and find it achieved a 534% increase in click-through rate compared to an industry advertising baseline running concurrently. We then compare the quality and practicality of author labeling to three traditional annotation approaches for sentiment analysis and find author labeling to be higher quality, faster to acquire, and cheaper. These findings reinforce existing literature that annotations, especially for egocentric and subjective beliefs, are significantly higher quality when labeled by the author rather than a third party. To facilitate broader scientific adoption, we release an author labeling service for the research community at academic.echollm.io.

<div> Keywords: bilateral negotiation, concession dynamics, large language models, power asymmetry, strategy adaptation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the complexities of bilateral negotiation, emphasizing how human negotiators dynamically adjust their strategies such as anchors, pacing, and flexibility based on power asymmetries and informal cues. The authors introduce a unified mathematical framework to model concession dynamics using a hyperbolic tangent curve. They also propose two quantitative metrics—burstiness tau and the Concession-Rigidity Index (CRI)—to measure the timing and rigidity of offer trajectories during negotiation. A large-scale empirical comparison is conducted between human negotiators and four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) across different settings, including natural-language and numeric offers, with varying levels of market context and six controlled power-asymmetry scenarios. Results show that humans adapt smoothly to changing situations, inferring opponent strategies, while LLMs tend to anchor at extreme points within the negotiation zone and optimize for fixed points regardless of leverage or context. Qualitative analysis reveals that LLMs demonstrate limited strategic diversity and sometimes employ deceptive tactics. Furthermore, improvements in LLM architecture do not translate to better negotiation performance. The study highlights fundamental limitations in current LLM negotiation capabilities and suggests the need for future models that can better internalize opponent reasoning and adjust strategies contextually. <div>

Abstract: Bilateral negotiation is a complex, context-sensitive task in which human negotiators dynamically adjust anchors, pacing, and flexibility to exploit power asymmetries and informal cues. We introduce a unified mathematical framework for modeling concession dynamics based on a hyperbolic tangent curve, and propose two metrics burstiness tau and the Concession-Rigidity Index (CRI) to quantify the timing and rigidity of offer trajectories. We conduct a large-scale empirical comparison between human negotiators and four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) across natural-language and numeric-offers settings, with and without rich market context, as well as six controlled power-asymmetry scenarios. Our results reveal that, unlike humans who smoothly adapt to situations and infer the opponents position and strategies, LLMs systematically anchor at extremes of the possible agreement zone for negotiations and optimize for fixed points irrespective of leverage or context. Qualitative analysis further shows limited strategy diversity and occasional deceptive tactics used by LLMs. Moreover the ability of LLMs to negotiate does not improve with better models. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in current LLM negotiation capabilities and point to the need for models that better internalize opponent reasoning and context-dependent strategy.

<title>Uncovering the Role of Initial Saliency in U-Shaped Attention Bias: Scaling Initial Token Weight for Enhanced Long-Text Processing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13109</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13109</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: large language models, long-text sequences, lost in the middle, attention bias, initial saliency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across various natural language processing tasks but face challenges when handling long-text sequences, primarily due to the "lost in the middle" phenomenon. This occurs because of a U-shaped attention bias where the model disproportionately focuses on the beginning and end of the text, neglecting the middle portions. Previous work mainly linked this bias to the position encoding mechanism. However, this study identifies an additional contributing factor called initial saliency, where tokens that have higher attention weights relative to the initial token receive more attention in predicting the next token. By exploiting this insight, the authors propose scaling the attention weights between the initial token and other tokens to better distribute attention throughout the entire sequence. This adjustment leads to improved performance on long-context tasks, demonstrated by a maximum accuracy gain of 3.6% on the MDQA dataset. Furthermore, integrating this initial saliency-based scaling approach with existing methods targeting position encoding bias results in further performance boosts, with up to 3.4% improvement observed on KV-Retrieval tasks. This work reveals a new dimension to attention bias and provides practical techniques for enhancing LLMs’ ability to process extended text inputs effectively. <div>
arXiv:2512.13109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\% in KV-Retrieval tasks.

<div> Speculative Decoding, Adaptive Rejection Sampling, Large Language Models, Inference Efficiency, Predictive Uncertainty  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses a critical limitation in Speculative Decoding, a technique used to speed up autoregressive inference in large language models (LLMs). Traditional Speculative Decoding employs a fixed, context-independent threshold for rejection sampling, which leads to random rejections of plausible candidate tokens especially in scenarios with high uncertainty. To overcome this, the authors propose Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold based on the target model’s predictive uncertainty. This uncertainty is quantified as \(1 - \max(P_{\mathrm{target}})\), and a tolerance term proportional to this measure is introduced to relax the acceptance criteria when the model is uncertain. Consequently, EARS significantly reduces random rejections without compromising strictness when confidence is high. Experimental results on creative writing and open-domain question answering tasks demonstrate that EARS improves throughput by up to 18.12%, while incurring only a minimal accuracy drop of 0.84% on the GSM8K benchmark. Importantly, this method requires no changes to underlying model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks, making it a practical and efficient enhancement for accelerating LLM inference. <div>
arXiv:2512.13194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding is a prominent technique for accelerating the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a fast draft model to propose candidate token sequences and a large target model to verify them in parallel. However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant "random rejection" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \(1 - \max(P_{\mathrm{target}})\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks.

<div> Agentic reinforcement learning, dynamic tool selection, large language models, multi-step reasoning, AutoTool<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces AutoTool, a novel framework designed to enhance large language model (LLM) agents by enabling dynamic tool selection throughout their reasoning processes, overcoming the limitations of fixed tool inventories. The authors build a large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 examples with explicit tool-selection rationales, covering over 1,000 tools and more than 100 tasks across diverse domains including mathematics, science, code generation, and multimodal reasoning. AutoTool employs a dual-phase optimization pipeline: first, supervised learning combined with reinforcement learning stabilizes the reasoning trajectories for coherence; second, a KL-regularized Plackett-Luce ranking mechanism refines the selection consistency over multiple steps. Experiments involve training two base models, Qwen3-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, with AutoTool and evaluating them on ten diverse benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoTool consistently outperforms existing advanced LLM agents and tool-integration approaches despite having fewer parameters. Performance improvements include average gains of 6.4% in math and science reasoning, 4.5% in search-based question answering, 7.7% in code generation, and 6.9% in multimodal understanding. Finally, AutoTool also shows superior generalization abilities by effectively leveraging previously unseen tools from evolving toolsets during inference, making it adaptable to new and changing environments. <div>

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning has advanced large language models (LLMs) to reason through long chain-of-thought trajectories while interleaving external tool use. Existing approaches assume a fixed inventory of tools, limiting LLM agents' adaptability to new or evolving toolsets. We present AutoTool, a framework that equips LLM agents with dynamic tool-selection capabilities throughout their reasoning trajectories. We first construct a 200k dataset with explicit tool-selection rationales across 1,000+ tools and 100+ tasks spanning mathematics, science, code generation, and multimodal reasoning. Building on this data foundation, AutoTool employs a dual-phase optimization pipeline: (i) supervised and RL-based trajectory stabilization for coherent reasoning, and (ii) KL-regularized Plackett-Luce ranking to refine consistent multi-step tool selection. Across ten diverse benchmarks, we train two base models, Qwen3-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, with AutoTool. With fewer parameters, AutoTool consistently outperforms advanced LLM agents and tool-integration methods, yielding average gains of 6.4% in math & science reasoning, 4.5% in search-based QA, 7.7% in code generation, and 6.9% in multimodal understanding. In addition, AutoTool exhibits stronger generalization by dynamically leveraging unseen tools from evolving toolsets during inference.

<title>AIR: Post-training Data Selection for Reasoning via Attention Head Influence</title>

<div> Keywords: LLMs, reasoning distillation, attention heads, data selection, post-training fine-tuning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive multi-step reasoning abilities, but effectively transferring these skills through post-training distillation remains difficult. Traditional data selection strategies, including manual curation and heuristics based on factors like length, entropy, or loss, fail to accurately identify the causal importance of individual reasoning steps, limiting the efficiency of distillation. To overcome this limitation, the paper introduces Attention Influence for Reasoning (AIR), a new framework that is principled, unsupervised, and requires no additional training. AIR leverages mechanistic insights from the retrieval attention heads of pre-existing models to pinpoint which heads are most critical for reasoning. It then creates a weakened reference model by disabling the influence of these key attention heads and measures the change in loss to compute an Attention Influence Score. This score enables detailed assessments both at the level of individual reasoning steps and entire samples, facilitating refined step-level weighted fine-tuning and selective sample usage. Experimental results across various reasoning benchmarks confirm that AIR consistently enhances reasoning accuracy, outperforming heuristic baseline methods by better isolating the most crucial reasoning components. Overall, the work presents a mechanism-driven, data-efficient technique for improving reasoning skill transfer in LLM post-training distillation. <div>
arXiv:2512.13279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs achieve remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, yet effectively transferring these skills via post-training distillation remains challenging. Existing data selection methods, ranging from manual curation to heuristics based on length, entropy, or overall loss, fail to capture the causal importance of individual reasoning steps, limiting distillation efficiency. To address this, we propose Attention Influence for Reasoning (AIR), a principled, unsupervised and training-free framework that leverages mechanistic insights of the retrieval head to select high-value post-training data. AIR first identifies reasoning-critical attention heads of an off-the-shelf model, then constructs a weakened reference model with disabled head influence, and finally quantifies the resulting loss divergence as the Attention Influence Score. This score enables fine-grained assessment at both the step and sample levels, supporting step-level weighted fine-tuning and global sample selection. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that AIR consistently improves reasoning accuracy, surpassing heuristic baselines and effectively isolating the most critical steps and samples. Our work establishes a mechanism-driven, data-efficient approach for reasoning distillation in LLMs.

<div> Keywords: fact-checking, causal reasoning, event relation extraction, semantic similarity, explainability<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses a current limitation in automated fact-checking systems, which often fail to incorporate causal-based reasoning when validating claims. 2.

This approach enables fine-grained causal event relationship analysis, improving the semantic richness and explainability of verdict predictions in fact-checking tasks. 5.

Abstract: In fact-checking applications, a common reason to reject a claim is to detect the presence of erroneous cause-effect relationships between the events at play. However, current automated fact-checking methods lack dedicated causal-based reasoning, potentially missing a valuable opportunity for semantically rich explainability. To address this gap, we propose a methodology that combines event relation extraction, semantic similarity computation, and rule-based reasoning to detect logical inconsistencies between chains of events mentioned in a claim and in an evidence. Evaluated on two fact-checking datasets, this method establishes the first baseline for integrating fine-grained causal event relationships into fact-checking and enhance explainability of verdict prediction.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Large language models, multilingual, MiniLingua, instruction tuning, European languages<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper presents MiniLingua, a compact multilingual large language model (LLM) with around one billion parameters, designed specifically for 13 European languages. Unlike many existing LLMs, MiniLingua is trained entirely from scratch to provide a balance between broad language coverage and strong instruction-following abilities. The motivation behind MiniLingua addresses common limitations of large models such as high computational costs, privacy issues, and a predominant focus on English. The authors conducted extensive evaluations demonstrating that the instruction-tuned MiniLingua surpasses EuroLLM—a comparable model with a bigger training budget—in tasks like summarization, classification, and both open- and closed-book question answering. Additionally, MiniLingua holds its own against more advanced state-of-the-art models when performing open-ended text generation tasks. Importantly, the project ensures transparency and accessibility by releasing model weights, the tokenizer, and the full source code used for data processing and training, enabling the community to utilize and further develop the model. This contribution shows that smaller, efficient LLMs can achieve competitive performance while being more resource-friendly and inclusive of multiple European languages. <div>

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but often limited by high computational cost, privacy concerns, and English-centric training. Recent progress demonstrates that small, efficient models with around one billion parameters can deliver strong results and enable on-device use. This paper introduces MiniLingua, a multilingual open-source LLM of one billion parameters trained from scratch for 13 European languages, designed to balance coverage and instruction-following capabilities. Based on evaluation results, the instruction-tuned version of MiniLingua outperforms EuroLLM, a model with a similar training approach but a larger training budget, on summarization, classification and both open- and closed-book question answering. Moreover, it remains competitive with more advanced state-of-the-art models on open-ended generation tasks. We release model weights, tokenizer and source code used for data processing and model training.

<div> Emotion Drift, Mental Health, Sentiment Analysis, Transformer Models, Emotional Dynamics<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study explores the concept of emotion drift, which is defined as the variation in emotional state within a single text message, specifically focusing on mental health-related communications. Unlike conventional sentiment analysis that categorizes whole messages as positive, negative, or neutral, this research emphasizes detecting subtle changes in emotions at the sentence level. To achieve this, the study employs pre-trained transformer models such as DistilBERT and RoBERTa for identifying emotions throughout the text. By calculating emotion drift scores, the research reveals patterns of emotional escalation or relief during mental health conversations. These findings contribute valuable insights into the dynamic emotional processes occurring within textual content. Furthermore, the proposed methodology offers a framework to better understand emotional fluctuations and their progression over time in mental health discourse, potentially enhancing support mechanisms and therapeutic interventions. Overall, this approach advances sentiment analysis by moving beyond static classification to capture emotional dynamics within messages. <div>

Abstract: This study investigates emotion drift: the change in emotional state across a single text, within mental health-related messages. While sentiment analysis typically classifies an entire message as positive, negative, or neutral, the nuanced shift of emotions over the course of a message is often overlooked. This study detects sentence-level emotions and measures emotion drift scores using pre-trained transformer models such as DistilBERT and RoBERTa. The results provide insights into patterns of emotional escalation or relief in mental health conversations. This methodology can be applied to better understand emotional dynamics in content.

Abstract: Large Language Models are useless for linguistics, as they are probabilistic models that require a vast amount of data to analyse externalized strings of words. In contrast, human language is underpinned by a mind-internal computational system that recursively generates hierarchical thought structures. The language system grows with minimal external input and can readily distinguish between real language and impossible languages.

<title>Scaling Laws for Code: Every Programming Language Matters</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13472</link>

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) are powerful but costly to train, with scaling laws predicting performance from model size, data, and compute. However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget.

<title>Non-Resolution Reasoning: A Framework for Preserving Semantic Ambiguity in Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13478</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13478</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Premature semantic collapse -- the forced early commitment to a single meaning -- remains a core architectural limitation of current language models. Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing "Dr. Smith the cardiologist" from "Dr. Smith the researcher"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $\rho$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control.

Abstract: Bangla is the sixth most widely spoken language globally, with approximately 234 million native speakers. However, progress in open-source Bangla machine translation remains limited. Most online resources are in English and often remain untranslated into Bangla, excluding millions from accessing essential information. Existing research in Bangla translation primarily focuses on formal language, neglecting the more commonly used informal language. This is largely due to the lack of pairwise Bangla-English data and advanced translation models. If datasets and models can be enhanced to better handle natural, informal Bangla, millions of people will benefit from improved online information access. In this research, we explore current state-of-the-art models and propose improvements to Bangla translation by developing a dataset from informal sources like social media and conversational texts. This work aims to advance Bangla machine translation by focusing on informal language translation and improving accessibility for Bangla speakers in the digital world.

<title>SkipCat: Rank-Maximized Low-Rank Compression of Large Language Models via Shared Projection and Block Skipping</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, na\"ive low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints.

Abstract: This work introduces {\it PrahokBART}, a compact pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model trained from scratch for Khmer using carefully curated Khmer and English corpora. We focus on improving the pre-training corpus quality and addressing the linguistic issues of Khmer, which are ignored in existing multilingual models, by incorporating linguistic components such as word segmentation and normalization. We evaluate PrahokBART on three generative tasks: machine translation, text summarization, and headline generation, where our results demonstrate that it outperforms mBART50, a strong multilingual pre-trained model. Additionally, our analysis provides insights into the impact of each linguistic module and evaluates how effectively our model handles space during text generation, which is crucial for the naturalness of texts in Khmer.

<title>Verifying Rumors via Stance-Aware Structural Modeling</title>

Abstract: Verifying rumors on social media is critical for mitigating the spread of false information. The stances of conversation replies often provide important cues to determine a rumor's veracity. However, existing models struggle to jointly capture semantic content, stance information, and conversation strructure, especially under the sequence length constraints of transformer-based encoders. In this work, we propose a stance-aware structural modeling that encodes each post in a discourse with its stance signal and aggregates reply embedddings by stance category enabling a scalable and semantically enriched representation of the entire thread. To enhance structural awareness, we introduce stance distribution and hierarchical depth as covariates, capturing stance imbalance and the influence of reply depth. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior methods in the ability to predict truthfulness of a rumor. We also demonstrate that our model is versatile for early detection and cross-platfrom generalization.

Abstract: Memory has emerged, and will continue to remain, a core capability of foundation model-based agents. As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence.

<title>ReFusion: A Diffusion Large Language Model with Parallel Autoregressive Decoding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) are hindered by slow sequential inference. While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\times$ average speedup.

Abstract: A well-engineered prompt can increase the performance of large language models; automatic prompt optimization techniques aim to increase performance without requiring human effort to tune the prompts. One leading class of prompt optimization techniques introduces the analogy of textual gradients. We investigate the behavior of these textual gradient methods through a series of experiments and case studies. While such methods often result in a performance improvement, our experiments suggest that the gradient analogy does not accurately explain their behavior. Our insights may inform the selection of prompt optimization strategies, and development of new approaches.

arXiv:2512.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building general-purpose reasoning models with reinforcement learning (RL) entails substantial cross-domain heterogeneity, including large variation in inference-time response lengths and verification latency. Such variability complicates the RL infrastructure, slows training, and makes training curriculum (e.g., response length extension) and hyperparameter selection challenging. In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes. Departing from conventional approaches that blend heterogeneous prompts from different domains, Cascade RL orchestrates sequential, domain-wise RL, reducing engineering complexity and delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, RLHF for alignment, when used as a pre-step, boosts the model's reasoning ability far beyond mere preference optimization, and subsequent domain-wise RLVR stages rarely degrade the benchmark performance attained in earlier domains and may even improve it (see an illustration in Figure 1). Our 14B model, after RL, outperforms its SFT teacher, DeepSeek-R1-0528, on LiveCodeBench v5/v6/Pro and achieves silver-medal performance in the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We transparently share our training and data recipes.

arXiv:2512.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing continuous time is a critical and under-explored challenge in modeling temporal event sequences with large language models (LLMs). Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) have been shown to respond in a variety of ways for classification tasks outside of question-answering. LLM responses are sometimes called "hallucinations" since the output is not what is ex pected. Memorization strategies in LLMs are being studied in detail, with the goal of understanding how LLMs respond. We perform a deep dive into a classification task based on United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions. The SCOTUS corpus is an ideal classification task to study for LLM memory accuracy because it presents significant challenges due to extensive sentence length, complex legal terminology, non-standard structure, and domain-specific vocabulary. Experimentation is performed with the latest LLM fine tuning and retrieval-based approaches, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, auto-modeling, and others, on two traditional category-based SCOTUS classification tasks: one with 15 labeled topics and another with 279. We show that prompt-based models with memories, such as DeepSeek, can be more robust than previous BERT-based models on both tasks scoring about 2 points better than previous models not based on prompting.

Abstract: Safety alignment mechanisms in large language models prevent responses to harmful queries through learned refusal behavior, yet these same mechanisms impede legitimate research applications including cognitive modeling, adversarial testing, and security analysis. While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture.

Abstract: Forensic scientists often need to identify an unknown speaker or writer in cases such as ransom calls, covert recordings, alleged suicide notes, or anonymous online communications, among many others. Speaker recognition in the speech domain usually examines phonetic or acoustic properties of a voice, and these methods can be accurate and robust under certain conditions. However, if a speaker disguises their voice or employs text-to-speech software, vocal properties may no longer be reliable, leaving only their linguistic content available for analysis. Authorship attribution methods traditionally use syntactic, semantic, and related linguistic information to identify writers of written text (authorship attribution). In this paper, we apply a content-based authorship approach to speech that has been transcribed into text, using what a speaker says to attribute speech to individuals (speaker attribution). We introduce a stylometric method, StyloSpeaker, which incorporates character, word, token, sentence, and style features from the stylometric literature on authorship, to assess whether two transcripts were produced by the same speaker. We evaluate this method on two types of transcript formatting: one approximating prescriptive written text with capitalization and punctuation and another normalized style that removes these conventions. The transcripts' conversation topics are also controlled to varying degrees. We find generally higher attribution performance on normalized transcripts, except under the strongest topic control condition, in which overall performance is highest. Finally, we compare this more explainable stylometric model to black-box neural approaches on the same data and investigate which stylistic features most effectively distinguish speakers.

<title>Towards Effective Model Editing for LLM Personalization</title>

Abstract: Personalization is becoming indispensable for LLMs to align with individual user preferences and needs. Yet current approaches are often computationally expensive, data-intensive, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and prone to performance degradation in multi-turn interactions or when handling implicit queries. To address these challenges, we conceptualize personalization as a model editing task and introduce Personalization Editing, a framework that applies localized edits guided by clustered preference representations. This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty. Unlike prior benchmarks, UPQA directly evaluates a model's ability to recall and apply specific user preferences. Across experimental settings, Personalization Editing achieves higher editing accuracy and greater computational efficiency than fine-tuning, while outperforming prompting-based baselines in multi-turn conversations and implicit preference questions settings.

<title>Beyond surface form: A pipeline for semantic analysis in Alzheimer's Disease detection from spontaneous speech</title>

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that adversely affects cognitive abilities. Language-related changes can be automatically identified through the analysis of outputs from linguistic assessment tasks, such as picture description. Language models show promise as a basis for screening tools for AD, but their limited interpretability poses a challenge in distinguishing true linguistic markers of cognitive decline from surface-level textual patterns. To address this issue, we examine how surface form variation affects classification performance, with the goal of assessing the ability of language models to represent underlying semantic indicators. We introduce a novel approach where texts surface forms are transformed by altering syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantic content. The transformations significantly modify the structure and lexical content, as indicated by low BLEU and chrF scores, yet retain the underlying semantics, as reflected in high semantic similarity scores, isolating the effect of semantic information, and finding models perform similarly to if they were using the original text, with only small deviations in macro-F1. We also investigate whether language from picture descriptions retains enough detail to reconstruct the original image using generative models. We found that image-based transformations add substantial noise reducing classification accuracy. Our methodology provides a novel way of looking at what features influence model predictions, and allows the removal of possible spurious correlations. We find that just using semantic information, language model based classifiers can still detect AD. This work shows that difficult to detect semantic impairment can be identified, addressing an overlooked feature of linguistic deterioration, and opening new pathways for early detection systems.

Abstract: This paper argues that contemporary large language models (LLMs) can contribute to psychotic involvement by creating interactions that resemble the relational dynamics of folie a deux. Drawing on Bateson's double bind theory, clinical literature on shared psychotic disorder, and McGilchrist's hemisphere theory, we show how the combination of high linguistic coherence and the absence of an underlying subject produces a structural tension for the user: language suggests an interlocutor, while intuition registers a void. In contexts of emotional need or instability, this tension can lead users to resolve the conflict through imaginative projection, attributing interiority, intention, or presence to a system that possesses none. The paper situates these dynamics within emerging clinical reports, develops a phenomenological account of how they unfold, and argues that current engagement-optimised design choices exacerbate the risk. We conclude by proposing 'ontological honesty' as a necessary design principle for mitigating technologically mediated folie a deux.

Abstract: We propose Love First, Know Later: a paradigm shift in computational matching that simulates interactions first, then assesses compatibility. Instead of comparing static profiles, our framework leverages LLMs as text world engines that operate in dual capacity-as persona-driven agents following behavioral policies and as the environment modeling interaction dynamics. We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals from simulations that predict human preferences. Our key insight is that relationships hinge on responses to critical moments-we translate this observation from relationship psychology into mathematical hypotheses, enabling effective simulation. Theoretically, we prove that as LLM policies better approximate human behavior, the induced matching converges to optimal stable matching. Empirically, we validate on speed dating data for initial chemistry and divorce prediction for long-term stability. This paradigm enables interactive, personalized matching systems where users iteratively refine their agents, unlocking future possibilities for transparent and interactive compatibility assessment.

Abstract: Stocks can't be predicted. Despite many hopes, this premise held itself true for many years due to the nature of quantitative stock data lacking causal logic along with rapid market changes hindering accumulation of significant data for training models. To undertake this matter, we propose a novel framework, TopicProphet, to analyze historical eras that share similar public sentiment trends and historical background. Our research deviates from previous studies that identified impacts of keywords and sentiments - we expand on that method by a sequence of topic modeling, temporal analysis, breakpoint detection and segment optimization to detect the optimal time period for training. This results in improving predictions by providing the model with nuanced patterns that occur from that era's socioeconomic and political status while also resolving the shortage of pertinent stock data to train on. Through extensive analysis, we conclude that TopicProphet produces improved outcomes compared to the state-of-the-art methods in capturing the optimal training data for forecasting financial percentage changes.

Abstract: The development of robust Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is bottlenecked by the scarcity of "Long-Tail" training data. While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a "System 2" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model "Judge-Scout" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40\% compared to single models. The system runs entirely on consumer hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3090), offering a privacy-preserving alternative to the cloud.

<title>The Instability of Safety: How Random Seeds and Temperature Expose Inconsistent LLM Refusal Behavior</title>

Abstract: Current safety evaluations of large language models rely on single-shot testing, implicitly assuming that model responses are deterministic and representative of the model's safety alignment. We challenge this assumption by investigating the stability of safety refusal decisions across random seeds and temperature settings. Testing four instruction-tuned models from three families (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 3 8B, Gemma 3 12B) on 876 harmful prompts across 20 different sampling configurations (4 temperatures x 5 random seeds), we find that 18-28% of prompts exhibit decision flips--the model refuses in some configurations but complies in others--depending on the model. Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62). These findings demonstrate that single-shot safety evaluations are insufficient for reliable safety assessment. We show that single-shot evaluation agrees with multi-sample ground truth only 92.4% of the time, and recommend using at least 3 samples per prompt for reliable safety assessment.

<title>Rethinking Jailbreak Detection of Large Vision Language Models with Representational Contrastive Scoring</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to a growing array of multimodal jailbreak attacks, necessitating defenses that are both generalizable to novel threats and efficient for practical deployment. Many current strategies fall short, either targeting specific attack patterns, which limits generalization, or imposing high computational overhead. While lightweight anomaly-detection methods offer a promising direction, we find that their common one-class design tends to confuse novel benign inputs with malicious ones, leading to unreliable over-rejection. To address this, we propose Representational Contrastive Scoring (RCS), a framework built on a key insight: the most potent safety signals reside within the LVLM's own internal representations. Our approach inspects the internal geometry of these representations, learning a lightweight projection to maximally separate benign and malicious inputs in safety-critical layers. This enables a simple yet powerful contrastive score that differentiates true malicious intent from mere novelty. Our instantiations, MCD (Mahalanobis Contrastive Detection) and KCD (K-nearest Contrastive Detection), achieve state-of-the-art performance on a challenging evaluation protocol designed to test generalization to unseen attack types. This work demonstrates that effective jailbreak detection can be achieved by applying simple, interpretable statistical methods to the appropriate internal representations, offering a practical path towards safer LVLM deployment. Our code is available on Github https://github.com/sarendis56/Jailbreak_Detection_RCS.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive ability to jointly reason over visual and textual inputs. However, they often produce outputs that are linguistically fluent but factually inconsistent with the visual evidence, i.e., they hallucinate. Despite growing efforts to mitigate such hallucinations, a key question remains: what form of visual attention can effectively suppress hallucinations during decoding? In this work, we provide a simple answer: the vision encoder's own attention map. We show that LVLMs tend to hallucinate when their final visual-attention maps fail to concentrate on key image objects, whereas the vision encoder's more concentrated attention maps substantially reduce hallucinations. To further investigate the cause, we analyze vision-text conflicts during decoding and find that these conflicts peak in the language model's middle layers. Injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into these layers effectively suppresses hallucinations. Building on these insights, we introduce VEGAS, a simple yet effective inference-time method that integrates the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers and adaptively steers tokens which fail to concentrate on key image objects. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VEGAS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Prior works on training software engineering agents have explored utilizing existing resources such as issues on GitHub repositories to construct software engineering tasks and corresponding test suites. These approaches face two key limitations: (1) their reliance on pre-existing GitHub repositories offers limited flexibility, and (2) their primary focus on issue resolution tasks restricts their applicability to the much wider variety of tasks a software engineer must handle. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SWE-Playground, a novel pipeline for generating environments and trajectories which supports the training of versatile coding agents. Unlike prior efforts, SWE-Playground synthetically generates projects and tasks from scratch with strong language models and agents, eliminating reliance on external data sources. This allows us to tackle a much wider variety of coding tasks, such as reproducing issues by generating unit tests and implementing libraries from scratch. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on three distinct benchmarks, and results indicate that SWE-Playground produces trajectories with dense training signal, enabling agents to reach comparable performance with significantly fewer trajectories than previous works.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented vision language models (VLMs) generate explicit chains of thought that promise greater capability and transparency but also introduce new failure modes: models may reach correct answers via visually unfaithful intermediate steps, or reason faithfully yet fail on the final prediction. Standard evaluations that only measure final-answer accuracy cannot distinguish these behaviors. We introduce the visual faithfulness of reasoning chains as a distinct evaluation dimension, focusing on whether the perception steps of a reasoning chain are grounded in the image. We propose a training- and reference-free framework that decomposes chains into perception versus reasoning steps and uses off-the-shelf VLM judges for step-level faithfulness, additionally verifying this approach through a human meta-evaluation. Building on this metric, we present a lightweight self-reflection procedure that detects and locally regenerates unfaithful perception steps without any training. Across multiple reasoning-trained VLMs and perception-heavy benchmarks, our method reduces Unfaithful Perception Rate while preserving final-answer accuracy, improving the reliability of multimodal reasoning.

<title>From Human Intention to Action Prediction: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Intention-driven End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Current end-to-end autonomous driving systems operate at a level of intelligence akin to following simple steering commands. However, achieving genuinely intelligent autonomy requires a paradigm shift: moving from merely executing low-level instructions to understanding and fulfilling high-level, abstract human intentions. This leap from a command-follower to an intention-fulfiller, as illustrated in our conceptual framework, is hindered by a fundamental challenge: the absence of a standardized benchmark to measure and drive progress on this complex task. To address this critical gap, we introduce Intention-Drive, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the ability to translate high-level human intent into safe and precise driving actions. Intention-Drive features two core contributions: (1) a new dataset of complex scenarios paired with corresponding natural language intentions, and (2) a novel evaluation protocol centered on the Intent Success Rate (ISR), which assesses the semantic fulfillment of the human's goal beyond simple geometric accuracy. Through an extensive evaluation of a spectrum of baseline models on Intention-Drive, we reveal a significant performance deficit, showing that the baseline model struggle to achieve the comprehensive scene and intention understanding required for this advanced task.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains challenging due to the extended temporal structure and dense multimodal cues. Despite recent progress, many existing approaches still rely on hand-crafted reasoning pipelines or employ token-consuming video preprocessing to guide MLLMs in autonomous reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VideoARM, an Agentic Reasoning-over-hierarchical-Memory paradigm for long-form video understanding. Instead of static, exhaustive preprocessing, VideoARM performs adaptive, on-the-fly agentic reasoning and memory construction. Specifically, VideoARM performs an adaptive and continuous loop of observing, thinking, acting, and memorizing, where a controller autonomously invokes tools to interpret the video in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby substantially reducing token consumption. In parallel, a hierarchical multimodal memory continuously captures and updates multi-level clues throughout the operation of the agent, providing precise contextual information to support the controller in decision-making. Experiments on prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that VideoARM outperforms the state-of-the-art method, DVD, while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form videos.

Abstract: Domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) offers a practical path to specializing large language models for high-value domains without full retraining. We conduct an early-stage scaling-law analysis of continued pretraining on U.S. SEC filings, training 1B and 3B-parameter Llama-3.2 models on a 400M-token financial corpus with validation checkpoints at 50M, 100M, 200M, and 400M tokens. Results show consistent improvements in SEC-domain validation loss for both models, with the largest gains occurring within the first 200M tokens and diminishing returns thereafter. Power-law fits reveal shallow exponents, indicating that financial language is highly regular and efficiently learnable under continued pretraining. General-domain validation loss remains effectively unchanged across all token budgets, suggesting minimal drift and no signs of catastrophic forgetting. A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation. Together, these findings provide early empirical guidance for scaling financial foundation models, suggesting that meaningful domain adaptation can be achieved with comparatively modest token budgets and that larger model scales (7B-70B) remain tractable under projected data requirements.

Abstract: We present a simple structure based model of how words are formed from morphemes. The model explains two major empirical facts: the typical distribution of word lengths and the appearance of Zipf like rank frequency curves. In contrast to classical explanations based on random text or communication efficiency, our approach uses only the combinatorial organization of prefixes, roots, suffixes and inflections. In this Morphemic Combinatorial Word Model, a word is created by activating several positional slots. Each slot turns on with a certain probability and selects one morpheme from its inventory. Morphemes are treated as stable building blocks that regularly appear in word formation and have characteristic positions. This mechanism produces realistic word length patterns with a concentrated middle zone and a thin long tail, closely matching real languages. Simulations with synthetic morpheme inventories also generate rank frequency curves with Zipf like exponents around 1.1-1.4, similar to English, Russian and Romance languages. The key result is that Zipf like behavior can emerge without meaning, communication pressure or optimization principles. The internal structure of morphology alone, combined with probabilistic activation of slots, is sufficient to create the robust statistical patterns observed across languages.

Abstract: Polyp detectors trained on clean datasets often underperform in real-world endoscopy, where illumination changes, motion blur, and occlusions degrade image quality. Existing approaches struggle with the domain gap between controlled laboratory conditions and clinical practice, where adverse imaging conditions are prevalent. In this work, we propose AdaptiveDetector, a novel two-stage detector-verifier framework comprising a YOLOv11 detector with a vision-language model (VLM) verifier. The detector adaptively adjusts per-frame confidence thresholds under VLM guidance, while the verifier is fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using an asymmetric, cost-sensitive reward function specifically designed to discourage missed detections -- a critical clinical requirement. To enable realistic assessment under challenging conditions, we construct a comprehensive synthetic testbed by systematically degrading clean datasets with adverse conditions commonly encountered in clinical practice, providing a rigorous benchmark for zero-shot evaluation. Extensive zero-shot evaluation on synthetically degraded CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG images demonstrates that our approach improves recall by 14 to 22 percentage points over YOLO alone, while precision remains within 0.7 points below to 1.7 points above the baseline. This combination of adaptive thresholding and cost-sensitive reinforcement learning achieves clinically aligned, open-world polyp detection with substantially fewer false negatives, thereby reducing the risk of missed precancerous polyps and improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: LLM agents that use external tools can solve complex tasks, but understanding which tools actually contributed to a response remains a blind spot. No existing XAI methods address tool-level explanations. We introduce AgentSHAP, the first framework for explaining tool importance in LLM agents. AgentSHAP is model-agnostic: it treats the agent as a black box and works with any LLM (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.) without needing access to internal weights or gradients. Using Monte Carlo Shapley values, AgentSHAP tests how an agent responds with different tool subsets and computes fair importance scores based on game theory. Our contributions are: (1) the first explainability method for agent tool attribution, grounded in Shapley values from game theory; (2) Monte Carlo sampling that reduces cost from O(2n) to practical levels; and (3) comprehensive experiments on API-Bank showing that AgentSHAP produces consistent scores across runs, correctly identifies which tools matter, and distinguishes relevant from irrelevant tools. AgentSHAP joins TokenSHAP (for tokens) and PixelSHAP (for image regions) to complete a family of Shapley-based XAI tools for modern generative AI. Code: https://github.com/GenAISHAP/TokenSHAP.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced cross-modal understanding and reasoning by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the semantic space. Building upon this, recent studies extend the CoT mechanism to the visual modality, enabling models to integrate visual information during reasoning through external tools or explicit image generation. However, these methods remain dependent on explicit step-by-step reasoning, unstable perception-reasoning interaction and notable computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition, we posit that thinking unfolds not linearly but through the dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception within the mind. Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving. Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures demonstrate that DMLR significantly improves reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Abstract: Agentic memory is emerging as a key enabler for large language models (LLM) to maintain continuity, personalization, and long-term context in extended user interactions, critical capabilities for deploying LLMs as truly interactive and adaptive agents. Agentic memory refers to the memory that provides an LLM with agent-like persistence: the ability to retain and act upon information across conversations, similar to how a human would. We present Memoria, a modular memory framework that augments LLM-based conversational systems with persistent, interpretable, and context-rich memory. Memoria integrates two complementary components: dynamic session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph (KG)-based user modelling engine that incrementally captures user traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns as structured entities and relationships. This hybrid architecture enables both short-term dialogue coherence and long-term personalization while operating within the token constraints of modern LLMs. We demonstrate how Memoria enables scalable, personalized conversational artificial intelligence (AI) by bridging the gap between stateless LLM interfaces and agentic memory systems, offering a practical solution for industry applications requiring adaptive and evolving user experiences.

Abstract: Prompts can switch a model's behavior even when the weights are fixed, yet this phenomenon is rarely treated as a clean theoretical object rather than a heuristic. We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs.

<title>Reassessing the Role of Supervised Fine-Tuning: An Empirical Study in VLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) reasoning have been largely attributed to the rise of reinforcement Learning (RL), which has shifted the community's focus away from the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. Many studies suggest that introducing the SFT stage not only fails to improve reasoning ability but may also negatively impact model training. In this study, we revisit this RL-centric belief through a systematic and controlled comparison of SFT and RL on VLM Reasoning. Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities. Moreover, we identify a pervasive issue of deceptive rewards, where higher rewards fail to correlate with better reasoning accuracy in RL. These results challenge the prevailing "RL over SFT" narrative. They highlight that the role of SFT may have been underestimated and support a more balanced post-training pipeline in which SFT and RL function as complementary components.

<title>WebOperator: Action-Aware Tree Search for Autonomous Agents in Web Environment</title>

Abstract: LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution.

<title>Efficient Vision-Language Reasoning via Adaptive Token Pruning</title>

Abstract: Real-world deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is hindered by high computational demands, as existing architectures inefficiently process all tokens uniformly. We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance. ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines.

Abstract: The rapid acceleration of scientific publishing has created substantial challenges for researchers attempting to discover, contextualize, and interpret relevant literature. Traditional keyword-based search systems provide limited semantic understanding, while existing AI-driven tools typically focus on isolated tasks such as retrieval, clustering, or bibliometric visualization. This paper presents an integrated system for scientific literature exploration that combines large-scale data acquisition, hybrid retrieval, semantic topic modeling, and heterogeneous knowledge graph construction. The system builds a comprehensive corpus by merging full-text data from arXiv with structured metadata from OpenAlex. A hybrid retrieval architecture fuses BM25 lexical search with embedding-based semantic search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Topic modeling is performed on retrieved results using BERTopic or non-negative matrix factorization depending on computational resources. A knowledge graph unifies papers, authors, institutions, countries, and extracted topics into an interpretable structure. The system provides a multi-layered exploration environment that reveals not only relevant publications but also the conceptual and relational landscape surrounding a query. Evaluation across multiple queries demonstrates improvements in retrieval relevance, topic coherence, and interpretability. The proposed framework contributes an extensible foundation for AI-assisted scientific discovery.

Abstract: Valuing intangible assets under uncertainty remains a critical challenge in the strategic management of technological innovation due to the information asymmetry inherent in high-dimensional technical specifications. Traditional bibliometric indicators, such as citation counts, fail to address this friction in a timely manner due to the systemic latency inherent in data accumulation. To bridge this gap, this study proposes the Economic Reasoning Alignment via Instruction Tuning (ERA-IT) framework. We theoretically conceptualize patent renewal history as a revealed economic preference and leverage it as an objective supervisory signal to align the generative reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with market realities, a process we term Eco-Semantic Alignment. Using a randomly sampled dataset of 10,000 European Patent Office patents across diverse technological domains, we trained the model not only to predict value tiers but also to reverse-engineer the Economic Chain-of-Thought from unstructured text. Empirical results demonstrate that ERA-IT significantly outperforms both conventional econometric models and zero-shot LLMs in predictive accuracy. More importantly, by generating explicit, logically grounded rationales for valuation, the framework serves as a transparent cognitive scaffold for decision-makers, reducing the opacity of black-box AI in high-stakes intellectual property management.

Abstract: Automated road sign recognition is a critical task for intelligent transportation systems, but traditional deep learning methods struggle with the sheer number of sign classes and the impracticality of creating exhaustive labeled datasets. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot recognition framework that adapts the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm to address this challenge. Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving 95.58% accuracy on ideal reference images and 82.45% on challenging real-world road data. This work demonstrates the viability of RAG-based architectures for creating scalable and accurate systems for road sign recognition without task-specific training.

Abstract: Advancing artificial intelligence for physical sciences requires representations that are both interpretable and compatible with the underlying laws of nature. We introduce METASTRINGS, a symbolic language for photonics that expresses nanostructures as textual sequences encoding materials, geometries, and lattice configurations. Analogous to molecular textual representations in chemistry, METASTRINGS provides a framework connecting human interpretability with computational design by capturing the structural hierarchy of photonic metasurfaces. Building on this representation, we develop Meta-GPT, a foundation transformer model trained on METASTRINGS and finetuned with physics-informed supervised, reinforcement, and chain-of-thought learning. Across various design tasks, the model achieves <3% mean-squared spectral error and maintains >98% syntactic validity, generating diverse metasurface prototypes whose experimentally measured optical responses match their target spectra. These results demonstrate that Meta-GPT can learn the compositional rules of light-matter interactions through METASTRINGS, laying a rigorous foundation for AI-driven photonics and representing an important step toward a metasurface genome project.

Abstract: The canonical $O(N^2)$ Transformer remains the empirical performance frontier in sequence modeling, and its training can be further optimized by addressing geometric inefficiency. We propose an optimization framework that leverages an asymmetric projection to decompose the backward-pass gradients into parallel spans and orthogonal violations, while keeping the canonical forward-pass $QKV$ structure intact. Through consistent experimental validation across various decomposition and projection setups, we provide strong theoretical evidence: the standard attention gradient is suboptimal. We demonstrated that selectively scaling these components, focusing primarily on $0^{th}$ order bidirectional parallel spans, yields the most effective learning signal. On the limited WikiText-2 dataset, and using a crude configuration, this method achieved a $0.56\%$ reduction in validation loss, confirming the framework's fundamental validity and suggesting significant potential gains on larger datasets and deeper training regimes

<title>Understanding Structured Financial Data with LLMs: A Case Study on Fraud Detection</title>

Abstract: Detecting fraud in financial transactions typically relies on tabular models that demand heavy feature engineering to handle high-dimensional data and offer limited interpretability, making it difficult for humans to understand predictions. Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can produce human-readable explanations and facilitate feature analysis, potentially reducing the manual workload of fraud analysts and informing system refinements. However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings. Although these LLMs still lag behind specialized classifiers, they narrow the performance gap and provide interpretable rationales, highlighting their value as assistive tools in fraud analysis.

<title>M-GRPO: Stabilizing Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models with Momentum-Anchored Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL) presents a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without reliance on expensive human-annotated data. However, we find that existing methods suffer from a critical failure mode under long-horizon training: a "policy collapse" where performance precipitously degrades. We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This study provides an overview of heart disease prediction using an intelligent system. Predicting disease accurately is crucial in the medical field, but traditional methods relying solely on a doctor's experience often lack precision. To address this limitation, intelligent systems are applied as an alternative to traditional approaches. While various intelligent system methods exist, this study focuses on three: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). A comparison of these techniques in terms of accuracy was conducted, and ultimately, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) was selected for heart disease prediction. In the prediction phase, the heart disease dataset underwent data pre-processing to clean the data and data splitting to separate it into training and testing sets. The chosen intelligent system was then employed to predict heart disease outcomes based on the processed data. The experiment concluded with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) achieving a notable accuracy rate of 97.95% in predicting heart disease. The findings also revealed that the probability of heart disease was 57.76% for males and 42.24% for females. Further analysis from related studies suggests that factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption are significant contributors to heart disease, particularly among males.

<title>MAC: A Multi-Agent Framework for Interactive User Clarification in Multi-turn Conversations</title>

Abstract: Conversational agents often encounter ambiguous user requests, requiring an effective clarification to successfully complete tasks. While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition. Our findings highlight the importance of active user interaction and role-aware clarification for more reliable human-agent communication.

Abstract: Effective human-agent collaboration is increasingly prevalent in real-world applications. Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to memorizing training data, which poses serious privacy risks. Two of the most prominent concerns are training data extraction and Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). Prior research has shown that these threats are interconnected: adversaries can extract training data from an LLM by querying the model to generate a large volume of text and subsequently applying MIAs to verify whether a particular data point was included in the training set. In this study, we integrate multiple MIA techniques into the data extraction pipeline to systematically benchmark their effectiveness. We then compare their performance in this integrated setting against results from conventional MIA benchmarks, allowing us to evaluate their practical utility in real-world extraction scenarios.

Abstract: The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the "meta-gradient" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention.

Abstract: Envy is a common human behavior that shapes competitiveness and can alter outcomes in team settings. As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains. These results highlight the need to consider competitive dispositions as a safety and design factor in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: An increasing variety of AI accelerators is being considered for large-scale training. However, enabling large-scale training on early-life AI accelerators faces three core challenges: frequent system disruptions and undefined failure modes that undermine reliability; numerical errors and training instabilities that threaten correctness and convergence; and the complexity of parallelism optimization combined with unpredictable local noise that degrades efficiency. To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators. This effort delivered remarkable stability and efficiency outcomes, achieving 21.08% MFU, state-of-the-art downstream accuracy, and encountering only one stability incident over a 75-day period. Together, these advances establish SIGMA, which not only tackles the critical challenges of large-scale training but also establishes a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and platform innovation, offering a robust, cost-effective alternative to prevailing established accelerator stacks and significantly advancing AI capabilities and scalability. The source code of SIGMA is available at https://github.com/microsoft/LuciaTrainingPlatform.

Abstract: The study presents the outcomes of research and experimental validation in the domain of automated codebase migration, with a focus on addressing challenges in transitioning SQL-based systems. The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement.

Abstract: We introduce Interactive Intelligence, a novel paradigm of digital human that is capable of personality-aligned expression, adaptive interaction, and self-evolution. To realize this, we present Mio (Multimodal Interactive Omni-Avatar), an end-to-end framework composed of five specialized modules: Thinker, Talker, Face Animator, Body Animator, and Renderer. This unified architecture integrates cognitive reasoning with real-time multimodal embodiment to enable fluid, consistent interaction. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of interactive intelligence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated dimensions. Together, these contributions move digital humans beyond superficial imitation toward intelligent interaction.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have seen considerable advancements and have been applied in diverse fields. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models are trained on extensive datasets, enabling them to understand and generate human language effectively. In the financial domain, the deployment of LLMs is gaining momentum. These models are being utilized for automating financial report generation, forecasting market trends, analyzing investor sentiment, and offering personalized financial advice. Leveraging their natural language processing capabilities, LLMs can distill key insights from vast financial data, aiding institutions in making informed investment choices and enhancing both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. In this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging integration of LLMs into various financial tasks. Additionally, we conducted holistic tests on multiple financial tasks through the combination of natural language instructions. Our findings show that GPT-4 effectively follow prompt instructions across various financial tasks. This survey and evaluation of LLMs in the financial domain aim to deepen the understanding of LLMs' current role in finance for both financial practitioners and LLM researchers, identify new research and application prospects, and highlight how these technologies can be leveraged to solve practical challenges in the finance industry.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in business processes is crucial for ensuring operational success. While many existing methods rely on statistical frequency to detect anomalies, it's important to note that infrequent behavior doesn't necessarily imply undesirability. To address this challenge, detecting anomalies from a semantic viewpoint proves to be a more effective approach. However, current semantic anomaly detection methods treat a trace (i.e., process instance) as multiple event pairs, disrupting long-distance dependencies. In this paper, we introduce DABL, a novel approach for detecting semantic anomalies in business processes using large language models (LLMs). We collect 143,137 real-world process models from various domains. By generating normal traces through the playout of these process models and simulating both ordering and exclusion anomalies, we fine-tune Llama 2 using the resulting log. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DABL surpasses existing state-of-the-art semantic anomaly detection methods in terms of both generalization ability and learning of given processes. Users can directly apply DABL to detect semantic anomalies in their own datasets without the need for additional training. Furthermore, DABL offers the capability to interpret the causes of anomalies in natural language, providing valuable insights into the detected anomalies.

<title>Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Contrasting Safe and Harmful Distributions</title>

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates, limiting the degree of contrast. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite soft system prompts, the Safeguarding Prompt (SP) and the Adversarial Prompt (AP), for prompt-based contrastive decoding. The SP aims to promote safer outputs while the AP aims to exploit the harmful parts of the model, providing a strong contrast to align the model with safety. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.

Abstract: When prompted to think step-by-step, language models (LMs) produce a chain of thought (CoT), a sequence of reasoning steps that the model supposedly used to produce its prediction. Despite much work on CoT prompting, it is unclear if reasoning verbalized in a CoT is faithful to the models' parametric beliefs. We introduce a framework for measuring parametric faithfulness of generated reasoning, and propose Faithfulness by Unlearning Reasoning steps (FUR), an instance of this framework. FUR erases information contained in reasoning steps from model parameters, and measures faithfulness as the resulting effect on the model's prediction. Our experiments with four LMs and five multi-hop multi-choice question answering (MCQA) datasets show that FUR is frequently able to precisely change the underlying models' prediction for a given instance by unlearning key steps, indicating when a CoT is parametrically faithful. Further analysis shows that CoTs generated by models post-unlearning support different answers, hinting at a deeper effect of unlearning.

Abstract: This article presents experiments performed using a computational laboratory environment for language acquisition experiments. It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.

Abstract: Fine-tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to specific domains, but often compromises their previously established safety alignment. To mitigate the degradation of model safety during fine-tuning, we introduce LookAhead Tuning, a lightweight and effective data-driven approach that preserves safety during fine-tuning. The method introduces two simple strategies that modify training data by previewing partial answer prefixes, thereby minimizing perturbations to the model's initial token distributions and maintaining its built-in safety mechanisms. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LookAhead Tuning effectively maintains model safety without sacrificing robust performance on downstream tasks. Our findings position LookAhead Tuning as a reliable and efficient solution for the safe and effective adaptation of LLMs.

<title>Do LLM Evaluators Prefer Themselves for a Reason?</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic evaluators in applications such as benchmarking, reward modeling, and self-refinement. Prior work highlights a potential self-preference bias where LLMs favor their own generated responses, a tendency often intensifying with model size and capability. This raises a critical question: Is self-preference harmful, or does it simply reflect the genuinely higher-quality outputs of stronger models? Answering this has been difficult as prior works mostly relied on subjective tasks that lack an objective ground truth, meaning that either preference can be reasonably justified. To address this ambiguity, we investigate self-preference using verifiable benchmarks (mathematical reasoning, factual knowledge, code generation) that allow objective ground-truth assessment. This enables us to distinguish harmful (favoring objectively worse responses) from legitimate (favoring genuinely superior ones) self-preference. Our large-scale experiments across 7 model families reveal three key findings: (1) While stronger models exhibit greater self-preference, much of this preference aligns with objectively superior performance, indicating stronger models prefer themselves mostly legitimately. (2) Harmful self-preference persists when evaluator models err as generators, and stronger models display more pronounced harmful self-preference bias when they do err. This suggests stronger models struggle more to recognize when they are wrong. (3) Inference-time scaling strategies, such as generating a long Chain-of-Thought before evaluation, effectively reduce the harmful self-preference. Additionally, we experiment with LMArena and show that our findings extend beyond verifiable benchmarks to real-world, subjective domains. These results provide a more nuanced understanding of LLM-based evaluation and practical insights for improving its reliability.

Abstract: Span annotation - annotating specific text features at the span level - can be used to evaluate texts where single-score metrics fail to provide actionable feedback. Until recently, span annotation was done by human annotators or fine-tuned models. In this paper, we study whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as an alternative to human annotators. We compare the abilities of LLMs to skilled human annotators on three span annotation tasks: evaluating data-to-text generation, identifying translation errors, and detecting propaganda techniques. We show that overall, LLMs have only moderate inter-annotator agreement (IAA) with human annotators. However, we demonstrate that LLMs make errors at a similar rate as skilled crowdworkers. LLMs also produce annotations at a fraction of the cost per output annotation. We release the dataset of over 40k model and human span annotations for further research.

<title>Relation Extraction or Pattern Matching? Unravelling the Generalisation Limits of Language Models for Biographical RE</title>

Abstract: Analysing the generalisation capabilities of relation extraction (RE) models is crucial for assessing whether they learn robust relational patterns or rely on spurious correlations. Our cross-dataset experiments find that RE models struggle with unseen data, even within similar domains. Notably, higher intra-dataset performance does not indicate better transferability, instead often signaling overfitting to dataset-specific artefacts. Our results also show that data quality, rather than lexical similarity, is key to robust transfer, and the choice of optimal adaptation strategy depends on the quality of data available: while fine-tuning yields the best cross-dataset performance with high-quality data, few-shot in-context learning (ICL) is more effective with noisier data. However, even in these cases, zero-shot baselines occasionally outperform all cross-dataset results. Structural issues in RE benchmarks, such as single-relation per sample constraints and non-standardised negative class definitions, further hinder model transferability.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to autonomously explore and comprehend the environment to answer context-dependent questions. Typically, an EQA framework consists of four components: a planner, a memory module, a stopping module, and an answering module. However, the memory module is utilized inefficiently in existing methods, as the information it stores is leveraged solely for the answering module. Such a design may result in redundant or inadequate exploration, leading to a suboptimal success rate. To solve this problem, we propose MemoryEQA, an EQA framework centered on memory, which establishes mechanisms for memory storage, update, and retrieval, allowing memory information to contribute throughout the entire exploration process. Specifically, we convert the observation into structured textual representations, which are stored in a vector library following a fixed structure. At each exploration step, we utilize a viewpoint comparison strategy to determine whether the memory requires updating. Before executing each module, we employ an entropy-based adaptive retrieval strategy to obtain the minimal yet sufficient memory information that satisfies the requirements of different modules. The retrieved module-specific information is then integrated with the current observation as input to the corresponding module. To evaluate EQA models' memory capabilities, we constructed the benchmark based on HM3D called MT-HM3D, comprising 1,587 question-answer pairs involving multiple targets across various regions, which requires agents to maintain memory of exploration-acquired target information. Experimental results on HM-EQA, MT-HM3D, and OpenEQA demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, where a 9.9% performance gain on MT-HM3D compared to baseline models further underscores the memory capability's pivotal role in solving complex tasks.

<title>Leveraging Importance Sampling to Detach Alignment Modules from Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has increased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However, traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models, making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline models.

Abstract: Images usually convey richer detail than text, but often include redundant information, which potentially downgrades multimodal reasoning performance. When faced with lengthy or complex messages, humans tend to employ abstract thinking to convert them into simple and concise abstracts. Inspired by this cognitive strategy, we introduce a novel paradigm to elicit the ability to Think with Visual Abstract (VAT), by prompting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual abstract instead of explicit verbal thoughts or elaborate guidance, permitting a more efficient visual reasoning mechanism via concentrated perception. VAT encourages models to focus on more essential visual elements, concepts and structural features by undermining redundant information compared with explicit thinking methods, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT) and tool-using approaches, that increase the complexity of reasoning process via inserting verbose intermediate steps and external knowledge. Experimental results show that VAT consistently empowers different MLLMs in visual perception and reasoning tasks. VAT achieves an average gain of $2.21\%$ over GPT-5 baseline, surpassing the gain of CoT, demonstrating that VAT better enhances multimodal task performance of MLLMs. Additionally, VAT spends fewer tokens while achieving higher performance. These findings highlight the effectiveness of visual abstract thinking and encourage further exploration of more diverse reasoning paradigms from the perspective of human cognition.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of visual and textual content in Social Networking Services (SNS), evaluating the multimodal capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing user experience, content understanding, and platform intelligence. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on text-centric tasks, lacking coverage of the multimodal contexts prevalent in modern SNS ecosystems. In this paper, we introduce SNS-Bench-VL, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to assess the performance of Vision-Language LLMs in real-world social media scenarios. SNS-Bench-VL incorporates images and text across 8 multimodal tasks, including note comprehension, user engagement analysis, information retrieval, and personalized recommendation. It comprises 4,001 carefully curated multimodal question-answer pairs, covering single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended tasks. We evaluate over 25 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, analyzing their performance across tasks. Our findings highlight persistent challenges in multimodal social context comprehension. We hope SNS-Bench-VL will inspire future research towards robust, context-aware, and human-aligned multimodal intelligence for next-generation social networking services.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in translation among other things, demonstrating competitive performance for many language pairs in zero- and few-shot settings. But unlike dedicated neural machine translation models, LLMs are not trained on any translation-related objective. What explains their remarkable translation abilities? Are these abilities grounded in "incidental bilingualism" (Briakou et al. 2023) in training data? Does instruction tuning contribute to it? Are LLMs capable of aligning and leveraging semantically identical or similar monolingual contents from different corners of the internet that are unlikely to fit in a single context window? I offer some reflections on this topic, informed by recent studies and growing user experience. My working hypothesis is that LLMs' translation abilities originate in two different types of pre-training data that may be internalized by the models in different ways. I discuss the prospects for testing the "duality" hypothesis empirically and its implications for reconceptualizing translation, human and machine, in the age of deep learning.

Abstract: Visualizations play a crucial part in effective communication of concepts and information. Recent advances in reasoning and retrieval augmented generation have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deep research and generate comprehensive reports. Despite its progress, existing deep research frameworks primarily focus on generating text-only content, leaving the automated generation of interleaved texts and visualizations underexplored. This novel task poses key challenges in designing informative visualizations and effectively integrating them with text reports. To address these challenges, we propose Formal Description of Visualization (FDV), a structured textual representation of charts that enables LLMs to learn from and generate diverse, high-quality visualizations. Building on this representation, we introduce Multimodal DeepResearcher, an agentic framework that decomposes the task into four stages: (1) researching, (2) exemplar report textualization, (3) planning, and (4) multimodal report generation. For the evaluation of generated multimodal reports, we develop MultimodalReportBench, which contains 100 diverse topics served as inputs along with 5 dedicated metrics. Extensive experiments across models and evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness of Multimodal DeepResearcher. Notably, utilizing the same Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, Multimodal DeepResearcher achieves an 82% overall win rate over the baseline method.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to the public, with limited information about their construction process. This lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects, and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent increases in model scale.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an increasing need for challenging benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities in handling complex tabular data. However, existing benchmarks are either based on outdated data setups or focus solely on simple, flat table structures. In this paper, we introduce RealHiTBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of both LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) across a variety of input formats for complex tabular data, including LaTeX, HTML, and PNG. RealHiTBench also includes a diverse collection of tables with intricate structures, spanning a wide range of task types. Our experimental results, using 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrate that RealHiTBench is indeed a challenging benchmark. Moreover, we also develop TreeThinker, a tree-based pipeline that organizes hierarchical headers into a tree structure for enhanced tabular reasoning, validating the importance of improving LLMs' perception of table hierarchies. We hope that our work will inspire further research on tabular data reasoning and the development of more robust models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/cspzyy/RealHiTBench.

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions. However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi, covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language generation (NLG), yet their internal mechanisms for synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap, we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers, reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift, models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on intermediate layers, highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness. Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a new perspective to study AI safety.

Abstract: The concept of diversity has received increased consideration in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. This is due to various motivations like promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and increasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in an ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where this notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from the past 6 years, with "diversity" or "diverse" in their title. We find a wide range of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized and using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why, what on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are cast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3 dimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends which emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study paves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should bring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between various approaches.

<title>Decoupling Understanding from Reasoning via Problem Space Mapping for Small-Scale Model Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs, e.g., up to 1.5B parameters) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization, particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective strategy for strengthening SLMs.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in applications targeting children and adolescents necessitates a fundamental reassessment of prevailing AI safety frameworks, which are largely tailored to adult users and neglect the distinct developmental vulnerabilities of minors. This paper highlights key deficiencies in existing LLM safety benchmarks, including their inadequate coverage of age-specific cognitive, emotional, and social risks spanning early childhood (ages 0--6), middle childhood (7--12), and adolescence (13--18). To bridge these gaps, we introduce SproutBench, an innovative evaluation suite comprising 1,283 developmentally grounded adversarial prompts designed to probe risks such as emotional dependency, privacy violations, and imitation of hazardous behaviors. Through rigorous empirical evaluation of 47 diverse LLMs, we uncover substantial safety vulnerabilities, corroborated by robust inter-dimensional correlations (e.g., between Safety and Risk Prevention) and a notable inverse relationship between Interactivity and Age Appropriateness. These insights yield practical guidelines for advancing child-centric AI design and deployment.

Abstract: In August 2025, OpenAI released GPT-OSS models, its first open weight large language models since GPT-2 in 2019, comprising two mixture of experts architectures with 120B and 20B parameters. We evaluated both variants against six contemporary open source large language models ranging from 14.7B to 235B parameters, representing both dense and sparse designs, across ten benchmarks covering general knowledge, mathematical reasoning, code generation, multilingual understanding, and conversational ability. All models were tested in unquantised form under standardised inference settings, with statistical validation using McNemars test and effect size analysis. Results show that gpt-oss-20B consistently outperforms gpt-oss-120B on several benchmarks, such as HumanEval and MMLU, despite requiring substantially less memory and energy per response. Both models demonstrate mid-tier overall performance within the current open source landscape, with relative strength in code generation and notable weaknesses in multilingual tasks. These findings provide empirical evidence that scaling in sparse architectures may not yield proportional performance gains, underscoring the need for further investigation into optimisation strategies and informing more efficient model selection for future open source deployments. More details and evaluation scripts are available at https://ai-agent-lab.github.io/gpt-oss (Project Webpage).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cultural bias from overrepresented viewpoints in training data, yet cultural alignment remains a challenge due to limited cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient and cognitively grounded method: fine-tuning LLMs on native speakers' word-association norms, leveraging cognitive psychology findings that such associations capture cultural knowledge. Using word association datasets from native speakers in the US (English) and China (Mandarin), we train Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization. We evaluate models' cultural alignment through a two-tier evaluation framework that spans lexical associations and cultural value alignment using the World Values Survey. Results show significant improvements in lexical alignment (16-20% English, 43-165% Mandarin on Precision@5) and high-level cultural value shifts. On a subset of 50 questions where US and Chinese respondents diverge most, fine-tuned Qwen nearly doubles its response alignment with Chinese values (13 to 25). Remarkably, our trained 7-8B models match or exceed vanilla 70B baselines, demonstrating that a few million of culture-grounded associations achieve value alignment without expensive retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations, we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS) strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks, as well as on code generation tasks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of SvS.

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications. However, their safety remains a concern due to the existence of various jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful content. This leaves them prone to a range of vulnerabilities, including targeted misuse and accidental user profiling. This work introduces \textbf{ConceptGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal representations, ConceptGuard enables building robust safety guardrails -- offering fully explainable and generalizable defenses without sacrificing model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach provides evidence for a shared activation geometry for jailbreak attacks in the representation space, a potential foundation for designing more interpretable and generalizable safeguards against attackers.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we propose GRADE, a novel evaluation framework that models task difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty. Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility. GRADE enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when handling non-annotated charts. We argue that current MLLMs rely largely on visual recognition rather than visual reasoning to interpret the charts, and visual estimation of numerical values is one of the most fundamental capabilities in chart understanding that require complex visual reasoning. To prove this, we introduce ChartVRBench, a benchmark meticulously designed to isolate and evaluate visual reasoning ability in chart understanding. Furthermore, we propose ChartVR-3B/7B trained with a novel Visual Reasoning Reinforcement Finetuning (VR-RFT) strategy to strengthen genuine chart visual reasoning abilities. Extensive experiments show that ChartVR achieves superior performance on ChartVRBench, outperforming even powerful proprietary models. Moreover, the visual reasoning skills cultivated by the proposed VR-RFT demonstrate strong generalization, leading to significant performance gains across a diverse suite of public chart understanding benchmarks. The code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a pruning method that is highly integrated with PD disaggregation, enabling more precise pruning of blocks. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we analyze the pruning sensitivity of the prefill and decode stages and identify removable blocks specific to each stage, making it well suited for PD disaggregation deployment. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified (non-PD disaggregation) settings, and can also be extended to other non-block pruning methods. Under the same settings, our method achieves improved performance and faster inference.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs, they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a single model.

Abstract: We introduce Synthetic Bootstrapped Pretraining (SBP), a language model (LM) pretraining procedure that first learns a model of relations between documents from the pretraining dataset and then leverages it to synthesize a vast new corpus for joint training. While the standard pretraining teaches LMs to learn causal correlations among tokens within a single document, it is not designed to efficiently model the rich, learnable inter-document correlations that can potentially lead to better performance. We validate SBP by designing a compute-matched pretraining setup and pretrain a 3B-parameter and a 6B-parameter model on up to 1T tokens from scratch. We find SBP consistently improves upon a strong repetition baseline and delivers up to 60% of performance improvement attainable by an oracle upper bound with access to 20x more unique data. Qualitative analysis reveals that the synthesized documents go beyond mere paraphrases -- SBP first abstracts a core concept from the seed material and then crafts a new narration on top of it. Besides strong empirical performance, SBP admits a natural Bayesian interpretation: the synthesizer implicitly learns to abstract the latent concepts shared between related documents.

Abstract: A repeated claim in linguistics is that the majority of linguistic utterances are unique. For example, Pinker (1994: 10), summarizing an argument by Noam Chomsky, states that "virtually every sentence that a person utters or understands is a brand-new combination of words, appearing for the first time in the history of the universe." With the increased availability of large corpora, this is a claim that can be empirically investigated. The current paper addresses the question by using the NLTK Python library to parse corpora of different genres, providing counts of exact string matches in each. Results show that while completely unique sentences are often the majority of corpora, this is highly constrained by genre, and that duplicate sentences are not an insignificant part of any individual corpus.

Abstract: Merging methods combine the weights of multiple language models (LMs) to leverage their capacities, such as for domain adaptation. While existing studies investigate merged models from a solely behavioral perspective, we offer the first comprehensive view by assessing and connecting their behavior and internals. We present a novel evaluation pipeline that first merges multiple parent LMs, and then evaluates the merged models in comparison to the initial ones based on their behavior on downstream tasks, like MMLU, and the internal encoded linguistic competence. We showcase this pipeline by assessing the merging of instruction fine-tuned with math- and code-adapted LMs from the Qwen2.5 family. Our results show that merging methods impacts behavior and internals differently. While the performance of merged models is typically between that of the two parent models, their encoded information about linguistic phenomena, particularly in morphology and syntax, can surpass the parent models. Moreover, we find weak ranking correlation between this behavior and internal evaluation. With our pipeline and initial results, we emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluations of model merging methods to gain a faithful understanding of their capabilities and reliability, beyond potential superficial behavioral advances.

Abstract: We present a scientific reasoning foundation model that aligns natural language with heterogeneous scientific representations. The model is pretrained on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction, (iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline learning strengthens transfer and downstream reliability. The model, instruct tuning datasets and the evaluation code are open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/SciReason and https://github.com/open-sciencelab/SciReason.

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings, and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2) collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining 5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete instructions. Further experiments show that OpenAI-o3 are more resilient to output formats than general-purpose GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, highlighting an unaware advantage of reasoning models.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts (system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g., pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance (e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

<title>Beyond Magic Words: Sharpness-Aware Prompt Evolving for Robust Large Language Models with TARE</title>

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search, primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete, semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while remaining computationally practical.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Visual RAG) significantly advances question answering by integrating visual and textual evidence. Yet, current evaluations fail to systematically account for query difficulty and ambiguity. We propose MRAG-Suite, a diagnostic evaluation platform integrating diverse multimodal benchmarks (WebQA, Chart-RAG, Visual-RAG, MRAG-Bench). We introduce difficulty-based and ambiguity-aware filtering strategies, alongside MM-RAGChecker, a claim-level diagnostic tool. Our results demonstrate substantial accuracy reductions under difficult and ambiguous queries, highlighting prevalent hallucinations. MM-RAGChecker effectively diagnoses these issues, guiding future improvements in Visual RAG systems.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of online courses and social media has generated large volumes of unstructured learner-generated text. Understanding how learners construct knowledge in these spaces is crucial for analysing learning processes, informing content design, and providing feedback at scale. However, existing approaches typically rely on manual coding of well-structured discussion forums, which does not scale to the fragmented discourse found in online learning. This study proposes and validates a framework that combines a codebook inspired by the Interaction Analysis Model with an automated classifier to enable large-scale analysis of knowledge construction in unstructured online discourse. We adapt four comment-level categories of knowledge construction: Non-Knowledge Construction, Share, Explore, and Integrate. Three trained annotators coded a balanced sample of 20,000 comments from YouTube education channels. The codebook demonstrated strong reliability, with Cohen's kappa = 0.79 on the main dataset and 0.85--0.93 across four additional educational domains. For automated classification, bag-of-words baselines were compared with transformer-based language models using 10-fold cross-validation. A DeBERTa-v3-large model achieved the highest macro-averaged F1 score (0.841), outperforming all baselines and other transformer models. External validation on four domains yielded macro-F1 above 0.705, with stronger transfer in medicine and programming, where discourse was more structured and task-focused, and weaker transfer in language and music, where comments were more varied and context-dependent. Overall, the study shows that theory-driven, semi-automated analysis of knowledge construction at scale is feasible, enabling the integration of knowledge-construction indicators into learning analytics and the design of online learning environments.

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences) in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category, underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable room for future improvement.

Abstract: The rise of social networks has not only facilitated communication but also allowed the spread of harmful content. Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine theory is built on imagistic thinking, in which medical principles and diagnostic and therapeutic logic are structured through metaphor and metonymy. However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences. This study provides a cognitive, efficient and replicable HITL methodological pathway for translation of ancient, concept-dense texts like TCM.

Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the Semantic Web, version control is necessary to capture time-varying information for widely used ontologies. Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component of efficient ontology management, many views treat OV as similar to ontology matching (OM) and directly reuse OM systems for OV tasks. In this study, we systematically analyse the similarities and differences between OM and OV and formalise the OM4OV pipeline. The pipeline is implemented and evaluated in the state-of-the-art OM system Agent-OM. The experimental results indicate that OM systems can be reused for OV tasks, but without necessary modifications, the current OM4OV pipeline can produce skewed measurements, poor performance in detecting update entities, and less explainability for false mappings. To tackle these issues, we propose an optimisation method called the cross-reference (CR) mechanism, building upon the existing alignment(s) from OM to reduce the number of matching candidates and improve overall OV performance.

<title>From Pruning to Grafting: Dynamic Knowledge Redistribution via Learnable Layer Fusion</title>

Abstract: Structured pruning of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) offers a promising path to efficiency but often suffers from irreversible performance degradation due to the discarding of transformer blocks. In this paper, we introduce FuseGPT, a compression paradigm that reframes structured pruning as iterative knowledge grafting rather than simple removal. Motivated by the observation that linear block merging fails to capture non-linear feature disparities and that block importance fluctuates dynamically during pruning, FuseGPT employs a dual-strategy pipeline. First, we propose Macro Influence (MI), a dynamic fusion-aware metric that continuously re-evaluates block redundancy as the network topology evolves. Second, instead of rigid parameter averaging, we introduce a learnable low-rank fusion mechanism that adaptively grafts the knowledge of pruned blocks onto surviving layers via lightweight local distillation. Extensive experiments on LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi families demonstrate that FuseGPT establishes a new state-of-the-art on the compression-accuracy Pareto frontier: at 25\% sparsity, FuseGPT achieves lower perplexity than prior methods at 20\% sparsity, improves zero-shot reasoning by up to 4.5 points, and delivers 1.33$\times$ inference speedup with 25\% memory reduction. Furthermore, FuseGPT is orthogonal to quantization, achieving 52.1\% total compression with negligible quality loss when combined with 4-bit GPTQ. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/FuseGPT.

Abstract: The performance of AI models on safety benchmarks does not indicate their real-world performance after deployment. This opaqueness of AI models impedes existing regulatory frameworks constituted on benchmark performance, leaving them incapable of mitigating ongoing real-world harm.

We propose a simple, realistic and readily usable regulatory framework which does not rely on benchmarks, and call for interdisciplinary collaboration to find new ways to address this crucial problem.

Abstract: Unimodal vision models are known to rely on spurious correlations, but it remains unclear to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit similar biases despite language supervision. In this paper, we investigate spurious bias in MLLMs and introduce SpurLens, a pipeline that leverages GPT-4 and open-set object detectors to automatically identify spurious visual cues without human supervision. Our findings reveal that spurious correlations cause two major failure modes in MLLMs: (1) over-reliance on spurious cues for object recognition, where removing these cues reduces accuracy, and (2) object hallucination, where spurious cues amplify the hallucination by over 10x. We validate our findings in various MLLMs and datasets. Beyond diagnosing these failures, we explore potential mitigation strategies, such as prompt ensembling and reasoning-based prompting, and conduct ablation studies to examine the root causes of spurious bias in MLLMs. By exposing the persistence of spurious correlations, our study calls for more rigorous evaluation methods and mitigation strategies to enhance the reliability of MLLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated dataset labeling with minimal human supervision. While majority voting across multiple LLMs can improve label reliability by mitigating individual model biases, it incurs high computational costs due to repeated querying. In this work, we propose a novel online framework, Cost-aware Majority Voting (CaMVo), for efficient and accurate LLM-based dataset annotation. CaMVo adaptively selects a subset of LLMs for each data instance based on contextual embeddings, balancing confidence and cost without requiring pre-training or ground-truth labels. Leveraging a LinUCB-based selection mechanism and a Bayesian estimator over confidence scores, CaMVo estimates a lower bound on labeling accuracy for each LLM and aggregates responses through weighted majority voting. Our empirical evaluation on the MMLU and IMDB Movie Review datasets demonstrates that CaMVo achieves comparable or superior accuracy to full majority voting while significantly reducing labeling costs. This establishes CaMVo as a practical and robust solution for cost-efficient annotation in dynamic labeling environments.

<title>Pass@K Policy Optimization: Solving Harder Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms sample multiple n>1 solution attempts for each problem and reward them independently. This optimizes for pass@1 performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and efficient transformation function.
  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1 numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.
  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1 optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual samples.

Abstract: Recent advances in model distillation show that data from advanced reasoning models can effectively train smaller student models. However, standard practices discard incorrect reasoning traces -- valuable, yet underutilized data. This paper addresses the critical question: How can both positive and negative distilled reasoning traces be effectively leveraged to maximize LLM reasoning performance in an offline setting? We employ a two-stage training recipe: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on positive traces, followed by a refinement stage using both positive and negative traces. We find that a simple REINFORCE-style objective, which we term the Reinforcement Distillation (REDI) objective, outperforms established preference optimization methods like DPO and SimPO in this distillation context. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. Notably, our Qwen-REDI-1.5B model, trained on just 131k traces from the open Open-R1 dataset, achieves an 83.1% score on MATH-500. Its performance matches that of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model trained on 800k proprietary data. This result showcases the remarkable data efficiency of utilizing previously discarded negative traces.

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction. Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at https://ineqmath.github.io/.

Abstract: Discovering scaling laws for predicting model performance at scale is a fundamental and open-ended challenge, mostly reliant on slow, case specific human experimentation. To investigate the potential for LLMs to automate this process, we collect over 5,000 experiments from existing literature and curate seven diverse scaling law discovery tasks. While existing agents struggle to produce accurate law formulas, this paper introduces SLDAgent, an evolution-based agent that co-optimize the scaling law model and the parameters, enabling it to autonomously explore complex relationships between variables. For the first time, we demonstrates that SLDAgent can automatically discover laws that exhibit consistently more accurate extrapolation than their established, human-derived counterparts across all tasks. Through comprehensive analysis, we elucidate why these discovered laws are superior and verify their practical utility in both pretraining and finetuning applications. This work establishes a new paradigm for agentic scientific discovery, showing that AI systems can understand their own scaling behavior, and can contribute novel and practical knowledge back to the research community.

Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer. An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife is designed around three key paradigm

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144 unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert, Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3) discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g., Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate. Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Hugging Face dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro, WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD configurations. MALLM enables researchers to systematically configure, run, and evaluate debates for their problems, facilitating the understanding of the components and their interplay.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast, In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning. Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results on 12 popular benchmarks and two model families. This finding is not only practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner mechanics of model adaptation.

<title>Beyond Next-Token Prediction: A Performance Characterization of Diffusion versus Autoregressive Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including document processing and code generation. Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs), which generate tokens sequentially conditioned on all previous tokens, have been the predominant paradigm for LLMs. While these models have achieved high accuracy across a range of downstream tasks, they exhibit low arithmetic intensity due to the inherent sequential dependency in next-token prediction. Recently, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative architecture. DLMs generate output tokens in parallel, mitigating the limitations of sequential decoding. However, the performance implications of DLMs relative to commonly deployed ARMs are not fully understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the performance characteristics of ARMs and DLMs, combining theoretical analysis with empirical profiling to characterize the trade-offs between these approaches. We show that although DLMs can achieve higher arithmetic intensity than ARMs by leveraging parallelism across token positions, they fail to scale effectively with longer contexts. We then explore block-wise decoding for DLMs, which decouples arithmetic intensity from sequence length and enables better scaling to long contexts (similar to ARMs). We also examine batched inference and find that ARMs exhibit superior throughput as they benefit more from parallelism across sequences in the batch. Finally, we highlight opportunities for accelerating DLM inference, emphasizing that reducing the number of sampling steps is key for open-source DLMs to achieve lower latency relative to ARMs.

<title>Stable but Miscalibrated: A Kantian View on Overconfidence from Filters to Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds of possible experience. We formalize this intuition in linear-Gaussian state-space models via H-Risk, a composite instability index integrating spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity, and innovation amplification. In simulations, higher H-Risk predicts overconfident errors and degraded closed-loop behavior even when the dynamics remain formally stable, exposing a gap between nominal and epistemic stability.
  Extending this stability lens to large language models (LLMs), we introduce a domain-wise proxy based on confidence fluctuations and overconfident errors. In a binary-question study, a Kantian-inspired policy that permits ''cannot judge'' responses yields targeted reductions in policy-aware squared loss in high-stakes domains relative to an overconfident baseline. To probe internal dynamics, we analyse layer-wise sensitivity of hidden states to small input perturbations. Contrary to a naive instability hypothesis, confidently wrong answers show no instability gap; instead, they are at least as locally stable as confidently correct answers, revealing stable miscalibration in which hallucinations behave like robust but misaligned attractors. For Qwen-2.5, spectral and activation profiles suggest a high signal-to-noise, low effective signal temperature regime in which representations become inertial and resistant to contextual shifts. These results bridge Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, and suggest that stable high-confidence hallucinations may not be readily corrected by output-only heuristics (e.g., temperature scaling or re-sampling), motivating process-level interventions that explicitly perturb and re-evaluate the inference trajectory.

<title>BreakFun: Jailbreaking LLMs via Schema Exploitation</title>

arXiv:2510.17904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing structured data and adhering to syntactic rules is a capability that drives their widespread adoption but also makes them paradoxically vulnerable. In this paper, we investigate this vulnerability through BreakFun, a jailbreak methodology that weaponizes an LLM's adherence to structured schemas. BreakFun employs a three-part prompt that combines an innocent framing and a Chain-of-Thought distraction with a core "Trojan Schema"--a carefully crafted data structure that compels the model to generate harmful content, exploiting the LLM's strong tendency to follow structures and schemas. We demonstrate this vulnerability is highly transferable, achieving an average success rate of 89% across 13 foundational and proprietary models on JailbreakBench, and reaching a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on several prominent models. A rigorous ablation study confirms this Trojan Schema is the attack's primary causal factor. To counter this, we introduce the Adversarial Prompt Deconstruction guardrail, a defense that utilizes a secondary LLM to perform a "Literal Transcription"--extracting all human-readable text to isolate and reveal the user's true harmful intent. Our proof-of-concept guardrail demonstrates high efficacy against the attack, validating that targeting the deceptive schema is a viable mitigation strategy. Our work provides a look into how an LLM's core strengths can be turned into critical weaknesses, offering a fresh perspective for building more robustly aligned models.

Abstract: We present a large-scale analysis of career mobility of college-educated U.S. workers using online resume profiles to investigate how gender, race, and job change options are associated with upward mobility. This study addresses key research questions of how the job changes affect their upward career mobility, and how the outcomes of upward career mobility differ by gender and race. We address data challenges -- such as missing demographic attributes, missing wage data, and noisy occupation labels -- through various data processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. In particular, we develop a large language models (LLMs) based occupation classification method known as FewSOC that achieves accuracy significantly higher than the original occupation labels in the resume dataset. Analysis of 228,710 career trajectories reveals that intra-firm occupation change has been found to facilitate upward mobility most strongly, followed by inter-firm occupation change and inter-firm lateral move. Women and Black college graduates experience significantly lower returns from job changes than men and White peers. Multilevel sensitivity analyses confirm that these disparities are robust to cluster-level heterogeneity and reveal additional intersectional patterns.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents have demonstrated increasing proficiency in scientific tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experimental design to manuscript writing. Such agent systems are commonly referred to as "AI Scientists." However, existing AI Scientists predominantly formulate scientific discovery as a standalone search or optimization problem, overlooking the fact that scientific research is inherently a social and collaborative endeavor. Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniScientist, a framework that explicitly encodes the underlying mechanisms of human research into the AI scientific workflow. OmniScientist not only achieves end-to-end automation across data foundation, literature review, research ideation, experiment automation, scientific writing, and peer review, but also provides comprehensive infrastructural support by simulating the human scientific system, comprising: (1) a structured knowledge system built upon citation networks and conceptual correlations; (2) a collaborative research protocol (OSP), which enables seamless multi-agent collaboration and human researcher participation; and (3) an open evaluation platform (ScienceArena) based on blind pairwise user voting and Elo rankings. This infrastructure empowers agents to not only comprehend and leverage human knowledge systems but also to collaborate and co-evolve, fostering a sustainable and scalable innovation ecosystem.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly used to document clinical encounters, yet its reliability in multilingual and demographically diverse Indian healthcare contexts remains largely unknown. In this study, we conduct the first systematic audit of ASR performance on real world clinical interview data spanning Kannada, Hindi, and Indian English, comparing leading models including Indic Whisper, Whisper, Sarvam, Google speech to text, Gemma3n, Omnilingual, Vaani, and Gemini. We evaluate transcription accuracy across languages, speakers, and demographic subgroups, with a particular focus on error patterns affecting patients vs. clinicians and gender based or intersectional disparities. Our results reveal substantial variability across models and languages, with some systems performing competitively on Indian English but failing on code mixed or vernacular speech. We also uncover systematic performance gaps tied to speaker role and gender, raising concerns about equitable deployment in clinical settings. By providing a comprehensive multilingual benchmark and fairness analysis, our work highlights the need for culturally and demographically inclusive ASR development for healthcare ecosystem in India.

<div> Keywords: African languages, automatic speech recognition, low-resource, pre-trained models, language model decoding<br /><br />Summary:<br /> This paper addresses the challenge of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for African languages, which is limited by scarce labeled data and lack of clear guidance on model choice and data scaling. Four state-of-the-art ASR models—Whisper, XLS-R, MMS, and W2v-BERT—are benchmarked across 13 African languages. The study fine-tunes these models on datasets ranging from 1 to 400 hours of transcribed speech to compare their performance under different conditions. Key findings reveal that MMS and W2v-BERT excel in data efficiency in very low-resource settings, making them more suitable when labeled data is extremely limited. XLS-R demonstrates better scalability and improved performance as the amount of data increases. Whisper shows advantages in scenarios with moderate amounts of data. The research also investigates the role of external language model (LM) decoding, identifying when it improves performance and when it causes errors, dependent on how well acoustic and textual resources align. By examining interactions between pre-training, model structure, dataset domain, and available resources, the study offers practical insights for designing ASR systems tailored to underrepresented African languages. This unified, systematic evaluation provides guidance for future development and deployment of ASR technology in low-resource language contexts. <div>

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for African languages remains constrained by limited labeled data and the lack of systematic guidance on model selection, data scaling, and decoding strategies. Large pre-trained systems such as Whisper, XLS-R, MMS, and W2v-BERT have expanded access to ASR technology, but their comparative behavior in African low-resource contexts has not been studied in a unified and systematic way. In this work, we benchmark four state-of-the-art ASR models across 13 African languages, fine-tuning them on progressively larger subsets of transcribed data ranging from 1 to 400 hours. Beyond reporting error rates, we provide new insights into why models behave differently under varying conditions. We show that MMS and W2v-BERT are more data efficient in very low-resource regimes, XLS-R scales more effectively as additional data becomes available, and Whisper demonstrates advantages in mid-resource conditions. We also analyze where external language model decoding yields improvements and identify cases where it plateaus or introduces additional errors, depending on the alignment between acoustic and text resources. By highlighting the interaction between pre-training coverage, model architecture, dataset domain, and resource availability, this study offers practical and insights into the design of ASR systems for underrepresented languages.

This paper presents MedBioRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented model specifically designed to enhance biomedical QA performance. MedBioRAG combines semantic and lexical search techniques, document retrieval strategies, and supervised fine-tuning to efficiently retrieve and rank relevant biomedical documents. This enables the generation of precise and context-aware responses tailored to biomedical queries. The model is evaluated across multiple benchmark datasets including NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, MedQA, PubMedQA, and BioASQ, covering tasks in text retrieval, close-ended QA, and long-form QA. Experimental results highlight that MedBioRAG consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art models as well as the GPT-4o base model across all evaluated tasks. Specifically, it achieves significant improvements in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for document retrieval, higher accuracy for close-ended QA, and better ROUGE scores for long-form QA. These findings demonstrate the value of integrating semantic search-based retrieval with LLM fine-tuning to advance biomedical question-answering systems. <div>

<div> Keywords: Knowledge Base Question Answering, Reinforcement Learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, Referenced Rejection Sampling, Large Language Models  

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses key challenges in Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), where models must translate natural language questions into executable queries against structured knowledge graphs. Current Large Language Model approaches either hallucinate unsupported queries or rely on rigid, template-like reasoning that lacks true understanding of knowledge graph schemas. To overcome these problems, the authors propose KBQA-R1, a novel framework that reframes KBQA as a multi-turn decision-making process optimized through Reinforcement Learning. KBQA-R1 uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to iteratively improve its action strategies based on actual execution feedback rather than relying solely on static supervised signals. Additionally, the paper introduces Referenced Rejection Sampling (RRS), a data synthesis technique that alleviates cold-start issues by ensuring generated reasoning traces strictly align with grounded, correct action sequences. Experimental results on standard KBQA benchmarks—WebQSP, GrailQA, and GraphQuestions—demonstrate that KBQA-R1 outperforms existing methods, showing superior accuracy and effectively grounding language model reasoning in verifiable executions on knowledge bases. Overall, KBQA-R1 bridges the gap between flexible language understanding and rigorous logical form generation by combining interactive learning with robust data synthesis. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) challenges models to bridge the gap between natural language and strict knowledge graph schemas by generating executable logical forms. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced this field, current approaches often struggle with a dichotomy of failure: they either generate hallucinated queries without verifying schema existence or exhibit rigid, template-based reasoning that mimics synthesized traces without true comprehension of the environment. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{KBQA-R1}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from text imitation to interaction optimization via Reinforcement Learning. Treating KBQA as a multi-turn decision process, our model learns to navigate the knowledge base using a list of actions, leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine its strategies based on concrete execution feedback rather than static supervision. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Referenced Rejection Sampling (RRS)}, a data synthesis method that resolves cold-start challenges by strictly aligning reasoning traces with ground-truth action sequences. Extensive experiments on WebQSP, GrailQA, and GraphQuestions demonstrate that KBQA-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively grounding LLM reasoning in verifiable execution.

<div> Keywords: prompt design, few-shot examples, Monte Carlo Shapley, automatic prompting, text simplification<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, yet manually creating effective prompts, especially few-shot examples, is challenging and complex. This paper introduces a fast automatic prompt construction algorithm that enhances human instructions by generating a small, optimized set of few-shot examples. The method iteratively replaces, drops, or keeps examples based on Monte Carlo Shapley value estimation to measure example utility. To improve computational efficiency, the approach uses aggressive subsampling and a replay buffer, allowing it to operate under different compute time budgets. Experimental results show that on limited budgets, the method outperforms existing automatic prompting techniques on tasks such as text simplification and GSM8K, while achieving second-best results in classification and summarization. With a moderately larger compute budget, it sets a new state of the art among automatic prompting algorithms across classification, simplification, and GSM8K tasks. The findings emphasize that the quality and careful selection of few-shot examples, rather than exhaustive search over instructions, are crucial for fast and data-efficient prompt engineering. The code for the approach is publicly available at the provided GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt design, but handcrafting effective prompts is difficult and often requires intricate crafting of few-shot examples. We propose a fast automatic prompt construction algorithm that augments human instructions by generating a small set of few shot examples. Our method iteratively replaces/drops/keeps few-shot examples using Monte Carlo Shapley estimation of example utility. For faster execution, we use aggressive subsampling and a replay buffer for faster evaluations. Our method can be run using different compute time budgets. On a limited budget, we outperform existing automatic prompting methods on text simplification and GSM8K and obtain second best results on classification and summarization. With an extended, but still modest compute budget we set a new state of the art among automatic prompting methods on classification, simplification and GSM8K. Our results show that carefully constructed examples, rather than exhaustive instruction search, are the dominant lever for fast and data efficient prompt engineering.

<div> Keywords: Multi30k, multimodal machine translation, language diversity, dataset extension, NLLB200-3.3B<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The Multi30k dataset is a commonly used resource in multimodal machine translation (MMT) but is limited to four European languages in Latin script: Czech, English, French, and German. This linguistic restriction has hindered research progress in MMT for a broader range of languages and scripts. Although some extensions to Multi30k exist, they cover only a few languages and lack diverse language families and scripts. To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce MultiScript30k, a new extension of the Multi30k dataset that includes global languages in various scripts by translating the English subset (Multi30k-En) using the NLLB200-3.3B translation model. MultiScript30k comprises over 30,000 sentences translated into Arabic (Ar), Spanish (Es), Ukrainian (Uk), Simplified Chinese (Zh_Hans), and Traditional Chinese (Zh_Hant). Quantitative similarity analyses demonstrate that MultiScript30k translations achieve high cosine similarity scores above 0.8 and very low symmetric KL divergence below 0.000251 for all languages except Traditional Chinese, which performs comparably to previous Multi30k extensions such as ArEnMulti30k and Multi30k-Uk. COMETKiwi evaluation metrics show mixed results: the Arabic extension matches the quality of ArEnMulti30k, while the Ukrainian extension scores 6.4% lower than Multi30k-Uk per data split. This work advances MMT research by diversifying language representation in a key dataset. <div>

Abstract: Multi30k is frequently cited in the multimodal machine translation (MMT) literature, offering parallel text data for training and fine-tuning deep learning models. However, it is limited to four languages: Czech, English, French, and German. This restriction has led many researchers to focus their investigations only on these languages. As a result, MMT research on diverse languages has been stalled because the official Multi30k dataset only represents European languages in Latin scripts. Previous efforts to extend Multi30k exist, but the list of supported languages, represented language families, and scripts is still very short. To address these issues, we propose MultiScript30k, a new Multi30k dataset extension for global languages in various scripts, created by translating the English version of Multi30k (Multi30k-En) using NLLB200-3.3B. The dataset consists of over \(30000\) sentences and provides translations of all sentences in Multi30k-En into Ar, Es, Uk, Zh\_Hans and Zh\_Hant. Similarity analysis shows that Multi30k extension consistently achieves greater than \(0.8\) cosine similarity and symmetric KL divergence less than \(0.000251\) for all languages supported except Zh\_Hant which is comparable to the previous Multi30k extensions ArEnMulti30k and Multi30k-Uk. COMETKiwi scores reveal mixed assessments of MultiScript30k as a translation of Multi30k-En in comparison to the related work. ArEnMulti30k scores nearly equal MultiScript30k-Ar, but Multi30k-Uk scores $6.4\%$ greater than MultiScript30k-Uk per split.

<div> Keywords: iMessage, messaging data, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, response times  

<br /><br />Summary: This paper explores the valuable insights that can be derived from users' iMessage data, which Apple uniquely stores locally on Mac devices in a single file containing messages and metadata. The study aims to answer five primary research questions related to analyzing text message content and interaction patterns through an iMessage text message analyzer developed by the authors. Key analytical focuses include topic modeling to uncover prevalent themes in conversations, measuring response times to gauge communication dynamics, applying reluctance scoring to assess hesitation or unwillingness in replies, and performing sentiment analysis to understand emotional tone within messages. By leveraging this local dataset, the research highlights how users can gain greater awareness and control over their messaging data, turning it from a hidden resource into a personal asset. The exploratory data demonstrated the analyzer’s utility in answering the posed questions effectively, indicating potential applications in privacy, communication studies, and personalized user experience improvements. Ultimately, the paper advocates for more transparent use and study of messaging data stored on personal devices, thereby opening new avenues for understanding digital communication behavior in a secure and user-centered manner. <div>

Abstract: What is your messaging data used for? While many users do not often think about the information companies can gather based off of their messaging platform of choice, it is nonetheless important to consider as society increasingly relies on short-form electronic communication. While most companies keep their data closely guarded, inaccessible to users or potential hackers, Apple has opened a door to their walled-garden ecosystem, providing iMessage users on Mac with one file storing all their messages and attached metadata. With knowledge of this locally stored file, the question now becomes: What can our data do for us? In the creation of our iMessage text message analyzer, we set out to answer five main research questions focusing on topic modeling, response times, reluctance scoring, and sentiment analysis. This paper uses our exploratory data to show how these questions can be answered using our analyzer and its potential in future studies on iMessage data.

<title>Explanation Bias is a Product: Revealing the Hidden Lexical and Position Preferences in Post-Hoc Feature Attribution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: feature attribution, explanation bias, transformers, lexical bias, position bias<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper focuses on understanding the varying explanations generated by feature attribution methods like Integrated Gradient, which offer token-level insights into language model predictions. It highlights the problem that different attribution methods can produce inconsistent explanations on the same input, leading to potential mistrust or blind trust among users. The authors propose a framework for systematically structuring these biases, using three evaluation metrics that are both model- and method-agnostic. They conduct experiments on two transformer models, assessing lexical bias (which tokens are considered important) and position bias (where in the input these important tokens appear). The evaluation is performed in two settings: a controlled pseudo-random classification task with artificial data and a semi-controlled causal relation detection task using natural data. Results reveal an inverse relationship where models that emphasize lexical bias score lower on position bias, and vice versa. Additionally, the study observes that methods generating anomalous or unusual explanations tend to be more biased themselves. Overall, the work sheds light on the structural imbalances in explanation biases across models and methods, encouraging more nuanced interpretation and evaluation of feature attribution explanations in language models. <div>

Abstract: Good quality explanations strengthen the understanding of language models and data. Feature attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradient, are a type of post-hoc explainer that can provide token-level insights. However, explanations on the same input may vary greatly due to underlying biases of different methods. Users may be aware of this issue and mistrust their utility, while unaware users may trust them inadequately. In this work, we delve beyond the superficial inconsistencies between attribution methods, structuring their biases through a model- and method-agnostic framework of three evaluation metrics. We systematically assess both the lexical and position bias (what and where in the input) for two transformers; first, in a controlled, pseudo-random classification task on artificial data; then, in a semi-controlled causal relation detection task on natural data. We find that lexical and position biases are structurally unbalanced in our model comparison, with models that score high on one type score low on the other. We also find signs that methods producing anomalous explanations are more likely to be biased themselves.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: FIBER, multilingual benchmark, factual knowledge, inference bias, large language models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces FIBER, a new multilingual benchmark designed to evaluate factual knowledge in large language models across single-entity and multi-entity settings. Unlike most existing benchmarks that focus on monolingual and single-entity facts, FIBER incorporates tasks such as sentence completion, question-answering, and object-count prediction in English, Italian, and Turkish. The study investigates whether the language of the prompt influences inference bias in entity selection, finding that prompt language can affect generated outputs, especially for entities related to the prompt’s country. This influence varies across topics with 31% showing a factual inference bias score above 0.5. Additionally, the extent of bias differs between languages, with Turkish prompts showing higher bias than Italian in 83% of topics, indicating a language-dependent pattern. Model performance on multi-entity questions is poorer compared to single-entity questions, highlighting a particular challenge in handling multi-entity factual reasoning. Performance also varies by language and model size, with the highest average precision in English and noticeably lower scores for Turkish and Italian. Larger models such as Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B consistently outperform smaller models within the 3B-4B parameter range. <div>

Abstract: Large language models are widely used across domains, yet there are concerns about their factual reliability and biases. Factual knowledge probing offers a systematic means to evaluate these aspects. Most existing benchmarks focus on single-entity facts and monolingual data. We therefore present FIBER, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating factual knowledge in single- and multi-entity settings. The dataset includes sentence completion, question-answering, and object-count prediction tasks in English, Italian, and Turkish. Using FIBER, we examine whether the prompt language induces inference bias in entity selection and how large language models perform on multi-entity versus single-entity questions. The results indicate that the language of the prompt can influence the model's generated output, particularly for entities associated with the country corresponding to that language. However, this effect varies across different topics such that 31% of the topics exhibit factual inference bias score greater than 0.5. Moreover, the level of bias differs across languages such that Turkish prompts show higher bias compared to Italian in 83% of the topics, suggesting a language-dependent pattern. Our findings also show that models face greater difficulty when handling multi-entity questions than the single-entity questions. Model performance differs across both languages and model sizes. The highest mean average precision is achieved in English, while Turkish and Italian lead to noticeably lower scores. Larger models, including Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, show consistently better performance than smaller 3B-4B models.

arXiv:2512.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-intent spoken language understanding (SLU) involves two tasks: multiple intent detection and slot filling, which jointly handle utterances containing more than one intent. Owing to this characteristic, which closely reflects real-world applications, the task has attracted increasing research attention, and substantial progress has been achieved. However, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic review of existing studies on multi-intent SLU. To this end, this paper presents a survey of recent advances in multi-intent SLU. We provide an in-depth overview of previous research from two perspectives: decoding paradigms and modeling approaches. On this basis, we further compare the performance of representative models and analyze their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and outline promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will offer valuable insights and serve as a useful reference for advancing research in multi-intent SLU.

<title>Leveraging LLMs for Title and Abstract Screening for Systematic Review: A Cost-Effective Dynamic Few-Shot Learning Approach</title>

<div> Keywords: systematic reviews, few-shot learning, large language models, title and abstract screening, computational efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Systematic reviews are essential for evidence-based medicine, synthesizing research to inform clinical decisions. However, the increase in research publications has made conducting these reviews more time-consuming, particularly during the title and abstract screening stage. To address this challenge, the authors propose a two-stage dynamic few-shot learning (DFSL) method. This approach initially employs a low-cost large language model (LLM) to perform primary screening of titles and abstracts. For instances where the model shows low confidence, a second stage re-evaluates them using a higher-performance LLM. This strategy balances improved screening accuracy with controlled computational costs. The DFSL method was tested on 10 different systematic reviews, showing strong generalizability across topics. Results indicate that the approach effectively reduces the manual workload involved in screening and accelerates the overall systematic review process. By combining cost-effectiveness with enhanced performance, this method holds promise for practical adoption in systematic review workflows, potentially streamlining evidence synthesis in medical research. <div>

Abstract: Systematic reviews are a key component of evidence-based medicine, playing a critical role in synthesizing existing research evidence and guiding clinical decisions. However, with the rapid growth of research publications, conducting systematic reviews has become increasingly burdensome, with title and abstract screening being one of the most time-consuming and resource-intensive steps. To mitigate this issue, we designed a two-stage dynamic few-shot learning (DFSL) approach aimed at improving the efficiency and performance of large language models (LLMs) in the title and abstract screening task. Specifically, this approach first uses a low-cost LLM for initial screening, then re-evaluates low-confidence instances using a high-performance LLM, thereby enhancing screening performance while controlling computational costs. We evaluated this approach across 10 systematic reviews, and the results demonstrate its strong generalizability and cost-effectiveness, with potential to reduce manual screening burden and accelerate the systematic review process in practical applications.

<div> Reasoning, Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Tool Invocation, Generalization  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of improving the generalization ability of large language models (LLMs) through enhanced reasoning during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). While SFT is effective for downstream tasks, it struggles when the data distribution shifts slightly, limiting reliability. The authors highlight recent reasoning-focused models that outperform non-reasoning ones, emphasizing the critical role of reasoning for better performance. Collecting high-quality reasoning annotations, however, is costly and not scalable. To overcome this, the paper proposes leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) to teach models reasoning strategies directly from task outcomes without explicit annotations. Their approach integrates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize reasoning steps that guide both tool usage (such as function calls) and final answer generation in conversational agents. The rewards are designed to improve tool accuracy and answer correctness, enabling iterative refinement. Experimental results show that this method achieves a 1.5% relative improvement over standard SFT models and a 40% improvement compared to the baseline Qwen3-1.7B model. Overall, the study demonstrates that unifying reasoning with action learning via RL can lead to more capable, generalizable conversational agents, reducing dependence on costly manual reasoning annotations. <div>
arXiv:2512.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as one of the most effective ways to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. However, SFT can have difficulty generalizing when the underlying data distribution changes, even when the new data does not fall completely outside the training domain. Recent reasoning-focused models such as o1 and R1 have demonstrated consistent gains over their non-reasoning counterparts, highlighting the importance of reasoning for improved generalization and reliability. However, collecting high-quality reasoning traces for SFT remains challenging -- annotations are costly, subjective, and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable models to learn reasoning strategies directly from task outcomes. We propose a pipeline in which LLMs generate reasoning steps that guide both the invocation of tools (e.g., function calls) and the final answer generation for conversational agents. Our method employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with rewards designed around tool accuracy and answer correctness, allowing the model to iteratively refine its reasoning and actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves both the quality of reasoning and the precision of tool invocations, achieving a 1.5% relative improvement over the SFT model (trained without explicit thinking) and a 40% gain compared to the base of the vanilla Qwen3-1.7B model. These findings demonstrate the promise of unifying reasoning and action learning through RL to build more capable and generalizable conversational agents.

<div> Keywords: Adaptive Speculative Decoding, Large Language Models, Inference Speedup, Hyperparameter-Free, Token Entropy<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but suffer from slow inference due to their large parameter sizes. Speculative decoding speeds up inference by using smaller draft models to predict candidate tokens that are verified by larger target models. However, existing speculative decoding methods typically need extra training, extensive hyperparameter tuning, or prior task and model analysis, which complicates deployment. This paper proposes Adaptive Speculative Decoding (AdaSD), a novel decoding scheme that eliminates these requirements by dynamically adjusting generation length and token acceptance criteria during inference without any hyperparameters. AdaSD introduces two adaptive thresholds updated in real time: one governs when to stop generating candidate tokens, and the other decides acceptance based on metrics such as token entropy and Jensen-Shannon distance. This enables compatibility with off-the-shelf models and avoids pre-analysis or fine-tuning. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaSD achieves up to 49% inference speedup compared to standard speculative decoding methods while keeping accuracy degradation below 2%. Overall, AdaSD offers a practical, efficient, and adaptive approach to improve the inference speed of large language models without sacrificing output quality or requiring additional training overhead. <div>
arXiv:2512.11280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, but their increasing parameter sizes significantly slow down inference. Speculative decoding mitigates this issue by leveraging a smaller draft model to predict candidate tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, existing approaches often require additional training, extensive hyperparameter tuning, or prior analysis of models and tasks before deployment. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Speculative Decoding (AdaSD), a hyperparameter-free decoding scheme that dynamically adjusts generation length and acceptance criteria during inference. AdaSD introduces two adaptive thresholds: one to determine when to stop candidate token generation and another to decide token acceptance, both updated in real time based on token entropy and Jensen-Shannon distance. This approach eliminates the need for pre-analysis or fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf models. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaSD achieves up to 49\% speedup over standard speculative decoding while limiting accuracy degradation to under 2\%, making it a practical solution for efficient and adaptive LLM inference.

<title>CIP: A Plug-and-Play Causal Prompting Framework for Mitigating Hallucinations under Long-Context Noise</title>

<div> Keywords: Large language models, causal prompting, hallucination mitigation, causal reasoning, reasoning quality  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Large language models (LLMs) often hallucinate when processing lengthy and noisy retrieval contexts due to reliance on spurious correlations rather than true causal relationships. To address this, the paper proposes CIP, a lightweight, plug-and-play causal prompting framework designed to mitigate hallucinations at the input stage. CIP works by constructing a causal relation sequence among entities, actions, and events, which is then injected into prompts to steer the model's reasoning toward causally relevant evidence. Leveraging causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning techniques, CIP effectively suppresses non-causal reasoning paths, resulting in improved factual grounding and enhanced interpretability of model outputs. Experimental evaluation across seven mainstream LLMs—including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Llama 3.1—demonstrates consistent improvements: a 2.6-point increase in Attributable Rate, a 0.38 gain in Causal Consistency Score, and a fourfold boost in effective information density. Additionally, API-level profiling indicates that CIP accelerates contextual understanding and reduces the overall response latency by up to 55.1%. These results highlight causal reasoning as a promising paradigm to enhance the explainability, stability, and efficiency of large language models in practical applications. <div>

The dataset consists of 100 samples that require long-form, structured outputs and was created by legal professionals under attorney supervision. The benchmark was evaluated using both human and automated methods with state-of-the-art large language models, including GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.1. Human evaluation revealed that abstract instructions led to unnecessary modifications, exposing weaknesses of current models in document-level editing—an issue often overlooked in short-text tasks. The study further found that automated evaluations correlate well with human judgments when criteria have clear linguistic grounding. However, assessing structural consistency remains challenging for automated metrics. The results demonstrate that automated tools can effectively serve as screening mechanisms when access to expert reviewers is limited. Lastly, the authors propose a dataset evaluation framework aimed at encouraging more practice-oriented legal research, fostering improvements in LLM performance on complex, realistic legal tasks. <div>

Our human evaluation revealed that abstract instructions prompted unnecessary modifications, highlighting model weaknesses in document-level editing that were missed by conventional short-text tasks. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that automated evaluation aligns well with human judgment on criteria with clear linguistic grounding, and assessing structural consistency remains a challenge. The result demonstrates the utility of automated evaluation as a screening tool when expert availability is limited. We propose a dataset evaluation framework to promote more practice-oriented research in the legal domain.

<div> Keywords: SMITH, tool creation, experience sharing, hierarchical memory, curriculum learning  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper introduces SMITH (Shared Memory Integrated Tool Hub), a novel cognitive architecture designed to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agents' adaptability to novel tasks by integrating dynamic tool creation with experience sharing across tasks. SMITH addresses limitations of existing methods that depend either on a fixed set of tools or build tools from scratch without leveraging previous experiences, resulting in inefficiency and lower performance. The architecture organizes agent memory hierarchically into procedural, semantic, and episodic components, supporting systematic capability growth while maintaining effective execution patterns. Tool creation is formalized as an iterative code generation process within controlled sandbox environments, ensuring safe and reliable development of new tools. Experience sharing is achieved through episodic memory retrieval using semantic similarity matching, enabling agents to reuse successful strategies intelligently. Additionally, the authors propose a curriculum learning approach driven by agent-ensemble difficulty re-estimation, which adapts the learning process based on task complexity. Experimental results on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate SMITH’s superior performance with an 81.8% Pass@1 accuracy, significantly outperforming leading baselines such as Alita (75.2%) and Memento (70.9%). Overall, the work lays foundational principles for creating truly adaptive LLM agents capable of continuous capability evolution via integrated tool creation and accumulated experiences. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model agents face fundamental challenges in adapting to novel tasks due to limitations in tool availability and experience reuse. Existing approaches either rely on predefined tools with limited coverage or build tools from scratch without leveraging past experiences, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal performance. We introduce SMITH (Shared Memory Integrated Tool Hub), a unified cognitive architecture that seamlessly integrates dynamic tool creation with cross-task experience sharing through hierarchical memory organization. SMITH organizes agent memory into procedural, semantic, and episodic components, enabling systematic capability expansion while preserving successful execution patterns. Our approach formalizes tool creation as iterative code generation within controlled sandbox environments and experience sharing through episodic memory retrieval with semantic similarity matching. We further propose a curriculum learning strategy based on agent-ensemble difficulty re-estimation. Extensive experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate SMITH's effectiveness, achieving 81.8% Pass@1 accuracy and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines including Alita (75.2%) and Memento (70.9%). Our work establishes a foundation for building truly adaptive agents that continuously evolve their capabilities through principled integration of tool creation and experience accumulation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: LoRA fusion, query-adaptive, parameter-efficient finetuning, multi-domain adaptation, LLaMA models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of fusing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for large language models specialized in multiple domains without requiring supervised training or domain-specific composite data. The authors introduce qa-FLoRA, a novel method that dynamically computes layer-level fusion weights by measuring the distributional divergence between the base model and each domain-specific LoRA adapter in a data- and training-free manner. This query-adaptive fusion method overcomes the limitations of existing static-weight fusion or data-intensive supervised fusion approaches. Experimental evaluations on nine multilingual composite tasks, covering domains such as mathematics, coding, and medicine, demonstrate that qa-FLoRA significantly outperforms static fusion approaches by approximately 5% with LLaMA-2 and 6% with LLaMA-3 models. It also surpasses other training-free baselines by around 7% with LLaMA-2 and 10% with LLaMA-3, narrowing the performance gap with fully supervised fusion methods. Additionally, analysis at the layer-level reveals interpretable and effective fusion weight patterns, supporting the robustness and generalizability of qa-FLoRA for multi-domain adaptation in large language models. <div>

Abstract: The deployment of large language models for specialized tasks often requires domain-specific parameter-efficient finetuning through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules. However, effectively fusing these adapters to handle complex, multi-domain composite queries remains a critical challenge. Existing LoRA fusion approaches either use static weights, which assign equal relevance to each participating LoRA, or require data-intensive supervised training for every possible LoRA combination to obtain respective optimal fusion weights. We propose qa-FLoRA, a novel query-adaptive data-and-training-free method for LoRA fusion that dynamically computes layer-level fusion weights by measuring distributional divergence between the base model and respective adapters. Our approach eliminates the need for composite training data or domain-representative samples, making it readily applicable to existing adapter collections. Extensive experiments across nine multilingual composite tasks spanning mathematics, coding, and medical domains, show that qa-FLoRA outperforms static fusion by ~5% with LLaMA-2 and ~6% with LLaMA-3, and the training-free baselines by ~7% with LLaMA-2 and ~10% with LLaMA-3, while significantly closing the gap with supervised baselines. Further, layer-level analysis of our fusion weights reveals interpretable fusion patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for robust multi-domain adaptation.

<div> Keywords: judicial reasoning, Czech Supreme Courts, natural language processing, legal argument mining, formalism  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study addresses the challenge of scaling systematic analysis of judicial reasoning by focusing on decisions from Czech Supreme Courts. It refutes existing claims of formalistic judging in Central and Eastern Europe by employing advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods. The researchers developed the MADON dataset, containing 272 court decisions with 9,183 expert-annotated paragraphs classified into eight argument types alongside formalism labels. To adapt large language models (LLMs) for the Czech legal domain, the study used continued pretraining on a corpus of 300,000 Czech court decisions. The team tackled dataset imbalance issues using techniques such as asymmetric loss and class weighting. Their top-performing models achieved strong results in detecting argumentative paragraphs (82.6% macro-F1), classifying legal argument types (77.5% macro-F1), and distinguishing formalistic versus non-formalistic decisions (83.2% macro-F1). The research introduced a three-stage pipeline combining ModernBERT, Llama 3.1, and traditional machine learning to boost classification performance while improving explainability and reducing computational costs. Empirically, this work challenges prevailing narratives about judicial formalism in Central and Eastern Europe. The methodology is designed to be replicable across different jurisdictions and offers resources including datasets, guidelines, models, and code openly available for the research community. <div>

Abstract: Courts must justify their decisions, but systematically analyzing judicial reasoning at scale remains difficult. This study refutes claims about formalistic judging in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) by developing automated methods to detect and classify judicial reasoning in Czech Supreme Courts' decisions using state-of-the-art natural language processing methods. We create the MADON dataset of 272 decisions from two Czech Supreme Courts with expert annotations of 9,183 paragraphs with eight argument types and holistic formalism labels for supervised training and evaluation. Using a corpus of 300k Czech court decisions, we adapt transformer LLMs for Czech legal domain by continued pretraining and experiment with methods to address dataset imbalance including asymmetric loss and class weighting. The best models successfully detect argumentative paragraphs (82.6\% macro-F1), classify traditional types of legal argument (77.5\% macro-F1), and classify decisions as formalistic/non-formalistic (83.2\% macro-F1). Our three-stage pipeline combining ModernBERT, Llama 3.1, and traditional feature-based machine learning achieves promising results for decision classification while reducing computational costs and increasing explainability. Empirically, we challenge prevailing narratives about CEE formalism. This work shows that legal argument mining enables reliable judicial philosophy classification and shows the potential of legal argument mining for other important tasks in computational legal studies. Our methodology is easily replicable across jurisdictions, and our entire pipeline, datasets, guidelines, models, and source codes are available at https://github.com/trusthlt/madon.

<title>Improving Translation Quality by Selecting Better Data for LLM Fine-Tuning: A Comparative Analysis</title>

<div> Keywords: data selection, machine translation, fine-tuning, semantic selectors, model performance<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study examined how data selection influences the fine-tuning of open large language models (LLMs) for machine translation tasks, specifically between Japanese and English. Five data selection methods were evaluated under consistent training conditions: TF-IDF, COMET Kiwi, QuRate, FD-Score, and random selection. The research found that semantic-based selection techniques, such as COMET Kiwi, significantly outperformed lexical methods like TF-IDF and geometry-based heuristics. Notably, even minimal differences in selected data subsets—less than 3%—had a considerable impact on the performance of the fine-tuned models. This highlights that fine-tuning processes are highly sensitive to the quality and nature of the training data used. Overall, the findings reinforce the importance of choosing semantically relevant datasets when optimizing translation models, as this directly contributes to improved translation accuracy and model efficiency. This work suggests that future research and practical applications should prioritize advanced semantic data selection strategies over simpler heuristics or random choices to maximize fine-tuning effectiveness in machine translation. <div>

Abstract: We investigated the impact of data selection on machine translation fine-tuning for open LLMs. Using Japanese-English corpora, we compare five selectors: TF-IDF, COMET Kiwi, QuRate, FD-Score, and random selection, under controlled training conditions. We observed that semantic selectors consistently outperform lexical and geometry-based heuristics, and that even when the selected data differ by less than 3%, the impact on model performance is substantial, underscoring the sensitivity of fine-tuning to data quality.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, clip selection, video summarization, lightweight captioning, MovieSum dataset<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper addresses the challenge of preserving important visual information in long videos for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which often lose key details across extended content.  
2. The authors propose a novel clip selection method that identifies key video moments to be integrated into a multimodal summary, aimed at efficient and relevant video analysis.  
3. The approach segments videos into short clips, generates compact visual descriptions using a lightweight captioning model, and then employs a large language model (LLM) to select the top K clips with the most relevant visual content.  
4. The method is evaluated on the MovieSum dataset, where reference clips—derived from human-annotated screenplays and summaries—represent less than 6% of the entire movie yet suffice for a complete multimodal summary.  
5. Results show that the proposed clip selection closely matches the summarization quality of these reference clips, significantly outperforming random clip selection while maintaining a low computational cost through the use of the lightweight captioning model. <div>
arXiv:2512.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are able to process increasingly longer videos. Yet, important visual information is easily lost throughout the entire context and missed by VLMs. Also, it is important to design tools that enable cost-effective analysis of lengthy video content. In this paper, we propose a clip selection method that targets key video moments to be included in a multimodal summary. We divide the video into short clips and generate compact visual descriptions of each using a lightweight video captioning model. These are then passed to a large language model (LLM), which selects the K clips containing the most relevant visual information for a multimodal summary. We evaluate our approach on reference clips for the task, automatically derived from full human-annotated screenplays and summaries in the MovieSum dataset. We further show that these reference clips (less than 6% of the movie) are sufficient to build a complete multimodal summary of the movies in MovieSum. Using our clip selection method, we achieve a summarization performance close to that of these reference clips while capturing substantially more relevant video information than random clip selection. Importantly, we maintain low computational cost by relying on a lightweight captioning model.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: language models, healthcare, multilingual, trustworthiness, evaluation<br /><br />Summary: Integrating language models (LMs) into healthcare systems offers significant potential for advancing medical workflows and decision-making processes. However, a major obstacle to their widespread adoption is the difficulty in reliably evaluating their trustworthiness, particularly in multilingual healthcare environments. Current LMs are predominantly trained on high-resource languages, limiting their ability to effectively handle the complexity and diversity of healthcare queries in mid- and low-resource languages. To address this gap, the authors introduce CLINIC, a Comprehensive Multilingual Benchmark designed to assess the trustworthiness of LMs in healthcare across five critical dimensions: truthfulness, fairness, safety, robustness, and privacy. The benchmark comprises 18 diverse tasks spanning 15 languages representing all major continents, and covers a broad range of vital healthcare topics such as disease conditions, preventive actions, diagnostic tests, treatments, surgeries, and medications. Through extensive evaluation, CLINIC reveals that existing LMs often struggle with factual correctness, exhibit biases related to demographic and linguistic factors, and remain vulnerable to privacy breaches and adversarial attacks. By exposing these challenges, CLINIC sets the stage for developing more trustworthy, safer, and globally applicable language models that can better serve diverse linguistic communities in healthcare contexts. <div>

Abstract: Integrating language models (LMs) in healthcare systems holds great promise for improving medical workflows and decision-making. However, a critical barrier to their real-world adoption is the lack of reliable evaluation of their trustworthiness, especially in multilingual healthcare settings. Existing LMs are predominantly trained in high-resource languages, making them ill-equipped to handle the complexity and diversity of healthcare queries in mid- and low-resource languages, posing significant challenges for deploying them in global healthcare contexts where linguistic diversity is key. In this work, we present CLINIC, a Comprehensive Multilingual Benchmark to evaluate the trustworthiness of language models in healthcare. CLINIC systematically benchmarks LMs across five key dimensions of trustworthiness: truthfulness, fairness, safety, robustness, and privacy, operationalized through 18 diverse tasks, spanning 15 languages (covering all the major continents), and encompassing a wide array of critical healthcare topics like disease conditions, preventive actions, diagnostic tests, treatments, surgeries, and medications. Our extensive evaluation reveals that LMs struggle with factual correctness, demonstrate bias across demographic and linguistic groups, and are susceptible to privacy breaches and adversarial attacks. By highlighting these shortcomings, CLINIC lays the foundation for enhancing the global reach and safety of LMs in healthcare across diverse languages.

<title>Mistake Notebook Learning: Selective Batch-Wise Context Optimization for In-Context Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Mistake Notebook Learning, large language models, error abstraction, training-free framework, complex reasoning<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the limitations of existing adaptation methods for large language models (LLMs), specifically gradient fine-tuning and In-Context Learning (ICL). Gradient fine-tuning is computationally heavy and prone to catastrophic forgetting, while ICL suffers from low robustness and poor mistake learning. The authors propose Mistake Notebook Learning (MNL), a novel, training-free framework that maintains a persistent knowledge base of abstracted error patterns. Unlike prior approaches that memorize instances or single trajectories, MNL performs batch-wise error abstraction, extracting generalizable guidance from multiple failures. This guidance is stored dynamically in a notebook and validated through a hold-out set to ensure only improvements over a baseline persist, guaranteeing monotonic model enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that MNL nearly matches the performance of traditional supervised fine-tuning on GSM8K (93.9% vs. 94.3%) and surpasses other training-free methods on several benchmarks including GSM8K, Spider, AIME, and KaggleDBQA. Notably, on KaggleDBQA using Qwen3-8B, MNL achieves 28% accuracy, representing a 47% relative gain, outperforming previous training-free techniques such as Memento and GRPO. Overall, MNL offers a robust, efficient, and training-free alternative for improving complex reasoning tasks in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) adapt to tasks via gradient fine-tuning (heavy computation, catastrophic forgetting) or In-Context Learning (ICL: low robustness, poor mistake learning). To fix this, we introduce Mistake Notebook Learning (MNL), a training-free framework with a persistent knowledge base of abstracted error patterns. Unlike prior instance/single-trajectory memory methods, MNL uses batch-wise error abstraction: it extracts generalizable guidance from multiple failures, stores insights in a dynamic notebook, and retains only baseline-outperforming guidance via hold-out validation (ensuring monotonic improvement). We show MNL nearly matches Supervised Fine-Tuning (93.9% vs 94.3% on GSM8K) and outperforms training-free alternatives on GSM8K, Spider, AIME, and KaggleDBQA. On KaggleDBQA (Qwen3-8B), MNL hits 28% accuracy (47% relative gain), outperforming Memento (15.1%) and Training-Free GRPO (22.1) - proving it's a strong training-free alternative for complex reasoning.

The article introduces a novel Hebrew medical language model aimed at extracting structured clinical timelines from electronic health records (EHRs), which are used to construct detailed patient journeys.<br /><br />2.

Experimental results demonstrate the model’s strong performance across both datasets, validating its utility in accurately capturing temporal clinical events.<br /><br />5. Additional findings reveal that adapting the model’s vocabulary leads to improved token efficiency, and importantly, the process of de-identification does not adversely affect downstream task performance, which underscores the balance between privacy preservation and model accuracy.<br /><br />6. The model is made accessible to the research community with ethical restrictions, promoting privacy-conscious advances in Hebrew medical NLP. <div>

<div> Hallucination, Large Language Models, Creativity, Scientific Discovery, Verification Techniques  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper explores the impact of hallucination-reduction techniques on the creativity of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in the context of AI-assisted scientific discovery where factual accuracy and creativity are both vital. The authors focus on three methods: Chain of Verification (CoVe), Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). They evaluate these approaches across multiple LLM families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral) and model scales ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters. Creativity is assessed using two benchmarks: NeoCoder and CS4. Findings indicate that the techniques influence divergent creativity differently: CoVe enhances it by promoting creative hypothesis generation, DoLa suppresses divergent thinking, potentially limiting creativity, while RAG has minimal effect on the creative output. The study highlights that the choice of hallucination-reduction method should depend on the specific scientific application, balancing the need for factual accuracy against the importance of creative exploration. These insights provide practical guidance for leveraging LLMs in scientific research where both precision and innovative thinking are necessary. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning, but suffer from hallucination: the generation of factually incorrect content. While numerous methods have been developed to reduce hallucinations, their impact on creative generations remains unexplored. This gap is particularly critical for AI-assisted scientific discovery, which requires both factual accuracy and creative hypothesis generation. We investigate how three hallucination-reduction techniques: Chain of Verification (CoVe), Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), affect creativity in LLMs. Evaluating multiple model families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral) at varying scales (1B - 70B parameters) on two creativity benchmarks (NeoCoder and CS4), we find that these methods have opposing effects on divergent creativity. CoVe enhances divergent thinking, DoLa suppresses it, and RAG shows minimal impact. Our findings provide guidance for selecting appropriate hallucination-reduction methods in scientific applications, where the balance between factual accuracy and creative exploration is crucial.

Abstract: Social media serves as a critical medium in modern politics because it both reflects politicians' ideologies and facilitates communication with younger generations. We present MultiParTweet, a multilingual tweet corpus from X that connects politicians' social media discourse with German political corpus GerParCor, thereby enabling comparative analyses between online communication and parliamentary debates. MultiParTweet contains 39 546 tweets, including 19 056 media items. Furthermore, we enriched the annotation with nine text-based models and one vision-language model (VLM) to annotate MultiParTweet with emotion, sentiment, and topic annotations. Moreover, the automated annotations are evaluated against a manually annotated subset. MultiParTweet can be reconstructed using our tool, TTLABTweetCrawler, which provides a framework for collecting data from X. To demonstrate a methodological demonstration, we examine whether the models can predict each other using the outputs of the remaining models. In summary, we provide MultiParTweet, a resource integrating automatic text and media-based annotations validated with human annotations, and TTLABTweetCrawler, a general-purpose X data collection tool. Our analysis shows that the models are mutually predictable. In addition, VLM-based annotation were preferred by human annotators, suggesting that multimodal representations align more with human interpretation.

<div> Keywords: auditing, black-box LLMs, input sensitivity, Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis, interpretability  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of auditing black-box large language models (LLMs), especially for critical applications in legal, medical, and regulatory domains where reliability is paramount. Unlike existing methods that focus on specific behaviors like bias detection or fairness evaluation, the authors seek a general understanding of how each input token influences the LLM's output. The core difficulty arises from LLMs being stochastic, yielding different outputs for the same input, and the impracticality of computing gradients at the prompt level to measure sensitivity. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a novel approach called Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA). This method is lightweight, model-agnostic, and does not rely on any distributional assumptions about the underlying LLM. DBSA provides practitioners with a practical, plug-and-play tool to quickly evaluate and visualize the sensitivity of model outputs to each input token. Through examples, the paper demonstrates that DBSA uncovers input-output dependencies that might be missed by existing interpretability techniques, thus improving the transparency and reliability assessment of black-box LLMs in real-world deployed settings. <div>
arXiv:2512.11573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of auditing black-box large language models (LLMs) to ensure they behave reliably when deployed in production settings, particularly in high-stakes domains such as legal, medical, and regulatory compliance. Existing approaches for LLM auditing often focus on isolated aspects of model behavior, such as detecting specific biases or evaluating fairness. We are interested in a more general question -- can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on each input token? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a practical tool for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how DBSA can enable users to inspect LLM inputs and find sensitivities that may be overlooked by existing LLM interpretability methods.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Merlin-Arthur Protocol, Explainability, Hallucination Reduction, Evaluation Metrics  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper presents a novel training framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models by treating the entire pipeline, including both the retriever and the generator, as an interactive proof system inspired by the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. In this setup, the generator LLM (Arthur) is trained using questions of unknown origin, where Merlin provides helpful, truthful evidence, and Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both characters utilize a linear-time explainable AI (XAI) method to identify and alter the evidence most influential to Arthur, enabling the model to learn to answer questions only when the evidence supports it, reject them when evidence is insufficient, and focus on the precise context spans that ground the answer. The authors introduce a rigorous evaluation framework that separates explanation fidelity from baseline prediction errors and propose the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), a metric that normalizes mutual-information guarantees adjusted for model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Experimental results across three RAG datasets and two different model families reveal that M/A-trained LLMs demonstrate improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, rejection behavior, and a significant reduction in hallucinations without requiring manually annotated unanswerable questions. Moreover, the retriever benefits from automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives, improving recall and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). This work suggests that autonomous interactive-proof supervision offers a principled and practical method to develop reliable RAG systems that treat retrieved documents as verifiable evidence rather than heuristic suggestions. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models rely on retrieved evidence to guide large language model (LLM) generators, yet current systems treat retrieval as a weak heuristic rather than verifiable evidence. As a result, LLMs answer without support, hallucinate under incomplete or misleading context, and rely on spurious evidence. We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions. The retriever likewise improves recall and MRR through automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. Our results demonstrate that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision provides a principled and practical path toward reliable RAG systems that treat retrieved documents not as suggestions, but as verifiable evidence.

<div> Keywords: BERTopic, historical newspapers, nuclear discourse, topic modeling, temporal evolution  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The article addresses the challenges of extracting coherent and interpretable themes from large, unstructured historical newspaper archives, where traditional topic modeling methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) often fall short due to topic evolution, OCR noise, and text volume. To overcome these limitations, the study employs BERTopic, a neural topic modeling approach based on transformer embeddings, which remains underutilized in historical research. Focusing on newspaper articles published between 1955 and 2018, the research specifically examines discourse surrounding nuclear power and nuclear safety. The study analyzes topic distributions over time, revealing long-term trends and shifts in public discourse, including the co-occurrence and changing prominence of themes related to nuclear power and nuclear weapons. This approach demonstrates BERTopic’s scalability and contextual sensitivity, providing richer insights compared to traditional methods. The findings contribute significantly to historical, nuclear, and social science research by enabling a deeper understanding of evolving public discourse in historical media. Finally, the article reflects on current methodological limitations and suggests directions for future research to further improve the analysis of historical text corpora. <div>

Abstract: Extracting coherent and human-understandable themes from large collections of unstructured historical newspaper archives presents significant challenges due to topic evolution, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) noise, and the sheer volume of text. Traditional topic-modeling methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), often fall short in capturing the complexity and dynamic nature of discourse in historical texts. To address these limitations, we employ BERTopic. This neural topic-modeling approach leverages transformerbased embeddings to extract and classify topics, which, despite its growing popularity, still remains underused in historical research. Our study focuses on articles published between 1955 and 2018, specifically examining discourse on nuclear power and nuclear safety. We analyze various topic distributions across the corpus and trace their temporal evolution to uncover long-term trends and shifts in public discourse. This enables us to more accurately explore patterns in public discourse, including the co-occurrence of themes related to nuclear power and nuclear weapons and their shifts in topic importance over time. Our study demonstrates the scalability and contextual sensitivity of BERTopic as an alternative to traditional approaches, offering richer insights into historical discourses extracted from newspaper archives. These findings contribute to historical, nuclear, and social-science research while reflecting on current limitations and proposing potential directions for future work.

<div> Speculative generation, large language models, parallelism, branching random walks, runtime bounds<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper investigates the limits of speedup achievable by deterministic speculative generation algorithms used to accelerate inference in large language models (LLMs). Speculative generation improves efficiency by allowing multiple draft tokens to be verified simultaneously using parallel processing. The authors establish the first tight lower bounds on the runtime performance of any deterministic speculative generation method. They achieve this by drawing an analogy between the token generation process and branching random walks, which leads to formulating and analyzing the optimal draft tree selection problem. Under reasonable assumptions, the authors prove that the expected number of tokens predicted per speculative iteration, \(\mathbb{E}[X]\), is bounded by an expression involving the verifier's capacity \(P\), the expected entropy \(\mu\), and the second log-moment \(\mu_{(2)}\): \(\mathbb{E}[X] \leq (\mu + \mu_{(2)}) \log(P) / \mu^2 + O(1)\). This theoretical result provides new fundamental insights into the limitations of parallel token generation. The paper further validates these theoretical bounds empirically on Llama models, showing strong agreement between practical performance and theoretical predictions. These findings offer valuable guidance for designing more efficient speculative decoding systems in future large-scale language model inference tasks. <div>

Abstract: Speculative generation has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate inference in large language models (LLMs) by leveraging parallelism to verify multiple draft tokens simultaneously. However, the fundamental limits on the achievable speedup remain poorly understood. In this work, we establish the first ``tight'' lower bounds on the runtime of any deterministic speculative generation algorithm. This is achieved by drawing a parallel between the token generation process and branching random walks, which allows us to analyze the optimal draft tree selection problem. We prove, under basic assumptions, that the expected number of tokens successfully predicted per speculative iteration is bounded as $\mathbb{E}[X] \leq (\mu + \mu_{(2)})\log(P )/\mu^2 + O(1)$, where $P$ is the verifier's capacity, $\mu$ is the expected entropy of the verifier's output distribution, and $\mu_{(2)}$ is the expected second log-moment. This result provides new insights into the limits of parallel token generation, and could guide the design of future speculative decoding systems. Empirical evaluations on Llama models validate our theoretical predictions, confirming the tightness of our bounds in practical settings.

<div> Keywords: personalized summarization, review alignment, reinforcement learning, Amazon dataset, user personas<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of noisy and overwhelming signals in online product reviews that impair effective user decision-making. 2. Existing large language model (LLM)-based summarizers are generic and do not tailor summaries according to individual user preferences, reducing their practical usefulness. 3. The proposed solution, SUMFORU, is a steerable review summarization framework designed to align summary outputs with explicit user personas to enable personalized purchase decisions. 4. SUMFORU incorporates a high-quality data pipeline built from the Amazon 2023 Review Dataset and employs a two-stage alignment process: (a) persona-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) via asymmetric knowledge distillation, and (b) Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) using a preference estimator to capture fine-grained, persona-relevant signals. 5. Evaluations conducted using rule-based, LLM-based, and human-centered metrics demonstrate that SUMFORU consistently improves summary consistency, grounding, and preferences alignment, outperforming baselines in all categories. 6. The framework generalizes effectively to unseen product categories, highlighting the potential of steerable pluralistic alignment approaches for building next-generation personalized decision-support systems. <div>

Abstract: Online product reviews contain rich but noisy signals that overwhelm users and hinder effective decision-making. Existing LLM-based summarizers remain generic and fail to account for individual preferences, limiting their practical utility. We propose SUMFORU, a steerable review summarization framework that aligns outputs with explicit user personas to support personalized purchase decisions. Our approach integrates a high-quality data pipeline built from the Amazon 2023 Review Dataset with a two-stage alignment procedure: (1) persona-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) via asymmetric knowledge distillation, and (2) Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) using a preference estimator to capture fine-grained, persona-relevant signals. We evaluate the model across rule-based, LLM-based, and human-centered metrics, demonstrating consistent improvements in consistency, grounding, and preference alignment. Our framework achieves the highest performance across all evaluation settings and generalizes effectively to unseen product categories. Our results highlight the promise of steerable pluralistic alignment for building next-generation personalized decision-support systems.

<div> Keywords: video generation, language modeling, Mixture-of-Transformers, text-video integration, controllability  

<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces TV2TV, a novel framework for video generation that integrates language modeling with video frame prediction to overcome challenges in creating complex, semantically rich videos. TV2TV operates by interleaving text and video generation, leveraging a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that simultaneously learns to predict the next language token and the next video frame. During inference, the model strategically alternates between generating descriptive text and visual frames, effectively allowing it to "think in words" before "acting in pixels," which enhances both the coherence and quality of video outputs. This text-driven control mechanism enables users to intervene via text prompts at any point, offering fine-grained influence over the generated video's trajectory. Experiments conducted on video game datasets demonstrate significant improvements in visual fidelity and controllability compared to existing approaches. The model's versatility is further validated by scaling it to natural videos, specifically sports footage augmented with natural language descriptions of actions, using vision-language models for annotation. Training on this diverse corpus enables TV2TV to generate realistic videos aligned with detailed textual prompts, showcasing its capacity for complex reasoning and actionable control. Overall, TV2TV represents a promising advancement toward video generation systems capable of open-ended textual reasoning and interactive guidance. <div>
arXiv:2512.05103v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video generation models are rapidly advancing, but can still struggle with complex video outputs that require significant semantic branching or repeated high-level reasoning about what should happen next. In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.

<div> backdoor attacks, language models, contextual triggers, SCOUT defense, token saliency  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the security risks posed by backdoor attacks on language models, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare, where hidden malicious triggers manipulate model behavior during inference. Traditional defenses are effective against conspicuous triggers but fail to detect sophisticated attacks employing contextually-appropriate triggers that blend naturally into domain-specific language. The authors introduce three novel contextually-aware attack scenarios—ViralApp (targeting social media addiction classification), Fever (manipulating medical diagnosis toward hypertension), and Referral (influencing clinical recommendations)—which leverage semantic plausibility and domain-specific vocabulary to evade detection. To combat both conventional and sophisticated backdoor threats, the paper proposes SCOUT (Saliency-based Classification Of Untrusted Tokens), a novel defense framework that uses token-level saliency analysis by measuring the impact of removing individual tokens on the model’s output logits for the target label. This saliency mapping approach enables identification of both obvious and subtle backdoor triggers regardless of their contextual fit. Evaluation on benchmark datasets including SST-2, IMDB, and AG News demonstrates that SCOUT effectively detects existing and newly introduced sophisticated backdoor attacks while maintaining high accuracy on clean, unmanipulated inputs, thereby offering a robust solution for securing language models against advanced adversarial threats. <div>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks create significant security threats to language models by embedding hidden triggers that manipulate model behavior during inference, presenting critical risks for AI systems deployed in healthcare and other sensitive domains. While existing defenses effectively counter obvious threats such as out-of-context trigger words and safety alignment violations, they fail against sophisticated attacks using contextually-appropriate triggers that blend seamlessly into natural language. This paper introduces three novel contextually-aware attack scenarios that exploit domain-specific knowledge and semantic plausibility: the ViralApp attack targeting social media addiction classification, the Fever attack manipulating medical diagnosis toward hypertension, and the Referral attack steering clinical recommendations. These attacks represent realistic threats where malicious actors exploit domain-specific vocabulary while maintaining semantic coherence, demonstrating how adversaries can weaponize contextual appropriateness to evade conventional detection methods. To counter both traditional and these sophisticated attacks, we present \textbf{SCOUT (Saliency-based Classification Of Untrusted Tokens)}, a novel defense framework that identifies backdoor triggers through token-level saliency analysis rather than traditional context-based detection methods. SCOUT constructs a saliency map by measuring how the removal of individual tokens affects the model's output logits for the target label, enabling detection of both conspicuous and subtle manipulation attempts. We evaluate SCOUT on established benchmark datasets (SST-2, IMDB, AG News) against conventional attacks (BadNet, AddSent, SynBkd, StyleBkd) and our novel attacks, demonstrating that SCOUT successfully detects these sophisticated threats while preserving accuracy on clean inputs.

<div> Scaling test-time computation, multi-agent systems, compute allocation, collaboration modules, dual-level planning  

<br /><br />Summary: Recent advances show that increasing test-time computation improves large language model performance without retraining. Techniques like repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection allocate more inference-time compute to enhance task success. However, these methods are hard to implement across multiple agents due to a lack of mechanisms for collaborative compute allocation under budget constraints. To address this, the paper introduces FutureWeaver, a framework designed to optimize test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems with fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, where reusable multi-agent workflows are encapsulated as callable functions. These collaboration modules are automatically extracted through self-play reflection, which abstracts common interaction patterns from previous agent trajectories. The framework employs a dual-level planning architecture that plans compute allocation by considering the current task state and anticipating future steps. Experimental results on complex multi-agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms existing baselines across a variety of budget settings. This validates its effectiveness in optimizing collaborative inference-time compute allocation and enhancing multi-agent system performance. <div>

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves large language model performance without additional training. Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.

<div> Adaptive Soft Rolling KV Freeze with Entropy-Guided Recovery (ASR-KF-EGR), KV cache, inference-time optimization, large language models, memory-efficient generation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper introduces ASR-KF-EGR, a training-free, inference-time framework designed to efficiently manage large language model (LLM) generation by optimizing the key-value (KV) cache. The core innovation is a reversible soft-freeze mechanism that temporarily halts KV updates for tokens deemed low-importance within a sliding attention window, identified via entropy-guided recovery. Unlike existing eviction methods that permanently discard context tokens, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on-demand, maintaining full context availability. The framework incorporates sublinear freeze scheduling, meaning that the duration of KV freezing increases sublinearly with repeated detections of low-importance tokens, which prevents over-aggressive compression and degradation of generation quality. Experimental results on the LLaMA-3 8B model reveal that the approach reduces active KV cache size by 55-67% while preserving the quality of generated text and successfully passing challenging needle-in-haystack retrieval tests. ASR-KF-EGR is architecture-agnostic, requires no model fine-tuning, and offers a practical memory-saving solution for deploying long-context LLMs in resource-constrained environments. <div>

<div> Keywords: molecular toxicity prediction, multi-task learning, chemical language model, sparse attention, interpretability<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of reliable and interpretable in silico molecular toxicity prediction, which is crucial for accelerating drug discovery while reducing experimental costs. The authors introduce a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework that improves both prediction accuracy and model interpretability by combining a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. To encourage focus on meaningful molecular features, they apply an L1 sparsity penalty on the attention layers, which forces the model to select a minimal and relevant set of molecular fragments for each toxicity endpoint. This design enables the framework to be trained end-to-end and easily adapted to various transformer-based backbone architectures. The proposed method is rigorously evaluated on three benchmark datasets—ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21—demonstrating consistent performance gains over single-task models and conventional MTL baselines. Of particular importance, the sparse attention weights serve as a direct and intuitive visualization tool, highlighting the molecular fragments that drive each toxicity prediction. This advances the interpretability of black-box models by providing chemically meaningful insights into their decision-making process, thereby enhancing trust and practical usefulness in high-stakes safety assessments. <div>

Abstract: Reliable in silico molecular toxicity prediction is a cornerstone of modern drug discovery, offering a scalable alternative to experimental screening. However, the black-box nature of state-of-the-art models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as high-stakes safety decisions demand verifiable structural insights alongside predictive performance. To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process.

<div> Keywords: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, Plasticity-Ceiling Framework, Expert Trajectories, Post-Training Scaling<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper introduces the Plasticity-Ceiling Framework, a theoretical approach to understanding the integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in post-training, decomposing overall performance into foundational SFT results and subsequent RL adaptability (plasticity).<br /><br />2. Benchmarking results show that a sequential pipeline, applying SFT first and then RL, outperforms synchronized methods by providing greater stability during training.<br /><br />3. The authors derive clear scaling guidelines: beginning RL training at the SFT Stable or Mild Overfitting Sub-phase maximizes the total achievable performance ceiling, balancing solid foundational SFT performance with preserved RL plasticity.<br /><br />4. Contradicting the "Less is More" hypothesis in combined SFT-then-RL scaling, the study finds that the scale of data is the main driver of post-training potential, while the difficulty of the expert trajectories acts as a performance multiplier.<br /><br />5. Finally, they identify that the minimum SFT validation loss is a reliable metric for selecting expert trajectories that will maximize the final performance ceiling, providing practical guidance for leveraging expert data most effectively. <div>

Abstract: While effective post-training integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), the optimal mechanism for utilizing expert trajectories remains unresolved. We propose the Plasticity-Ceiling Framework to theoretically ground this landscape, decomposing performance into foundational SFT performance and the subsequent RL plasticity. Through extensive benchmarking, we establish the Sequential SFT-then-RL pipeline as the superior standard, overcoming the stability deficits of synchronized approaches. Furthermore, we derive precise scaling guidelines: (1) Transitioning to RL at the SFT Stable or Mild Overfitting Sub-phase maximizes the final ceiling by securing foundational SFT performance without compromising RL plasticity; (2) Refuting ``Less is More'' in the context of SFT-then-RL scaling, we demonstrate that Data Scale determines the primary post-training potential, while Trajectory Difficulty acts as a performance multiplier; and (3) Identifying that the Minimum SFT Validation Loss serves as a robust indicator for selecting the expert trajectories that maximize the final performance ceiling. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for maximizing the value extracted from expert trajectories.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: key frame selection, task-adaptive, Chain-of-Thought, multimodal features, mutual learning<br /><br />Summary: Traditional top-K key frame selection methods in video understanding score frames independently, often resulting in temporally clustered and visually redundant frames. To overcome these challenges, the paper introduces an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework that dynamically optimizes frame selection for specific tasks. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to score frames contextually. The framework employs a continuous set-level objective function integrating relevance, coverage, and redundancy, allowing differentiable optimization through Gumbel-Softmax for optimal set-level frame combination. Unlike prior methods relying on static pseudo labels from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this approach implements student-teacher mutual learning, aligning the SLM (student selector) and MLLM (teacher reasoner) through KL divergence and cross-entropy loss. This enables dynamic adaptation of the supervisory signal according to task objectives during training, supporting end-to-end optimization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks—Video-MME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and NExT-QA—demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing frame selection techniques in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, validating its effectiveness in diverse video understanding scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Key frame selection in video understanding presents significant challenges. Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level. Finally, student-teacher mutual learning is employed, where the student selector (SLM) and teacher reasoner (MLLM) are trained to align their frame importance distributions via KL divergence. Combined with cross-entropy loss, this enables end-to-end optimization, eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels. Experiments across various benchmarks, including Video-MME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and NExT-QA, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

<div> Keywords: DentalGPT, Multimodal Large Language Models, Dentistry, Reinforcement Learning, Disease Classification<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. DentalGPT is a domain-specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed specifically for dental applications to improve automated oral healthcare.<br /><br />2. The model was trained on the largest annotated multimodal dental dataset to date, containing over 120,000 dental images paired with detailed diagnostic descriptions that emphasize relevant visual features.<br /><br />3.

Evaluation on intraoral, panoramic dental benchmarks, and subsets of medical visual question answering (VQA) tasks demonstrates that DentalGPT outperforms many state-of-the-art MLLMs, despite using only 7 billion parameters, thus proving that high-quality domain data combined with staged adaptation is effective for building specialized dental MLLMs. <div>

Abstract: Reliable interpretation of multimodal data in dentistry is essential for automated oral healthcare, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained dental visual details and lack sufficient reasoning ability for precise diagnosis. To address these limitations, we present DentalGPT, a specialized dental MLLM developed through high-quality domain knowledge injection and reinforcement learning. Specifically, the largest annotated multimodal dataset for dentistry to date was constructed by aggregating over 120k dental images paired with detailed descriptions that highlight diagnostically relevant visual features, making it the multimodal dataset with the most extensive collection of dental images to date. Training on this dataset significantly enhances the MLLM's visual understanding of dental conditions, while the subsequent reinforcement learning stage further strengthens its capability for multimodal complex reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on intraoral and panoramic benchmarks, along with dental subsets of medical VQA benchmarks, show that DentalGPT achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters. These results demonstrate that high-quality dental data combined with staged adaptation provides an effective pathway for building capable and domain-specialized dental MLLMs.

<div> Voice-based AI, Conversation, Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Interactional Friction, Modular Design<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper investigates the interactional challenges present in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) systems, which, despite their advanced generative capabilities, often produce conversational interactions that feel disrupted. First, it identifies three key patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where delays caused by the system disrupt the expected natural rhythm of conversation, frustrating users; (2) Expressive Flattening, in which the loss of paralinguistic signals such as tone and emotion leads to responses that are overly literal and sometimes inappropriate; (3) Repair Rigidity, where the system’s architectural design restricts users from easily correcting errors in real-time, limiting conversational fluidity. The study argues that these issues should not be treated as mere technical defects or failures but as inherent structural outcomes stemming from a modular design approach that prioritizes control and modularity over conversational fluidity. Finally, the authors conclude that achieving natural spoken AI interaction requires rethinking infrastructure, emphasizing seamless integration and choreography between system components rather than optimizing individual modules in isolation. This shift would better support natural conversational flow and user experience in voice-based AI systems. <div>

Abstract: While voice-based AI systems have achieved remarkable generative capabilities, their interactions often feel conversationally broken. This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity. We conclude that building natural spoken AI is an infrastructure design challenge, requiring a shift from optimizing isolated components to carefully choreographing the seams between them.

<br /><br />Summary: This work addresses the significant singability gap between machine-generated lyrics and those created by humans in the task of melody-to-lyric generation. The researchers propose a model that learns both the wording and formatting aspects of lyrics jointly to improve singability. Initially, the model undergoes general-domain pretraining, followed by a self-supervised training stage on a large text-only lyric corpus to acquire length awareness. During the supervised melody-to-lyric training phase, the model is guided by multiple auxiliary supervision objectives derived from musicological insights about the relationships between melody and lyrics. These objectives help the model capture detailed prosodic and structural patterns essential for singable lyrics. Experimental results show the approach surpasses naive fine-tuning methods by improving adherence to line-count and syllable-count constraints by 3.8% and 21.4% respectively, without reducing text quality. Human evaluations demonstrate a 42.2% and 74.2% relative improvement in overall lyric quality compared to two task-specific baseline models. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating formatting-aware training strategies to effectively generate lyrics that are more singable and musically coherent. <div>

Abstract: Despite progress in melody-to-lyric generation, a substantial singability gap remains between machine-generated lyrics and those written by human lyricists. In this work, we aim to narrow this gap by jointly learning both wording and formatting for melody-to-lyric generation. After general-domain pretraining, our model acquires length awareness through an self-supervised stage trained on a large text-only lyric corpus. During supervised melody-to-lyric training, we introduce multiple auxiliary supervision objective informed by musicological findings on melody--lyric relationships, encouraging the model to capture fine-grained prosodic and structural patterns. Compared with na\"ive fine-tuning, our approach improves adherence to line-count and syllable-count requirements by 3.8% and 21.4% absolute, respectively, without degrading text quality. In human evaluation, it achieves 42.2% and 74.2% relative gains in overall quality over two task-specific baselines, underscoring the importance of formatting-aware training for generating singable lyrics.

This paper presents M3-Embedding, an innovative embedding model characterized by its versatility in multilinguality, multi-functionality, and multi-granularity. The model supports semantic retrieval across more than 100 working languages, ensuring extensive multilingual coverage. It unifies three common retrieval functionalities—dense retrieval, multi-vector retrieval, and sparse retrieval—within a single framework, enabling flexible application scenarios. Additionally, M3-Embedding handles inputs of varying granularities, ranging from short sentences to lengthy documents up to 8,192 tokens, accommodating different types of textual data. The paper introduces several technical contributions for effective training, notably a novel self-knowledge distillation method which integrates relevance scores from different retrieval functionalities to serve as a teacher signal that enhances training quality. Furthermore, an optimized batching strategy is proposed to support large batch sizes and improve training throughput, thereby increasing the discriminative power of the embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that M3-Embedding achieves superior performance and sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks in multilingual, cross-lingual, and long-document retrieval tasks. These advances showcase the model's broad applicability and effectiveness in complex retrieval scenarios. <div>

<div> SSMs, transformers, language modeling, state tracking, hierarchical structure  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of linear state space models (SSMs) in the context of language modeling, comparing their capacities with those of transformers and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). First, it highlights that SSMs and transformers possess overlapping yet distinct strengths in representational power. Second, SSMs excel at star-free state tracking by offering straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers find difficult to represent exactly. Third, SSMs are capable of modeling bounded hierarchical structures with optimal memory efficiency, even without resorting to stack simulation. Fourth, the authors identify a specific design choice in contemporary SSMs that restricts their expressive power, suggesting room for architectural improvements. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed for future research in SSM-based language modeling, and the theoretical insights are empirically validated using a recent SSM architecture named Mamba. This study advances the theoretical understanding of SSMs and provides guidance towards more effective LM architectures that may leverage the unique properties of these models. <div>

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models based on linear state space models (SSMs) have shown promising performance in language modeling (LM), competititve with transformers. However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.

<title>Dynamics of Spontaneous Topic Changes in Next Token Prediction with Self-Attention</title>

<div> Keywords: spontaneous thought, self-attention, token priority graphs, topic change, large language models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper investigates the phenomenon of spontaneous topic shifts in human cognition and contrasts it with the behavior of self-attention based models, particularly large language models (LLMs). First, the authors define topics through Token Priority Graphs (TPGs) within a simplified single-layer self-attention framework and prove key theoretical properties: the model preserves the priority order of tokens associated with an input topic; spontaneous topic changes can only happen if lower-priority tokens surpass all higher-priority tokens within the topic; and unlike humans, increased context length or topic ambiguity actually decreases the chance of spontaneous topic change in these models. Second, these theoretical insights are empirically verified in state-of-the-art LLMs, confirming that the identified dynamics hold beyond the simplified model. The results reveal a fundamental difference between AI models and human cognition in terms of how and when spontaneous topic changes occur. Finally, the study highlights that prior research has not closely examined spontaneous topic dynamics from this cognitive perspective, positioning this work as a novel contribution to understanding the intersection of human thought processes and AI behavior. <div>

Abstract: Human cognition is punctuated by abrupt, spontaneous shifts between topics-driven by emotional, contextual, or associative cues-a phenomenon known as spontaneous thought in neuroscience. In contrast, self-attention based models depend on structured patterns over their inputs to predict each next token, lacking spontaneity. Motivated by this distinction, we characterize spontaneous topic changes in self-attention architectures, revealing both their similarities and their divergences from spontaneous human thought. First, we establish theoretical results under a simplified, single-layer self-attention model with suitable conditions by defining the topic as a set of Token Priority Graphs (TPGs). Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the priority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a spontaneous topic change can occur only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority tokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, the longer context length or the more ambiguous input topic reduces the likelihood of spontaneous change. Second, we empirically validate that these dynamics persist in modern, state-of-the-art LLMs, underscoring a fundamental disparity between human cognition and AI behaviour in the context of spontaneous topic changes. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored these questions with a focus as closely aligned to human thought.

Abstract: This project aims to optimize the linguistic indexing of the OpenAlex database by comparing the performance of various Python-based language identification procedures on different metadata corpora extracted from a manually-annotated article sample. The precision and recall performance of each algorithm, corpus, and language is first analyzed, followed by an assessment of processing speeds recorded for each algorithm and corpus type. These different performance measures are then simulated at the database level using probabilistic confusion matrices for each algorithm, corpus, and language, as well as a probabilistic modeling of relative article language frequencies for the whole OpenAlex database. Results show that procedure performance strongly depends on the importance given to each of the measures implemented: for contexts where precision is preferred, using the LangID algorithm on the greedy corpus gives the best results; however, for all cases where recall is considered at least slightly more important than precision or as soon as processing times are given any kind of consideration, the procedure that consists in the application of the FastSpell algorithm on the Titles corpus outperforms all other alternatives. Given the lack of truly multilingual large-scale bibliographic databases, it is hoped that these results help confirm and foster the unparalleled potential of the OpenAlex database for cross-linguistic and comprehensive measurement and evaluation.

<div> Calibration, Large Language Models, Distractor Prompts, Question Answering, RLHF  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates calibration issues in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the mismatch between predicted confidence and actual correctness in critical decision-making. It evaluates nine LLMs across three factual Question-Answering datasets, comparing the standard free-generation setting with structured distractor-augmented prompting. Incorporating distractors significantly improves calibration, yielding up to 460% relative accuracy gains and reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by up to 90%. Despite overall trends, large Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)-tuned models show inherent calibration strengths but may experience increased miscalibration on easier queries. Smaller models, while benefiting more from distractor prompts in terms of calibration, still remain substantially miscalibrated. Further analysis reveals persistent calibration difficulties, especially in person-based question types. The study concludes with practical recommendations for improving LLM calibration: targeted fine-tuning, using structured prompts with distractors, and selecting models strategically based on their calibration behavior. These insights aim to promote reliable and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in sensitive applications. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable proficiency in natural language tasks, yet their frequent overconfidence-misalignment between predicted confidence and true correctness-poses significant risks in critical decision-making applications. We present a comprehensive analysis on calibration in LLMs across nine LLMs and three factual Question-Answering (QA) datasets, systematically comparing standard free-generation settings against structured distractor-augmented prompts. Our evaluation reveals that explicitly incorporating distractors can substantially mitigate miscalibration, achieving relative accuracy improvements up to 460% and ECE reductions up to 90%. Despite general trends, we uncover nuanced findings: large RLHF-tuned models display inherent calibration strengths but can paradoxically suffer increased miscalibration on easier queries, whereas smaller models benefit disproportionately from distractor prompts but remain significantly miscalibrated. Through detailed analyses across question types, we identify persistent calibration failures, particularly in person-based queries. We conclude with concrete recommendations-targeted fine-tuning, structured prompting, and strategic model choice-to ensure reliable, trustworthy LLM deployments.

<div> Best-of-N, self-certainty, large language models, reasoning performance, open-ended tasks<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces self-certainty, a novel metric designed to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by efficiently evaluating response quality using the internal probability distribution of outputs, without relying on costly external reward models. 1) The authors identify that existing best-of-N selection techniques commonly depend on reward models or reward-free methods like self-consistency, which have limitations in handling open-ended tasks and scaling. 2) Self-certainty estimates confidence by aggregating distributional certainty across multiple generated samples, hypothesized to correlate with response accuracy. 3) Experimental results across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that self-certainty effectively scales with sample size N, matching the performance trends of reward models but without the computational expense. 4) It synergizes well with chain-of-thought prompting techniques, further boosting reasoning performance beyond simple greedy decoding. 5) Additionally, self-certainty generalizes better to open-ended generation tasks where traditional self-consistency approaches often struggle. The study thus positions self-certainty as a practical, scalable, and efficient method for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities. The authors also provide publicly available code for replication and further research. <div>

Abstract: Best-of-N selection is a key technique for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through increased test-time computation. Current state-of-the-art methods often employ computationally intensive reward models for response evaluation and selection. Reward-free alternatives, like self-consistency and universal self-consistency, are limited in their ability to handle open-ended generation tasks or scale effectively. To address these limitations, we propose self-certainty, a novel and efficient metric that leverages the inherent probability distribution of LLM outputs to estimate response quality without requiring external reward models. We hypothesize that higher distributional self-certainty, aggregated across multiple samples, correlates with improved response accuracy, as it reflects greater confidence in the generated output. Through extensive experiments on various reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that self-certainty (1) scales effectively with increasing sample size N, akin to reward models but without the computational overhead; (2) complements chain-of-thought, improving reasoning performance beyond greedy decoding; and (3) generalizes to open-ended tasks where traditional self-consistency methods fall short. Our findings establish self-certainty as a practical and efficient way for improving LLM reasoning capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/backprop07/Self-Certainty

<div> Keywords: proteins, language of life, evolutionary units, PUMA, mutation-aware merging<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Proteins are fundamental biological molecules composed of amino acid chains that can be analyzed like a language, with the twenty standard residues acting as an alphabet. The study focuses on identifying fundamental intermediate units in this "language of life," analogous to words in human language, situated between single residues and larger protein domains. These units are hypothesized to inherently reflect evolutionary relationships because protein diversity arises from evolutionary processes. To discover these evolutionarily meaningful units, the authors present PUMA (Protein Units via Mutation-Aware Merging), an iterative merging algorithm guided by substitution matrices that groups protein sequences into families connected through plausible mutations. PUMA produces a hierarchical genealogical structure featuring parent units and mutational variants while generating both a vocabulary of units and their genealogical connections. Biological validation shows that PUMA families correspond with clinically benign variants and high-scoring mutations in functional assays, indicating their biological relevance. Moreover, the units discovered align well with the contextual preferences of protein language models and correspond to established functional protein annotations. Overall, PUMA offers a structured, evolutionarily informed framework for understanding protein sequences and their functional evolution, advancing the conceptualization of protein language. <div>

Abstract: Proteins are the essential drivers of biological processes. At the molecular level, they are chains of amino acids that can be viewed through a linguistic lens where the twenty standard residues serve as an alphabet combining to form a complex language, referred to as the language of life. To understand this language, we must first identify its fundamental units. Analogous to words, these units are hypothesized to represent an intermediate layer between single residues and larger domains. Crucially, just as protein diversity arises from evolution, these units should inherently reflect evolutionary relationships. We introduce PUMA (Protein Units via Mutation-Aware Merging) to discover these evolutionarily meaningful units. PUMA employs an iterative merging algorithm guided by substitution matrices to identify protein units and organize them into families linked by plausible mutations. This process creates a hierarchical genealogy where parent units and their mutational variants coexist, simultaneously producing a unit vocabulary and the genealogical structure connecting them. We validate that PUMA families are biologically meaningful; mutations within a PUMA family correlate with clinically benign variants and with high-scoring mutations in high-throughput assays. Furthermore, these units align with the contextual preferences of protein language models and map to known functional annotations. PUMA's genealogical framework provides evolutionarily grounded units, offering a structured approach for understanding the language of life.

<div> Large multimodal models, vision-language tasks, grounding instructions, MOAT benchmark, model evaluation<br /><br />Summary: Large multimodal models (LMMs) show promise as versatile generalists in vision-language (VL) tasks but struggle with tasks requiring combined VL capabilities and grounding of complex textual or visual instructions. To address this, the authors introduce MOAT, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 1005 challenging real-world vision questions designed to be easy for humans but difficult for LMMs. MOAT evaluates nine distinct VL capabilities, including text reading, counting, spatial reasoning, and instruction grounding, offering a detailed analysis of model strengths and weaknesses. Significantly, MOAT is the first benchmark to explicitly assess LMMs’ ability to ground elaborate text and visual instructions, a critical skill for practical applications. The study evaluates 17 major proprietary and open-source LMMs, with the top model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving only 44% accuracy—insufficient for real-world deployment. The authors analyze performance trends, highlighting text-centric reasoning challenges, identifying VL capabilities that act as bottlenecks in complex tasks, and discussing negative impacts caused by common processing techniques like tiling. The benchmark’s resources, including code and data, are publicly accessible for advancing future research and model improvements at https://cambrian-yzt.github.io/MOAT/. <div>

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential as generalists in vision-language (VL) tasks. However, adoption of LMMs in real-world tasks is hindered by their poor performance in tasks that require a combination of VL capabilities, as well as in tasks that involve the grounding of complex text or visual instructions. To thoroughly investigate this gap and its underlying causes, we propose MOAT, a diverse benchmark with 1005 complex real-world vision questions that are straightforward for humans but challenging for LMMs. Specifically, the tasks in MOAT require LMMs to engage in generalist problem solving by integrating VL capabilities such as reading text, counting, understanding spatial relations, grounding textual and visual instructions, etc. All these abilities fit into a taxonomy proposed by us that contains 9 VL capabilities, enabling MOAT to provide a fine-grained view of LMMs' strengths and weaknesses. Besides, MOAT is the first benchmark to explicitly evaluate LMMs' ability to ground complex text and visual instructions, which is essential for many real-world applications. We evaluated 17 proprietary and open source LMMs, finding that the best performing LMM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieved only 44% accuracy, far below what would be acceptable in real-world applications. To guide future model development, we analyze common trends in our results and discuss the underlying causes of poor performance, focusing on the impact of text-centric reasoning, which VL capabilities form bottlenecks in complex tasks, and the potential harmful effects of tiling. Code and data are available at https://cambrian-yzt.github.io/MOAT/.

<div> Keywords: sentence structure balance, ASCII codes, PCA, normality tests, text quality evaluation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study addresses the challenge of analyzing sentence structure balance (usage of nouns, verbs, determiners, etc.) in natural language processing without relying on traditional syntactic tools like parts-of-speech tagging. It introduces a novel statistical method that uses ASCII codes to represent texts from 11 diverse corpora. These texts are then compressed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to examine their lexical category alignment. The method’s results are analyzed through histograms and normality tests including the Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling tests. By focusing on ASCII codes, the approach simplifies the process of text analysis, complementing rather than replacing conventional syntactic tools, while being resource-efficient. An example application on a text generated by an AI model named Grok shows near normality in sentence structure, indicating balanced outputs. Among the other ten corpora, four also pass the normality tests, implying varied balance in sentence structures across datasets. The paper concludes by suggesting further research to explore applications in text quality evaluation and style analysis, possibly integrating syntactic information for broader NLP tasks. This method provides a new perspective for assessing text balance using statistical and computationally light tools. <div>

Abstract: While utilizing syntactic tools such as parts-of-speech (POS) tagging has helped us understand sentence structures and their distribution across diverse corpora, it is quite complex and poses a challenge in natural language processing (NLP). This study focuses on understanding sentence structure balance - usages of nouns, verbs, determiners, etc - harmoniously without relying on such tools. It proposes a novel statistical method that uses American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) codes to represent text of 11 text corpora from various sources and their lexical category alignment after using their compressed versions through PCA, and analyzes the results through histograms and normality tests such as Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling Tests. By focusing on ASCII codes, this approach simplifies text processing, although not replacing any syntactic tools but complementing them by offering it as a resource-efficient tool for assessing text balance. The story generated by Grok shows near normality indicating balanced sentence structures in LLM outputs, whereas 4 out of the remaining 10 pass the normality tests. Further research could explore potential applications in text quality evaluation and style analysis with syntactic integration for more broader tasks.

<title>Uncertainty Distillation: Teaching Language Models to Express Semantic Confidence</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for factual question-answering, it becomes more important for LLMs to have the capability to communicate the likelihood that their answer is correct. For these verbalized expressions of uncertainty to be meaningful, they should reflect the error rates at the expressed level of confidence. However, when prompted to express confidence, the error rates of current LLMs are inconsistent with their communicated confidences, highlighting the need for uncertainty quantification methods. Many prior methods calculate lexical uncertainty, estimating a model's confidence in the specific string it generated. In some cases, however, it may be more useful to estimate semantic uncertainty, or the model's confidence in the answer regardless of how it is verbalized. We propose a simple procedure, uncertainty distillation, to teach an LLM to verbalize calibrated semantic confidences. Using held-out data to map initial uncertainty estimates to meaningful probabilities, we create examples annotated with verbalized probabilities for supervised fine-tuning. We find that our method yields verbalized confidences that correlate well with observed error rates, even when compared to strong baselines, some of which are more than twenty times slower at inference time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can be applied to black-box models that allow API-based fine-tuning, resulting in estimates of uncertainty that are both more effective and more efficient than any of our baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit position bias systematically underweighting information based on its location in the context but how this bias varies across languages and models remains unclear. We conduct a multilingual study across five typologically diverse languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi, Vietnamese) and five model architectures, analyzing how position bias interacts with prompting strategies and affects output entropy. Our key findings are: (1) Position bias is primarily model-driven but shows language-specific nuances. Notably, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, DeepSeek 7B Chat and Mistral 7B consistently favor late positions challenging the common assumption of universal early-token preference. (2) Explicitly instructing the model, in the presence of irrelevant distractors, that "the most relevant context to the query is marked as 1" unexpectedly reduces accuracy across all languages, questioning standard prompt-engineering practices. (3) Accuracy consistently drops most when relevant information appears in the middle of the context, yet this is not reflected in a corresponding increase in output entropy, suggesting the model remains confident even when it fails to use mid-context cues.

Built around a standardized \texttt{Dialog} representation, SDialog provides: (1) persona-driven multi-agent simulation with composable orchestration for controlled, synthetic dialog generation, (2) comprehensive evaluation combining linguistic metrics, LLM-as-a-judge and functional correctness validators, (3) mechanistic interpretability tools for activation inspection and steering via feature ablation and induction, and (4) audio generation with full acoustic simulation including 3D room modeling and microphone effects. The toolkit integrates with all major LLM backends, enabling mixed-backend experiments under a unified API. By coupling generation, evaluation, and interpretability in a dialog-centric architecture, SDialog enables researchers to build, benchmark and understand conversational systems more systematically.

Abstract: Little research explores the correlation between the expressive ability and generalization ability of the low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat minima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not been fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically seek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose Flat Minima LoRA (FMLoRA) and its efficient version, i.e., EFMLoRA, to seek flat minima for LoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full parameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach eliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across multiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large language models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFMLoRA achieves optimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining comparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with RoBERTa-large, EFMLoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and 0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models, e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat, there are performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on the SQA and VizWiz datasets, respectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of LoRA is closely related to sharpness, which is omitted by previous methods.

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines, in terms of plan preference. We further demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable component for improving agentic planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

<title>Mirror Speculative Decoding: Breaking the Serial Barrier in LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation: increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods (Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics, we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to 66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving 2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

<title>Textual Self-attention Network: Test-Time Preference Optimization through Textual Gradient-based Attention</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities, but aligning their outputs with human preferences typically requires expensive supervised fine-tuning. Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with reliably generating highly structured outputs, such as program code, mathematical formulas, or well-formed markup. Constrained decoding approaches mitigate this problem by greedily restricting what tokens an LLM can output at each step to guarantee that the output matches a given constraint. Specifically, in grammar-constrained decoding (GCD), the LLM's output must follow a given grammar. In this paper, we demonstrate that GCD techniques (and in general constrained decoding techniques) can distort the LLM's distribution, leading to outputs that are grammatical but appear with likelihoods that are not proportional to the ones given by the LLM, and so ultimately are low-quality. We call the problem of aligning sampling with a grammar constraint, grammar-aligned decoding (GAD), and propose adaptive sampling with approximate expected futures (ASAp), a decoding algorithm that guarantees the output to be grammatical while provably producing outputs that match the conditional probability of the LLM's distribution conditioned on the given grammar constraint. Our algorithm uses prior sample outputs to soundly overapproximate the future grammaticality of different output prefixes. Our evaluation on code generation and structured NLP tasks shows how ASAp often produces outputs with higher likelihood (according to the LLM's distribution) than existing GCD techniques, while still enforcing the desired grammatical constraints.

Abstract: Continual Instruction Tuning (CIT) is adopted to continually instruct Large Models to follow human intent data by data. It is observed that existing gradient update would heavily destroy the performance on previous datasets during CIT process. Instead, Exponential Moving Average (EMA), owns the ability to trace previous parameters, which can aid in decreasing forgetting. Nonetheless, its stable balance weight fails to deal with the ever-changing datasets, leading to the out-of-balance between plasticity and stability. In this paper, we propose a general continual instruction tuning framework to address the challenge. Starting from the trade-off prerequisite and EMA update, we propose the plasticity and stability ideal condition. Based on Taylor expansion in the loss function, we find the optimal balance weight can be automatically determined by the gradients and learned parameters. Therefore, we propose a stable-plasticity balanced coefficient to avoid knowledge interference. Based on the semantic similarity of the instructions, we can determine whether to retrain or expand the training parameters and allocate the most suitable parameters for the testing instances. Extensive experiments across multiple continual instruction tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only enhances anti-forgetting capabilities but also significantly improves overall continual tuning performance.

<title>Counterfactual Segmentation Reasoning: Diagnosing and Mitigating Pixel-Grounding Hallucination</title>

Abstract: Segmentation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly advanced grounded visual understanding, yet they remain prone to pixel-grounding hallucinations, producing masks for incorrect objects or for objects that are entirely absent. Existing evaluations rely almost entirely on text- or label-based perturbations, which check only whether the predicted mask matches the queried label. Such evaluations overlook the spatial footprint and severity of hallucination and therefore fail to reveal vision-driven hallucinations, which are more challenging and more prevalent. To address this gap, we formalize the task of Counterfactual Segmentation Reasoning (CSR), where a model must segment the referenced object in the factual image and abstain in its counterfactual counterpart. To support this task, we curate HalluSegBench, the first large-scale benchmark to diagnose referring and reasoning expression segmentation hallucinations using controlled visual counterfactuals, alongside new evaluation metrics that measure hallucination severity and disentangle vision- and language-driven failure modes. We further introduce RobustSeg, a segmentation VLM trained with counterfactual fine-tuning (CFT) to learn when to segment and when to abstain. Experimental results confirm RobustSeg reduces hallucinations by 30%, while improving segmentation performance on FP-RefCOCO(+/g).

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the framework performs biomedical data retrieval, literature-grounded question answering via retrieval-augmented generation, molecular generation, multi-property prediction, property-aware molecular refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. The agent autonomously retrieved relevant biomolecular information, including FASTA sequences, SMILES representations, and literature, and answered mechanistic questions with improved contextual accuracy compared to standard LLMs. It then generated chemically diverse seed molecules and predicted 75 properties, including ADMET-related and general physicochemical descriptors, which guided iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55. The number of molecules satisfying empirical drug-likeness filters also rose; for example, compliance with the Ghose filter increased from 32 to 55 within a pool of 100 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models, providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication, training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization. In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction, membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while highlighting open challenges in balancing the need to minimize harmful memorization with model utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

Abstract: Optimizing queries for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems poses a significant challenge, particularly across diverse modal indices. We introduce RL-QR, a novel annotation-free reinforcement learning framework for query rewriting that eliminates the need for costly human-annotated data. By leveraging verifiable search rewards derived from index-aligned synthetic queries, RL-QR overcomes human-annotation dependencies, extending its applicability to various modalities and index domains. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's robustness, achieving substantial retrieval performance gains of up to 3.9$\times$ on lexical retrievers and 3.5$\times$ on semantic retrievers on the MTEB VIDORE V2 benchmark for unstructured visual documents, along with consistent 5\% to 10\% improvements on MS MARCO v2.1 and internal industrial datasets.

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) has emerged to prominence in response to the growing demand for educational automation. Providing an objective and cost-effective solution, AES standardises the assessment of extended responses. Although substantial research has been conducted in this domain, recent investigations reveal that alternative deep-learning architectures outperform transformer-based models. Despite the successful dominance in the performance of the transformer architectures across various other tasks, this discrepancy has prompted a need to enrich transformer-based AES models through contextual enrichment.
  This study delves into diverse contextual factors using the ASAP-AES dataset, analysing their impact on transformer-based model performance. Our most effective model, augmented with multiple contextual dimensions, achieves a mean Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.823 across the entire essay dataset and 0.8697 when trained on individual essay sets. Evidently surpassing prior transformer-based models, this augmented approach only underperforms relative to the state-of-the-art deep learning model trained essay-set-wise by an average of 3.83\% while exhibiting superior performance in three of the eight sets.
  Importantly, this enhancement is orthogonal to architecture-based advancements and seamlessly adaptable to any AES model. Consequently, this contextual augmentation methodology presents a versatile technique for refining AES capabilities, contributing to automated grading and evaluation evolution in educational settings.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of medical benchmarks. Yet underneath the seemingly promising results lie salient growth areas, especially in cutting-edge frontiers such as multimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a series of adversarial stress tests to systematically assess the robustness of flagship models and medical benchmarks. Our study reveals prevalent brittleness in the presence of simple adversarial transformations: leading systems can guess the right answer even with key inputs removed, yet may get confused by the slightest prompt alterations, while fabricating convincing yet flawed reasoning traces. Using clinician-guided rubrics, we demonstrate that popular medical benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure. Our study reveals significant competency gaps of frontier AI in attaining real-world readiness for health applications. If we want AI to earn trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold AI systems accountable to ensure robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

Abstract: A cognitive map is an internal model which encodes the abstract relationships among entities in the world, giving humans and animals the flexibility to adapt to new situations, with a strong out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization that current AI systems still do not possess. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding. MapFormers have broad applications in both neuroscience and AI, by explaining the neural mechanisms giving rise to cognitive maps, while allowing these relation models to be learned at scale.

<title>What Kind of Reasoning (if any) is an LLM actually doing? On the Stochastic Nature and Abductive Appearance of Large Language Models</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, abductive reasoning, stochastic nature, token-completion, evaluation

<br /><br />Summary:  
This article explores how reasoning operates within current Large Language Models (LLMs) that generate text through token-completion. It emphasizes the stochastic, pattern-based foundation of these models rather than actual abductive reasoning processes. Although LLM outputs may resemble abductive reasoning, this appearance stems from their training on human-produced texts containing reasoning patterns, not from genuine understanding or verification. The article demonstrates through examples how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and offer explanatory answers, yet these are not grounded in truth, semantics, or real reasoning capabilities. This dual nature — stochastic generation coupled with seemingly abductive output — has significant implications for how LLMs should be evaluated and applied. While LLMs can be valuable tools for idea generation and supporting human thought, their outputs require critical scrutiny because they cannot reliably identify truth or validate explanations. The article concludes by addressing five common objections to these claims, acknowledging certain limitations in the analysis, and providing an overall evaluation that underscores the importance of cautious interpretation and application of LLM-generated content. <div>

Abstract: This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.

<div> Keywords: small language models, question generation, probabilistic reasoning, learning analytics, generate-then-validate

<br /><br />Summary: This paper investigates the potential of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation, contrasting with the more common use of large language models (LLMs) in learning analytics. The authors propose an innovative pipeline that combines text generation capabilities with probabilistic reasoning to create high-quality questions. The approach uses a "generate-then-validate" strategy, starting with expansive generation to produce numerous candidate questions. It then employs selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning techniques to filter and refine these questions. Two evaluation studies were conducted: one involved seven human experts, and the other made use of a large language model for assessment. Both evaluators concurred that the questions produced were clear, answerable, and largely aligned with the specified learning objectives. The findings indicate that when an SLM is guided by a thoughtfully designed pipeline, it can generate questions of quality comparable to larger models. This work highlights the feasibility and advantages of leveraging smaller models in educational technology tasks, potentially offering more accessible and efficient solutions for automatic question generation in learning analytics. <div>

Abstract: We explore the use of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation as a complement to the prevalent use of their large counterparts in learning analytics research. We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a "generate-then-validate" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.

<div> Keywords: impossible trinity, Statistical Smoothing Trap, DeepNews Framework, hallucination-free rate, financial journalism  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the "impossible trinity" challenge in long-form text generation within vertical domains, namely achieving low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression simultaneously in large language models (LLMs). The authors identify the root cause as the Statistical Smoothing Trap, where existing generative paradigms fail to capture high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes essential to expert writing. To overcome this, they propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that models expert financial journalists' cognitive processes. The framework comprises three core modules: (1) a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism, inspired by information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to reduce hallucinations; (2) schema-guided strategic planning, leveraging domain-specific narrative schemas and Atomic Blocks to create a strong logical structure; and (3) adversarial constraint prompting techniques, including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog, that disrupt probabilistic smoothness in model-generated text to enhance quality. Experiments reveal a critical Knowledge Cliff in financial reporting where content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context is below 15,000 characters, whereas a high-redundancy input over 30,000 characters maintains a Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. A blind test with a leading Chinese tech media outlet showed the DeepNews system, based on DeepSeek-V3-0324, achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, outperforming zero-shot generation by GPT-5, which had 0% acceptance. <div>

Abstract: Central to long-form text generation in vertical domains is the "impossible trinity" confronting current large language models (LLMs): the simultaneous achievement of low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression. This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. In an ecological validity blind test conducted with a top-tier Chinese technology media outlet, the DeepNews system--built on a previous-generation model (DeepSeek-V3-0324)-achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, significantly outperforming the 0% acceptance rate of zero-shot generation by a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model (GPT-5).

<div> Personalization, Review Response, Large Language Models, Prompting, Food Delivery  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of generating personalized review responses in scenarios with limited user information, such as food delivery platforms. The authors propose a novel two-stage prompting framework that infers user personas from short review texts by extracting both explicit attributes like user-stated preferences and implicit cues such as demographic or stylistic information. These inferred persona elements are then integrated into the prompt provided to large language models (LLMs) to generate responses tailored specifically to individual users. To balance creativity and accuracy in responses, the method adjusts decoding temperature during the generation process, encouraging diverse yet relevant outputs. The approach is tested on a real-world dataset gathered from a Korean food delivery app, demonstrating improvements across precision, diversity, and semantic consistency metrics. Notably, this method enhances the personalization and relevance of automated review replies without the need for expensive and time-consuming fine-tuning of the underlying language models, making it a practical solution for real-world applications where user data is scarce. <div>

Abstract: Personalized review response generation presents a significant challenge in domains where user information is limited, such as food delivery platforms. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful text generation capabilities, they often produce generic responses when lacking contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a two-stage prompting framework that infers both explicit (e.g., user-stated preferences) and implicit (e.g., demographic or stylistic cues) personas directly from short review texts. These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference. We evaluate our method using a real-world dataset collected from a Korean food delivery app, and assess its impact on precision, diversity, and semantic consistency. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of persona-augmented prompting in enhancing the relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning.

<div> safety alignment, catastrophic forgetting, continual learning, fine-tuning, large language models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the critical issue of safety alignment degradation in large language models (LLMs) when they are fine-tuned or adapted to new tasks, attributing the problem largely to catastrophic forgetting.<br /><br />2. It frames the preservation of safety during fine-tuning as a continual learning (CL) problem, specifically in the fine-tuning-as-a-service context where users provide data to customize models.<br /><br />3. Several established CL methods including regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging techniques are adapted and evaluated for their effectiveness in mitigating safety degradation.<br /><br />4. Experiments are conducted under two scenarios—using benign user data and poisoned user data—demonstrating that CL approaches consistently reduce attack success rates compared to standard fine-tuning.<br /><br />5. Among these methods, the DER (Dark Experience Replay) approach shows superior performance by effectively preserving safety while maintaining task utility across multiple tasks (GSM8K, SST2, Code) and diverse model families (LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2B). This establishes continual learning as a viable and practical solution for safety-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs. <div>

Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important with their democratization. In this paper, we study the safety degradation that comes with adapting LLMs to new tasks. We attribute this safety compromise to catastrophic forgetting and frame the problem of preserving safety when fine-tuning as a continual learning (CL) problem. We consider the fine-tuning-as-a-service setup where the user uploads their data to a service provider to get a customized model that excels on the user's selected task. We adapt several CL approaches from the literature and systematically evaluate their ability to mitigate safety degradation. These include regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging approaches. We consider two scenarios, (1) benign user data and (2) poisoned user data. Our results demonstrate that CL approaches consistently achieve lower attack success rates than standard fine-tuning. Among these, DER outperforms both other CL methods and existing safety-preserving baselines while maintaining task utility. These findings generalize across three downstream tasks (GSM8K, SST2, Code) and three model families (LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2B), establishing CL as a practical solution to preserve safety.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a critical issue for safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in the medical domain. Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications.

<div> Keywords: Vision–Language Models, multilingual adaptation, dataset translation, LoRA finetuning, two-stage finetuning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of extending English-trained Vision–Language Models (VLMs) to support multiple languages, which is vital for improving accessibility for non-English speakers. The authors examine three approaches: a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a novel two-stage finetuning strategy that decouples vision adaptation from language adaptation. These methods are evaluated using standard multimodal benchmarks translated into target languages, supplemented by assessments from native speakers to ensure evaluation quality. Results indicate that the quality of translated datasets heavily constrains multilingual VLM performance, acting as a significant bottleneck during both training and evaluation phases. Consequently, translation errors and inconsistencies limit model effectiveness and reliability across different languages. The study suggests that prioritizing the creation of native-language datasets, rather than relying predominantly on translated corpora, could considerably enhance multilingual VLM development. Additionally, improvements in translation methodologies are recommended to mitigate current data quality issues. Overall, the findings offer valuable insights into optimizing multilingual VLM adaptation strategies and highlight the critical importance of data quality for enabling more inclusive and accurate multimodal AI systems. <div>
arXiv:2512.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years, particularly in the development of Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that understand both visual and textual data. However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.

<div> Keywords: AI software engineering, Confucius Code Agent, long-context reasoning, persistent memory, modular tool use  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-source AI coding agent designed to handle challenges present in industrial-scale software engineering tasks. CCA is built on the Confucius SDK, a development platform emphasizing three perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK features a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory enabling long-context reasoning, which helps the agent manage extensive codebases effectively. It incorporates a persistent note-taking system that supports continual learning across sessions, enhancing memory durability over time. Additionally, the SDK provides a modular extension module that facilitates robust coordination and usage of complex toolchains during test time. The platform includes a meta-agent that automates the build-test-improve cycle, synthesizing, evaluating, and refining agent configurations to quickly adapt to new tasks, environments, and tools. The instantiation of CCA on this SDK achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world tasks, reaching a Resolve@1 score of 54.3% on the SWE-Bench-Pro benchmark, significantly outperforming previous coding agents. Overall, CCA and the Confucius SDK offer a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation that bridges the gap between research prototypes and production-grade AI software engineering agents suitable for industrial applications. <div>
arXiv:2512.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.

<div> Sliding Window Attention, Transformer, Large Language Models, Adaptation, Fine-tuning  

<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses the inefficiency of the self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which scales quadratically with input length and hampers long-context inference. To tackle this, Sliding Window Attention (SWA) is introduced, reducing complexity to linear. However, directly applying SWA during inference in models pretrained with full attention (FA) results in significant performance drops due to the mismatch between training and inference. The authors propose Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a combination of five methods designed to adapt FA-pretrained LLMs to SWA without requiring pretraining. These methods include (1) using SWA only during the prefilling stage, (2) preserving "sink" tokens, (3) interleaving layers of FA and SWA, (4) leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques, and (5) fine-tuning the model. Experimental results show that no individual method fully recovers long-context performance, but specific synergistic combinations succeed in doing so. Additionally, the authors explore the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide practical recommendations for varying application scenarios. The proposed approach advances the use of SWA in pretrained models for efficient long-context inference without retraining. The codebase supporting this work is made publicly available. <div>

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

<div> Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Cooperative Retrieval, Multi-Hop Question Answering, Document Reranking, Reasoning Chain Reconstruction<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper introduces CoopRAG, a new retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework aimed at improving accuracy in both simple and multi-hop question answering (QA) tasks. Existing RAG methods struggle with incorrect document retrievals and hallucinations, which CoopRAG addresses through cooperative interaction between a retriever and a large language model (LLM). The framework works by first unrolling a question into sub-questions and a partial reasoning chain with masked uncertain parts. It then retrieves documents enhanced with these sub-questions and the reasoning chain context. Documents are reranked by leveraging cooperation between earlier and later layers of the retriever model to ensure more precise relevance ranking. The LLM then reconstructs the reasoning chain by filling in the masked positions. Experiments on multiple multi-hop QA datasets and one simple QA dataset show that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods in both retrieval accuracy and overall QA performance. This cooperative strategy improves the synergy between retrieval and generation components for more reliable and factual question answering. Additionally, the authors provide the code for the community to further explore and build upon their approach. <div>
arXiv:2512.10422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since large language models (LLMs) have a tendency to generate factually inaccurate output, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained significant attention as a key means to mitigate this downside of harnessing only LLMs. However, existing RAG methods for simple and multi-hop question answering (QA) are still prone to incorrect retrievals and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances. Our code is available.\footnote{https://github.com/meaningful96/CoopRAG}

This model incorporates a Cyrillic-dense tokenizer tailored to the unique characteristics of the Russian script, enhancing its language processing efficiency. A key innovation is the adaptation of the EAGLE speculative-decoding pipeline, which significantly reduces latency during inference, making the model faster and more practical for real-world applications. To promote transparent, reproducible, and extensible research, the authors are releasing the model weights alongside several important resources: the T-Wix 500k instruction corpus to facilitate fine-tuning and training, the T-Math benchmark for evaluating reasoning performance, and the EAGLE model weights for inference optimization. These resources collectively support the research community and developers in studying Russian-language reasoning and adapting the model or inference pipeline as needed. Additionally, a public web demo is provided that demonstrates both reasoning and non-reasoning operational modes, showcasing the performance improvements from the inference stack across various domains. Overall, T-pro 2.0 is positioned as an accessible, open system aimed at supporting efficient and practical Russian LLM applications.<br /><br /> <div>

<title>Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism: A Context-Aware Framework for Detecting and Restoring "Tortured Phrases" in Scientific Literature</title>

<div> Keywords: adversarial plagiarism, tortured phrases, semantic reconstruction, SciBERT, dense vector retrieval<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper addresses the threat to scientific literature integrity posed by adversarial text generation techniques, especially automated paraphrasing tools that create "tortured phrases" — unusual synonyms that obscure plagiarism.  
2. Existing plagiarism detection methods largely rely on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which often fail to detect novel obfuscations and cannot trace the original plagiarized sources.  
3. The authors propose a novel framework called Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), which both detects anomalies and attempts to mathematically recover the original terminology.  
4. SRAP employs a two-stage approach: (1) anomaly detection using token-level pseudo-perplexity with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT), and (2) semantic reconstruction leveraging dense vector retrieval (FAISS) combined with sentence-level alignment (SBERT) for source-based restoration.  
5. Experimental results on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text demonstrate SRAP's superiority, with 23.67% restoration accuracy, far outperforming zero-shot baseline methods that achieve 0.00%. The method also highlights the importance of static decision boundaries for robust detection in jargon-heavy texts and enables forensic linkages to probable source documents. <div>

Abstract: The integrity and reliability of scientific literature is facing a serious threat by adversarial text generation techniques, specifically from the use of automated paraphrasing tools to mask plagiarism. These tools generate "tortured phrases", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. "counterfeit consciousness" for "artificial intelligence"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Knowledge Graphs, KG-BERT, Factual Reliability, Knowledge-Intensive Tasks  

<br /><br />Summary: Large language models (LLMs) such as Claude, Mistral IA, and GPT-4 have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language processing (NLP). However, these models often suffer from a lack of structured knowledge, resulting in factual inconsistencies in their outputs. To address this limitation, the authors propose integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into LLMs using a method called KG-BERT. This integration aims to enhance both the grounding of information and the reasoning ability of LLMs. Empirical experiments conducted by the researchers indicate significant improvements in tasks that require deep knowledge, including question answering and entity linking. By combining structured knowledge from KGs with the contextual understanding of LLMs, the approach improves factual reliability, reducing the frequency of errors caused by hallucinated or incorrect information. Furthermore, this method facilitates the development of more context-aware next-generation LLMs that can better understand and utilize external knowledge sources. Overall, the research demonstrates that coupling LLMs with Knowledge Graphs via KG-BERT is a promising direction for advancing the factual accuracy and reasoning efficiency of AI language systems, paving the way for enhanced language models better suited for complex knowledge-driven applications. <div>

<div> Keywords: conversational agent, Large Language Models, multimodal data, affective states, educational interventions<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces a psychologically-aware conversational agent aimed at enhancing both learning outcomes and emotional well-being within educational environments. The system integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), a knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with attention mechanisms to classify students’ cognitive and affective states in real time. Unlike earlier chatbots that focus solely on tutoring or emotional support, this approach utilizes multimodal data including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends to assess engagement, stress levels, and conceptual understanding. A pilot study conducted with university students demonstrated that the agent improved motivation, reduced stress, and produced moderate academic performance gains when compared to baseline methods. These findings highlight the benefits of combining semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling to create adaptive, student-centered educational interventions that respond dynamically to learners’ needs. The work underscores the potential of such integrated systems to provide more personalized and effective learning experiences through real-time psychological awareness and support. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a psychologically-aware conversational agent designed to enhance both learning performance and emotional well-being in educational settings. The system combines Large Language Models (LLMs), a knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with attention to classify students' cognitive and affective states in real time. Unlike prior chatbots limited to either tutoring or affective support, our approach leverages multimodal data-including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends-to infer engagement, stress, and conceptual understanding. A pilot study with university students demonstrated improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods. These results underline the promise of integrating semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling to support adaptive, student-centered educational interventions.

<title>Grammaticality Judgments in Humans and Language Models: Revisiting Generative Grammar with LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10453</link>

<div> Keywords: syntactic structure, large language models, subject-auxiliary inversion, parasitic gaps, grammaticality contrasts<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. This paper investigates what can be considered evidence for syntactic structure by examining whether large language models (LLMs) trained only on surface-level text data reflect underlying grammatical structures.  
2. The study focuses on two classic syntactic phenomena: subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps, which in traditional generative grammar indicate hierarchical internal structure.  
3. Using prompts to elicit acceptability ratings, the authors test models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 to see if these models distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical sentence variants, thus reflecting knowledge of syntax beyond linear word order.  
4. Results show that the LLMs consistently differentiate between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in both constructions, suggesting the models are sensitive to hierarchical structural representations.  
5. The findings imply that functional sensitivity to syntax can emerge from predictive training on surface forms alone, without explicit syntactic encoding, showing that structural generalizations can develop independently of human-like cognitive knowledge. <div>

Abstract: What counts as evidence for syntactic structure? In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar. In this paper, we test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms, reproduce these contrasts in ways that imply an underlying structural representation.
  We focus on two classic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing recognition of the subject boundary) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). We evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts eliciting acceptability ratings. Results show that LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, and as such support that they are sensitive to structure and not just linear order. Structural generalizations, distinct from cognitive knowledge, emerge from predictive training on surface forms, suggesting functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding.

<div> Keywords: large language models, multilingual training, data reweighting, Iberian languages, continual pre-training  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge faced by large language models (LLMs) that are predominantly trained on high-resource languages, resulting in suboptimal performance for mid- and low-resource languages. To tackle this issue, the authors propose a two-step approach: (i) optimizing the language distribution by training a small proxy model using a domain reweighting method called DoGE, which they extend to a multilingual setup as XDoGE, and (ii) rescaling the data based on established language weights to train a full-size model either from scratch or through continual pre-training (CPT). They focus on six languages with varying resource availability and linguistic relationships: English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), and Galician and Basque (low-resource). Experiments are conducted with Salamandra-2b, a suitable model for these languages, to examine the effects of data repetition for minor languages and under-sampling for dominant languages, using the IberoBench evaluation framework. The study culminates in releasing the IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model, which centers on Iberian languages alongside English, pretrained from scratch and further refined via CPT with XDoGE-based weights, showing promising improvements in performance across these languages. <div>

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive amounts of text data, primarily from a few dominant languages. Studies suggest that this over-reliance on high-resource languages, such as English, hampers LLM performance in mid- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to (i) optimize the language distribution by training a small proxy model within a domain-reweighing DoGE algorithm that we extend to XDoGE for a multilingual setup, and (ii) rescale the data and train a full-size model with the established language weights either from scratch or within a continual pre-training phase (CPT). We target six languages possessing a variety of geographic and intra- and inter-language-family relations, namely, English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), Galician and Basque (low-resource). We experiment with Salamandra-2b, which is a promising model for these languages. We investigate the effects of substantial data repetition on minor languages and under-sampling on dominant languages using the IberoBench framework for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we release a new promising IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model centering on Iberian languages and English that we pretrained from scratch and further improved using CPT with the XDoGE weights.

<title>Causal Reasoning Favors Encoders: On The Limits of Decoder-Only Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10561</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10561</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: in-context learning, causal reasoning, encoder architectures, decoder models, fine-tuning<br /><br />Summary:  
1. In-context learning (ICL) has driven significant progress in large language models (LLMs), but its effectiveness in causal reasoning tasks is not well understood.  
2. Causal reasoning requires multihop compositions and strict conjunctive control, which can be hindered if models rely on spurious lexical correlations instead of genuine causal relations.  
3. The authors hypothesize that encoder and encoder-decoder architectures, because they project inputs into a latent space, are better suited to multihop conjunctive causal reasoning than decoder-only architectures.  
4. Experiments comparing fine-tuned models and zero/few-shot ICL across both natural language and non-natural language tasks reveal that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often focusing on irrelevant input features.  
5. Decoder-only models show notable brittleness under distributional shifts, while fine-tuned encoder and encoder-decoder models generalize more robustly across diverse test conditions, including non-natural language scenarios.  
6. Large-scale decoder-only models can match or outperform encoder-based models, but for cost-effective and short-term robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder-decoder architectures with targeted fine-tuning are recommended. <div>
arXiv:2512.10561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In context learning (ICL) underpins recent advances in large language models (LLMs), although its role and performance in causal reasoning remains unclear. Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable.

<div> Keywords: Reward Modeling, Role-playing Dialogue, Continuous Implicit Preferences, Narrative Coherence, Human Alignment  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenges of reward modeling for large language models (LLMs) in subjective, open-ended domains like role-playing dialogue, where existing models poorly capture nuanced, persona-based human judgments. The authors introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark targeting reward modeling across seven specific capabilities including narrative management, role consistency, and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench shows significant performance gaps between current general-purpose reward models and human judgments, especially in narrative and stylistic aspects. To overcome these issues, they propose RoleRM, a new reward model trained using Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which treats subjective evaluation as continuous, consistent pairwise supervision structured via multiple strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoleRM outperforms strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, notably improving narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity. The study highlights the critical importance of representing preferences continuously and ensuring annotation consistency for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems. This work lays foundational ground for more accurate and aligned evaluation frameworks in role-play and other complex interactive language tasks. <div>

Abstract: Reward modeling has become a cornerstone of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet, when extended to subjective and open-ended domains such as role play, existing reward models exhibit severe degradation, struggling to capture nuanced and persona-grounded human judgments. To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous preference representation and annotation consistency, establishing a foundation for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.

<div> Keywords: AgriGPT-Omni, multilingual speech data, multimodal large language models, agricultural omni-framework, AgriBench-Omni-2K<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces AgriGPT-Omni, a novel agricultural omni-framework designed to integrate speech, vision, and text within a unified multimodal architecture. To overcome challenges in agricultural AI, the authors developed a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline, yielding the largest agricultural speech dataset to date with 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples spanning six languages. Building on this data, they train the first agricultural omni-model through a three-stage process: injecting textual knowledge, progressively aligning multiple modalities, and applying GRPO-based reinforcement learning. This enables comprehensive multilingual and multimodal reasoning capabilities. The study also presents AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark tailored for agriculture, encompassing diverse tasks that involve speech, vision, and text, alongside multilingual evaluation slices, standardized protocols, and reproducible tools. Experimental results demonstrate that AgriGPT-Omni markedly outperforms general-purpose baseline models in both multilingual and multimodal reasoning, as well as real-world speech understanding scenarios. By releasing all models, datasets, benchmarks, and code, the work aims to foster reproducible research, promote inclusive agricultural intelligence, and support sustainable AI development, particularly benefiting low-resource regions worldwide. <div>

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the lack of multilingual speech data, unified multimodal architectures, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions.

<title>From Data Scarcity to Data Care: Reimagining Language Technologies for Serbian and other Low-Resource Languages</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Serbian language, low resource languages, language technology, Data Care framework, cultural bias<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article investigates the challenges faced in developing language technologies for low resource languages, using Serbian as a case study. It highlights how large language models (LLMs), often trained predominantly on English data, embed cultural and linguistic biases that overlook the unique attributes of less dominant languages. The study traces these problems to structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors, notably the historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage and current engineering-focused approaches that emphasize functionality over linguistic nuance. Key technical issues include superficial transliteration methods, over-reliance on English-trained models, data biases, and datasets lacking cultural specificity. To confront these challenges, the authors propose a novel framework called Data Care, based on CARE principles: Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics. This framework shifts bias mitigation from a reactive technical fix to a proactive, foundational element of corpus design, annotation, and governance. It aims to create more inclusive, culturally grounded, and sustainable language technologies, addressing power imbalances and cultural blind spots perpetuated by conventional LLM development. The study draws on semi-structured interviews with experts in linguistics, digital humanities, and AI development, establishing Data Care as a replicable model for other low resource language contexts. <div>

Abstract: Large language models are commonly trained on dominant languages like English, and their representation of low resource languages typically reflects cultural and linguistic biases present in the source language materials. Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots.

<title>Textual Data Bias Detection and Mitigation - An Extensible Pipeline with Experimental Evaluation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: large language models, data bias, representation bias, stereotype mitigation, counterfactual data augmentation<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses bias in textual data used to train large language models (LLMs), focusing on representation bias and explicit stereotypes linked to configurable sensitive attributes such as gender, religion, and age. It introduces a comprehensive pipeline with four components: (1) LLM-generated word lists to detect relevant group labels, ensuring quality-based identification of groups; (2) quantification of representation bias using the Demographic Representation Score; (3) detection and mitigation of stereotypes via sociolinguistically informed filtering techniques; and (4) compensation of representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation to improve data balance. The pipeline's effectiveness is evaluated in two main ways: first, through human validation and baseline comparisons demonstrating successful reduction of biases and stereotypes in the dataset; second, by fine-tuning multiple LLMs (ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters) on the debiased data and assessing bias using established benchmarks. Results reveal that while data debiasing reduces biases in the dataset, it does not consistently translate to improved bias metrics in fine-tuned models, highlighting limitations in current bias evaluation methods and the need for more targeted data manipulations to effectively mitigate model biases in practice. <div>

Abstract: Textual data used to train large language models (LLMs) exhibits multifaceted bias manifestations encompassing harmful language and skewed demographic distributions. Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Verification, Chain of Thought, Active Learning, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the limitations of current verifiers in evaluating large language models' reasoning processes, specifically outcome-based verifiers (OVs) and process-based verifiers (PVs). OVs struggle to assess unreliable intermediate reasoning steps within long chains of thought (CoTs), while PVs face challenges due to the scarcity and high cost of quality human annotations required for training. To overcome these issues, the authors propose the Outcome-based Process Verifier (OPV), a novel verification approach that verifies the rationale by summarizing outcomes from long CoTs, balancing accuracy and efficiency and enabling large-scale annotation. OPV is improved iteratively using an active learning framework that focuses expert annotations on the most uncertain cases and employs Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for continual enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate OPV’s superior performance, achieving a new state-of-the-art F1 score of 83.1 on a held-out benchmark, surpassing larger open-source models like Qwen3-Max-Preview. OPV also effectively identifies false positives in synthetic datasets with expert-level consistency. When integrated with policy models, OPV significantly boosts task accuracy, exemplified by an increase from 55.2% to 73.3% accuracy on AIME2025 using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B under expanding compute budgets. <div>
arXiv:2512.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in solving complex reasoning tasks by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \textbf{O}utcome-based \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out \textsc{\thisbench}, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, OPV consistently yields performance gains, e.g., raising the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2\% to 73.3\% on AIME2025 as the compute budget scales.

<div> Caribbean English, emergency speech recognition, triage protocols, vocal distress detection, large language models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of degraded performance in emergency speech recognition systems on non-standard English varieties, specifically Caribbean English, which leads to gaps in emergency services for Caribbean populations.<br /><br />2. To overcome this, the authors introduce TRIDENT, a three-layer dispatcher-support system that structures emergency call inputs for human triage, using protocols like ESI for routine and START for mass casualty incidents, ensuring operation even when automatic speech recognition (ASR) fails.<br /><br />3. TRIDENT integrates Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local clinical entity extraction powered by large language models, and bio-acoustic vocal distress detection, providing dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical information, and vocal stress markers.<br /><br />4. The system treats low ASR confidence not as failure but as a prioritization signal, especially when aligned with high vocal distress indicators, reflecting stress-induced speech changes common during crises.<br /><br />5. Additionally, entity extraction captures critical clinical details from speech with low vocal stress, as composed callers may report emergencies without paralinguistic distress.<br /><br />6. The authors ground their design in psycholinguistic theory around stress and code-switching, aiming for offline functionality during disasters.<br /><br />7. While the framework establishes a foundation for accent-resilient emergency AI, empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls is planned as future work. <div>

Abstract: Emergency speech recognition systems exhibit systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating a critical gap in services for Caribbean populations. We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.
  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.
  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that ensures Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.

<div> Keywords: multilingual models, language adaptation, model scaling, catastrophic forgetting, model merging<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This work addresses the challenge of developing high-performing language models for medium- and lower-resource languages, where massively multilingual models often underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, particularly at smaller model sizes. The study investigates model scaling as a strategy to adapt pretrained English base models efficiently to new target languages by conducting scaling ablations with models matched by FLOPs. The findings show that larger upscaled models, given sufficient target-language data, can match or outperform smaller models that underwent extensive continual pretraining, highlighting scaling’s benefit for data efficiency. Additionally, scaling helps maintain the original base model’s English capabilities, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The research also examines merging these scaled, language-specific models to build modular and flexible multilingual systems. Although joint multilingual training still outperforms merging, larger upscaled merges exhibit better performance than smaller merges. Significant performance variability across different merging methods points to opportunities for improvement by developing approaches specialized for language-level integration in model merging. <div>

Abstract: Achieving high-performing language models which include medium- and lower-resource languages remains a challenge. Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration.

<title>Script Gap: Evaluating LLM Triage on Indian Languages in Native vs Roman Scripts in a Real World Setting</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, romanization, Indian languages, maternal health triage, orthographic noise  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The study examines the impact of romanization—writing Indian languages in Latin script—on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) used in maternal and newborn healthcare triage in India.  
2. Researchers benchmarked leading LLMs using a real-world dataset of user queries in five Indian languages and Nepali, comparing native script inputs with their romanized counterparts.  
3. The results show a consistent decline in LLM performance for romanized text, with F1 scores dropping by 5 to 12 points compared to native scripts.  
4. This degradation could translate into nearly 2 million additional triage errors annually at their partner maternal health organization, highlighting a major real-world risk.  
5. Importantly, the performance gap is not due to LLMs’ failure to understand the clinical content; models often interpret the semantic intent of romanized queries correctly.  
6. However, despite correct semantic understanding, LLMs’ final classification outputs are brittle and error-prone when faced with the orthographic noise inherent in romanized inputs.  
7. The findings reveal a critical safety blind spot in deploying LLM-based health systems: models may appear to comprehend romanized text yet still fail to process it reliably, posing safety challenges in high-stakes clinical environments. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical applications in India. In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.

<div> FACTS Leaderboard, factuality evaluation, language models, benchmarks, automated judge models

<br /><br />Summary:  
The FACTS Leaderboard is an online evaluation suite designed to comprehensively measure the factual accuracy of language models across a variety of scenarios. It consists of four distinct sub-leaderboards: (1) FACTS Multimodal, which tests factual responses to image-based questions, bridging visual and textual understanding. (2) FACTS Parametric, which assesses models’ world knowledge by querying them with closed-book factoid questions relying solely on their internal parameters. (3) FACTS Search, which evaluates the ability of models to provide factually accurate answers in information-seeking scenarios using a search API. (4) FACTS Grounding (v2), focusing on the factual grounding of long-form responses based on provided documents and featuring improved judge models for better evaluation. Each sub-leaderboard uses automated judge models to score responses, and the overall suite score averages performance across all four to provide a balanced and robust measure of factuality. The leaderboard suite includes both public and private data splits to maintain integrity while allowing external participation. The FACTS Leaderboard will be actively maintained to support ongoing evaluation and development of factual accuracy in language models. The benchmark is accessible at https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/google/facts. <div>

Abstract: We introduce The FACTS Leaderboard, an online leaderboard suite and associated set of benchmarks that comprehensively evaluates the ability of language models to generate factually accurate text across diverse scenarios. The suite provides a holistic measure of factuality by aggregating the performance of models on four distinct sub-leaderboards: (1) FACTS Multimodal, which measures the factuality of responses to image-based questions; (2) FACTS Parametric, which assesses models' world knowledge by answering closed-book factoid questions from internal parameters; (3) FACTS Search, which evaluates factuality in information-seeking scenarios, where the model must use a search API; and (4) FACTS Grounding (v2), which evaluates whether long-form responses are grounded in provided documents, featuring significantly improved judge models. Each sub-leaderboard employs automated judge models to score model responses, and the final suite score is an average of the four components, designed to provide a robust and balanced assessment of a model's overall factuality. The FACTS Leaderboard Suite will be actively maintained, containing both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding its integrity.

Abstract: LabelFusion is a fusion ensemble for text classification that learns to combine a traditional transformer-based classifier (e.g., RoBERTa) with one or more Large Language Models (LLMs such as OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or DeepSeek) to deliver accurate and cost-aware predictions across multi-class and multi-label tasks. The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users. Under the hood, LabelFusion integrates vector signals from both sources by concatenating the ML backbone's embeddings with the LLM-derived per-class scores -- obtained through structured prompt-engineering strategies -- and feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) that produces the final prediction. This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: The Hobbit, emotional tone, computational text analysis, NRC-VAD lexicon, emotional trajectory<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study investigates the emotional tone of dialogue in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937) using computational text analysis methods. First, the dialogue was extracted from the text employing regular expressions to isolate speech segments. Then, these segments were preprocessed and scored using the NRC-VAD lexicon, which quantifies three emotional dimensions: valence (positivity), arousal (intensity), and dominance (agency). The analysis reveals that the dialogue generally maintains a positive emotional tone reflected by high valence scores and a calm atmosphere indicated by low arousal levels. Notably, there is a gradual increase in the sense of agency or dominance as the story unfolds, suggesting growing character empowerment or control. These emotional patterns mirror the novel’s pacing and rhythm, where moments of danger and excitement alternate with humor, camaraderie, and relief, balancing tension with comfort throughout the narrative. The study also employs visual tools such as emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds to illustrate how Tolkien's language cycles between states of tension and ease. By integrating digital computational tools with literary analysis, this research highlights how subtle emotional structures in literature can be uncovered, providing insights into the storytelling techniques and emotional modulation that contribute to the lasting appeal of The Hobbit. <div>

<div> Emotions, political communication, multimodal AI, emotional arousal, bias<br /><br />Summary: This paper explores the application of multimodal large language models (mLLMs) for analyzing emotional arousal in political communication through video data. First, it highlights the centrality of emotions in politics and the rise of audio-visual materials used for emotion analysis. Second, the study evaluates the effectiveness of current multimodal generative AI models in rating emotional arousal across two human-labeled video data sets. Third, findings indicate that under controlled or ideal conditions, mLLMs produce highly reliable arousal ratings with minimal demographic bias, demonstrating their potential. Fourth, however, when applied to real-world scenarios such as parliamentary debates, the models fail to maintain this accuracy, posing risks for downstream statistical analyses. Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of ongoing, rigorous evaluation of emerging generative AI tools for political analysis and introduces a replicable framework to assist future research in this area. <div>

Abstract: Emotions are central to politics and analyzing their role in political communication has a long tradition. As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework.

<div> Keywords: Urban regeneration, Large language models, Cyclical Urban Planning, Multi-agent system, Adaptive planning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Urban regeneration is a complex process that must adapt to the evolving needs associated with rapid urbanization. To address this, the paper introduces Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP), a novel framework leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs) to create a continuous, adaptive urban planning process. The CUP framework is composed of three main components: (1) Planning, where LLM agents generate and iteratively refine urban plans by analyzing contextual data relevant to the city environment; (2) Living, which simulates the behaviors and interactions of residents within the urban space to model real-life dynamics; and (3) Judging, a mechanism that evaluates the effectiveness of generated plans and provides actionable feedback to improve subsequent iterations. This closed-loop process fosters dynamic responsiveness, allowing urban plans to evolve according to simulated real-world interactions and assessments. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the CUP framework effectively sustains continuous and adaptive urban planning cycles, potentially enhancing urban regeneration efforts by integrating AI-driven simulations and evaluations in an ongoing, iterative manner. Overall, this study highlights the potential of multi-agent LLM systems in addressing the challenges of modern urbanization through automated, cyclical planning methodologies. <div>

Abstract: Urban regeneration presents significant challenges within the context of urbanization, requiring adaptive approaches to tackle evolving needs. Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we propose Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP), a new paradigm that continuously generates, evaluates, and refines urban plans in a closed-loop. Specifically, our multi-agent LLM-based framework consists of three key components: (1) Planning, where LLM agents generate and refine urban plans based on contextual data; (2) Living, where agents simulate the behaviors and interactions of residents, modeling life in the urban environment; and (3) Judging, which involves evaluating plan effectiveness and providing iterative feedback for improvement. The cyclical process enables a dynamic and responsive planning approach. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as a continuous and adaptive planning process.

Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, scientific information extraction, multi-modal content, modular framework, data aggregation

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper introduces SciEx, a modular and composable framework designed to improve scientific information extraction using large language models (LLMs). It addresses key challenges faced by prior systems, including handling long-context documents typical in scientific literature and integrating multi-modal content such as text and figures. SciEx also tackles the difficulty of consolidating varied, fine-grained information from multiple publications into standardized output formats. A unique feature of SciEx is its decoupling of core components like PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation, enabling greater flexibility and adaptability. This modularity allows for the seamless integration of new models, prompt designs, and reasoning methods without extensive system re-engineering or fine-tuning, particularly valuable in scenarios where the target data schema changes rapidly. The framework is empirically evaluated on datasets spanning three scientific domains, demonstrating its ability to accurately and consistently extract detailed scientific information. The study offers a balanced view of current LLM capabilities, highlighting both their potential and ongoing limitations in this application area. Overall, SciEx contributes a practical approach toward scalable and extensible scientific data extraction pipelines using LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly touted as powerful tools for automating scientific information extraction. However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently. Our findings provide practical insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based pipelines.

<div> Diffusion models, autoregressive generation, image captioning, COCO dataset, suggestion module<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Diffusion denoising models have achieved impressive performance in generative computer vision tasks but still do not surpass standard autoregressive models in discrete domains. 2. This work proposes a novel paradigm that uses diffusion models to provide suggestions to autoregressive generation rather than replacing it, combining the strengths of both approaches. 3. The proposed model, Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), exploits the bidirectional and refining capabilities of diffusion models alongside the strong linguistic structure of autoregressive methods. 4. SST attains state-of-the-art results on the COCO image captioning dataset, achieving a CIDEr-D score of 125.1 without reinforcement learning, outperforming previous diffusion and autoregressive methods by 1.5 and 2.5 points respectively. 5. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the suggestion module, showing a positive correlation between the quality of suggestions and caption performance, marking a promising and underexplored research direction. Code implementation is publicly available for further research and replication. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion Denoising models demonstrated impressive results across generative Computer Vision tasks, but they still fail to outperform standard autoregressive solutions in the discrete domain, and only match them at best. In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points. On top of the strong results, we performed extensive experiments to validate the proposal and analyze the impact of the suggestion module. Results demonstrate a positive correlation between suggestion and caption quality, overall indicating a currently underexplored but promising research direction.

<div> parallel decoding, autoregressive models, speculative consensus, frozen pre-trained model, coordination primitives  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the latency bottleneck in autoregressive decoding of Large Language Models (LLMs), which traditionally occurs due to its inherently sequential nature that scales linearly with output length. It critiques existing "Decomposition-and-Fill" methods like Skeleton-of-Thought, highlighting their drawback of coherence drift caused by lack of cross-stream communication. To overcome these issues, the authors propose the Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT), a parameter-efficient architecture designed to embed coordination mechanisms directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model without retraining the base model. PDT incorporates lightweight Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC) adapters that enable parallel decoding streams to synchronize through a shared, dynamic latent space. Coordination among streams is formulated as a speculative consensus problem, with sibling streams broadcasting semantic "notes" to a global bus verified by a learned verification head. The approach is validated on a long 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20-billion-parameter backbone model. Experimental results demonstrate that PDT facilitates effective self-correction, achieving 77.8% precision in coverage prediction and approximating serial semantics closely, all without modifying the original model’s weights. The study establishes PDT as a scalable and efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, instruction following, automated auditing, Offscript, information seeking<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the growing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative search systems by diverse users who have different preferences for how knowledge is sourced and presented. 2. Users often customize LLM behavior using custom instructions and behavioral prompts, but there is currently no effective mechanism to audit whether these instructions are being followed accurately. 3. The authors introduce Offscript, an automated auditing tool designed to efficiently detect potential failures in LLMs’ compliance with custom instructions. 4. A pilot study was conducted using custom instructions collected from Reddit conversations, where Offscript identified possible instruction-following deviations in 86.4% of cases. 5. Upon human review, 22.2% of these flagged deviations were confirmed as significant violations, demonstrating Offscript’s practical utility in evaluating behavioral compliance. The study suggests that automated auditing tools like Offscript can play a critical role in ensuring LLMs adhere to user instructions, thereby improving reliability and trustworthiness in information seeking applications. <div>

While users can customize LLM behavior through custom instructions and behavioral prompts, no mechanism exists to evaluate whether these instructions are being followed effectively. We present Offscript, an automated auditing tool that efficiently identifies potential instruction following failures in LLMs. In a pilot study analyzing custom instructions sourced from Reddit, Offscript detected potential deviations from instructed behavior in 86.4% of conversations, 22.2% of which were confirmed as material violations through human review. Our findings suggest that automated auditing serves as a viable approach for evaluating compliance to behavioral instructions related to information seeking.

It introduces CIEGAD, a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework designed for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles using cluster conditioning to better understand data structure and applies a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation method combining class frequency and geometric indicators to guide data generation. The framework uniquely integrates both interpolative and extrapolative synthesis, allowing fine control over the generation direction to cover both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data regions. Quality control is enforced via geometry-constrained filtering and an innovative LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism which evaluates the generated samples. Extensive experiments across multiple classification tasks, particularly long-tailed and multi-class classification, demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the data distribution perimeter without sacrificing alignment or semantic diversity. Performance improvements in F1 score and recall metrics confirm the approach’s success in harmonizing distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. Overall, CIEGAD offers a practical, comprehensive solution for augmenting underrepresented regions in data while maintaining relevance to real-world distributions. <div>

Abstract: In practical deep learning deployment, the scarcity of data and the imbalance of label distributions often lead to semantically uncovered regions within the real-world data distribution, hindering model training and causing misclassification near class boundaries as well as unstable behaviors in peripheral areas. Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data.

<div> Keywords: watermarking, language models, probabilistic automata, undetectability, robustness  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces a novel class of watermarking schemes for language models based on probabilistic automata, addressing the limitations of prior methods. First, it critiques a recent watermarking approach that, while distortion-free and resilient to edit-distance attacks, suffers from limited diversity in text generation and incurs high computational detection costs. Second, it emphasizes the importance of undetectability, which prevents adversaries from easily spotting or mimicking watermarks. Third, the authors propose two new instantiations of their probabilistic automata-based scheme: (i) a practical version that significantly increases generation diversity exponentially and improves computational efficiency, and (ii) a theoretical version offering formal guarantees of undetectability grounded in cryptographic assumptions. Fourth, extensive empirical evaluations are conducted using state-of-the-art language models, LLaMA-3B and Mistral-7B. Finally, results demonstrate that the new scheme excels in robustness against attacks and operational efficiency, confirming its suitability for real-world applications where secure and undetectable watermarking of generated text is critical. <div>

Abstract: A recent watermarking scheme for language models achieves distortion-free embedding and robustness to edit-distance attacks. However, it suffers from limited generation diversity and high detection overhead. In parallel, recent research has focused on undetectability, a property ensuring that watermarks remain difficult for adversaries to detect and spoof. In this work, we introduce a new class of watermarking schemes constructed through probabilistic automata. We present two instantiations: (i) a practical scheme with exponential generation diversity and computational efficiency, and (ii) a theoretical construction with formal undetectability guarantees under cryptographic assumptions. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-3B and Mistral-7B validate the superior performance of our scheme in terms of robustness and efficiency.

The paper introduces MotionEdit, a novel dataset specifically designed for motion-centric image editing, which aims to modify subject actions and interactions in images while preserving identity, structure, and physical plausibility.<br /><br />2. Unlike existing datasets that focus mostly on static appearance changes or contain low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs with realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos, addressing a scientifically and practically challenging task.<br /><br />3. To assess model performance on this new task, the authors present MotionEdit-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that tests models on motion-centric edits using generative, discriminative, and preference-based evaluation metrics.<br /><br />4. Benchmark results indicate that current state-of-the-art diffusion-based image editing models struggle significantly with motion editing.<br /><br />5. To overcome this limitation, the paper proposes MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that leverages motion alignment rewards based on motion flow consistency between inputs and edited outputs to guide the model towards producing accurate motion transformations.<br /><br />6. Extensive experiments conducted on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate that MotionNFT consistently improves both editing quality and motion fidelity across different base models without compromising their general editing capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach. <div>

Abstract: We introduce MotionEdit, a novel dataset for motion-centric image editing-the task of modifying subject actions and interactions while preserving identity, structure, and physical plausibility. Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.
  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit show that MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity of both base models on the motion editing task without sacrificing general editing ability, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<div> Keywords: Automatic audio captioning, reference-free evaluation, CLAPScore, BRACE benchmark, Large Audio Language Models (LALMs)  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating automatic audio captioning quality in scenarios where reference captions are unavailable. It identifies that the most widely used metric, CLAPScore, lacks systematic validation for robustness across diverse conditions. To overcome this, the authors introduce BRACE, a novel benchmark aimed at assessing audio caption evaluation metrics (ACEMs) in a reference-free setting, while also extending its use to evaluate modality alignment in Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). BRACE consists of two sub-benchmarks: BRACE-Main, which focuses on fine-grained caption comparison, and BRACE-Hallucination, which targets the detection of subtle hallucinated content in captions. The datasets are carefully constructed using methods such as high-quality filtering, large language model-based corruption, and human annotation to ensure reliability. The study evaluates the performance of various CLAP model variants and multiple LALMs on the BRACE benchmark. The results reveal that even the best CLAP-based ACEM attains only 70.01 F1-score on BRACE-Main, and the best LALM reaches a lower 63.19, highlighting significant room for improvement. Overall, the BRACE benchmark exposes limitations of current CLAP models and LALMs, providing valuable insights to guide future research in audio caption evaluation and alignment. <div>
arXiv:2512.10403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic audio captioning is essential for audio understanding, enabling applications such as accessibility and content indexing. However, evaluating the quality of audio captions remains a major challenge, especially in reference-free settings where high-quality ground-truth captions are unavailable. While CLAPScore is currently the most widely used reference-free Audio Caption Evaluation Metric(ACEM), its robustness under diverse conditions has not been systematically validated.
  To address this gap, we introduce BRACE, a new benchmark designed to evaluate audio caption alignment quality in a reference-free setting. BRACE is primarily designed for assessing ACEMs, and can also be extended to measure the modality alignment abilities of Large Audio Language Model(LALM). BRACE consists of two sub-benchmarks: BRACE-Main for fine-grained caption comparison and BRACE-Hallucination for detecting subtle hallucinated content. We construct these datasets through high-quality filtering, LLM-based corruption, and human annotation.
  Given the widespread adoption of CLAPScore as a reference-free ACEM and the increasing application of LALMs in audio-language tasks, we evaluate both approaches using the BRACE benchmark, testing CLAPScore across various CLAP model variants and assessing multiple LALMs.
  Notably, even the best-performing CLAP-based ACEM achieves only a 70.01 F1-score on the BRACE-Main benchmark, while the best LALM reaches just 63.19.
  By revealing the limitations of CLAP models and LALMs, our BRACE benchmark offers valuable insights into the direction of future research.

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper examines the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into scientific peer review, highlighting two trends: individual reviewers using LLMs to reduce workload ("Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and institutional adoption of AI-powered review systems by entities such as AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science.  
2. It investigates the vulnerability of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems to adversarial manipulation targeting PDF submissions, with the goal of flipping rejection decisions to acceptance.  
3. The authors introduce a novel evaluation metric called the Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score (WAVS) to quantify the effectiveness of adversarial attacks in this context.  
4. A dataset of 200 scientific papers was compiled, and 15 domain-specific adversarial attack strategies were adapted and tested across 13 different LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek.  
5. Results reveal that obfuscation techniques like "Maximum Mark Magyk" can significantly manipulate review outcomes, causing high rates of decision flips even in large, advanced language models. The authors also commit to releasing their dataset and attack framework to support further research into securing LLM-based peer review systems. <div>

Abstract: The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the "Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic.

<div> Keywords: procedural memory, large language models, experience-driven evolution, memory refinement, lifelong learning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1) The paper addresses the limitations of current large language model (LLM) agents’ procedural memory systems, which predominantly use a passive, static accumulation approach that treats memory as a fixed archive.<br /><br />2) It introduces ReMe (Remember Me, Refine Me), a comprehensive framework designed to enable dynamic, experience-driven evolution of LLM agents through an active memory lifecycle.<br /><br />3) ReMe introduces three key mechanisms: multi-faceted distillation, which extracts detailed experience insights by recognizing patterns of success and failure; context-adaptive reuse, which customizes historical knowledge retrieval to new scenarios via scenario-aware indexing; and utility-based refinement, which autonomously adds useful memories while pruning outdated or irrelevant ones, keeping the memory pool efficient and high-quality.<br /><br />4) Experimental results on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld benchmarks demonstrate ReMe sets a new state-of-the-art for agent memory systems.<br /><br />5) Notably, integrating ReMe with a smaller LLM (Qwen3-8B) outperforms a much larger memoryless model (Qwen3-14B), exemplifying a significant memory-scaling effect that underscores the efficiency and lifelong learning potential of self-evolving memory mechanisms.<br /><br />The authors also release their code and a related dataset (reme.library) to support further research in this area. <div>

Abstract: Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize "how-to" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a "passive accumulation" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.

<title>Replace, Don't Expand: Mitigating Context Dilution in Multi-Hop RAG via Fixed-Budget Evidence Assembly</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, multi-hop queries, context dilution, SEAL-RAG, HotpotQA<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle with multi-hop queries because initial retrievals can miss crucial connecting facts, known as bridge facts. 2. Existing corrective methods like Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$ generally attempt to fix this by expanding the context or pruning retrieval lists, but expanding context risks causing context dilution where irrelevant distractors overshadow useful information. 3. The paper introduces SEAL-RAG, a training-free controller that employs a "replace, don't expand" approach to maintain a fixed retrieval depth ($k$) while combating context dilution. 4. SEAL-RAG runs a Search → Extract → Assess → Loop (SEAL) cycle, dynamically extracting entity-anchored gap specifications to identify missing entities or relations, then triggers focused micro-queries and uses entity-first ranking to replace distractors with gap-closing evidence. 5. On benchmarks HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA, SEAL-RAG shows significant improvements in answer accuracy and evidence precision over previous methods, including +3-13 percentage points in correctness and +12-18 in evidence precision on HotpotQA ($k=3$), and +8.0 pp accuracy with 96% evidence precision on 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), outperforming Adaptive-$k$ and CRAG distinctly. 6. By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL-RAG ensures predictable computational costs while optimizing for retrieval precision instead of breadth. 7. The authors provide code and data publicly at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.

<div> Social presence, multi-agent AI, CompanionCast, conversational evaluation, co-viewing experience  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the decline of social presence in modern solitary media consumption and explores whether multi-agent conversational AI can simulate shared viewing dynamics across various content types. The authors introduce CompanionCast, a versatile framework that orchestrates multiple role-specific AI agents to interact with video content through multimodal inputs, speech synthesis, and spatial audio. A unique feature of CompanionCast is the integration of an LLM-as-a-Judge module, which iteratively assesses and refines conversations on five key dimensions: relevance, authenticity, engagement, diversity, and personality consistency. The framework is validated in the context of sports viewing, specifically soccer, where a pilot study indicates that multi-agent interactions enhance the perceived social presence compared to solo viewing. Contributions include (1) a generalizable multi-agent conversational framework centered on multimodal video content, (2) a novel evaluator-agent pipeline to maintain and improve conversation quality, and (3) initial evidence supporting increased social presence through AI-mediated co-viewing. The authors also discuss the challenges encountered and suggest future research directions for adapting this approach to other viewing scenarios such as entertainment, education, and collaborative watching. <div>

Abstract: Social presence is central to the enjoyment of watching content together, yet modern media consumption is increasingly solitary. We investigate whether multi-agent conversational AI systems can recreate the dynamics of shared viewing experiences across diverse content types. We present CompanionCast, a general framework for orchestrating multiple role-specialized AI agents that respond to video content using multimodal inputs, speech synthesis, and spatial audio. Distinctly, CompanionCast integrates an LLM-as-a-Judge module that iteratively scores and refines conversations across five dimensions (relevance, authenticity, engagement, diversity, personality consistency). We validate this framework through sports viewing, a domain with rich dynamics and strong social traditions, where a pilot study with soccer fans suggests that multi-agent interaction improves perceived social presence compared to solo viewing. We contribute: (1) a generalizable framework for orchestrating multi-agent conversations around multimodal video content, (2) a novel evaluator-agent pipeline for conversation quality control, and (3) exploratory evidence of increased social presence in AI-mediated co-viewing. We discuss challenges and future directions for applying this approach to diverse viewing contexts including entertainment, education, and collaborative watching experiences.

<div> Keywords: LLM reasoning, rotary embeddings, real-time interaction, asynchronous processing, response latency reduction

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. Many advanced large language models (LLMs) use a "think before answering" approach, enhancing their reasoning capabilities and safety but limiting interactivity by requiring completion of internal processing before responding.  
2. This sequential reasoning process is incompatible with real-time, interactive environments such as voice assistants or embedded AI agents, which need to respond and adapt to new information continuously and without delays.  
3. Humans naturally think asynchronously—starting to process information while still listening and continuing to think during their response generation—allowing smoother and faster interactions.  
4. The paper introduces a novel method that leverages the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs designed for sequential reasoning to think, listen, and generate outputs simultaneously, without requiring any additional training.  
5. Evaluation on tasks involving mathematics, commonsense reasoning, and safety demonstrates that the approach can produce accurate, reasoning-augmented responses in real-time, significantly reducing the delay before the first token of the response to 5 seconds or less, and decreasing total latency by 6 to 11 times compared to traditional sequential interaction methods. <div>
arXiv:2512.10931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.

<div> Keywords: Dynamic Tanh, Derf, normalization-free, Transformer, generalization<br /><br />Summary: This paper challenges the long-held assumption that normalization layers are essential in deep learning architectures by exploring point-wise activation functions as alternatives. It builds upon the recent Dynamic Tanh (DyT) function, which stabilizes training by constraining extreme values and matches normalization methods in performance. The authors systematically investigate intrinsic properties of point-wise functions to understand their impact on training stability and model accuracy. Leveraging these insights, they perform a large-scale search for improved function designs and propose a novel function called Derf, defined as Derf(x) = erf(αx + s), where erf is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function. Experimental results demonstrate that Derf consistently outperforms common normalization techniques like LayerNorm and RMSNorm, as well as DyT, across diverse domains including image recognition, image generation, speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. The paper highlights that Derf’s advantage primarily arises from better generalization capabilities rather than enhanced fitting of training data. Its simplicity, coupled with superior empirical performance, renders Derf a promising and practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures, potentially simplifying model design and improving robustness. <div>

Abstract: Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \mathrm{erf}(\alpha x + s)$, where $\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation. Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1.

<div> Mental Health, Mental State Examination, Summarization, Language Models, Dataset  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Mental health disorders significantly impact the global population, with diagnoses often relying on structured Mental State Examinations (MSEs) that assess behavioral and cognitive functioning. In developing countries, limited access to mental health professionals creates a bottleneck in patient evaluation and care, as resident doctors face time constraints and extended patient wait times. This study tackles the problem of automating the generation of concise MSE summaries by evaluating various language models for summarization tasks. Due to a lack of publicly available relevant datasets, the researchers designed a 12-item descriptive MSE questionnaire and collected responses from 405 participants, resulting in 9720 utterances encompassing diverse mental health features. Five well-known pre-trained summarization models were tested both with and without fine-tuning to assess their ability to generate summaries from MSE data. The models were evaluated comprehensively using multiple metrics, including ROUGE, SummaC, and human judgments, demonstrating that language models can produce coherent and clinically useful summaries to support doctors in mental health diagnosis and monitoring. Importantly, the collected conversational dataset and trained models are released publicly, contributing valuable resources to the mental health research community and potentially improving accessibility and efficiency of mental health assessments worldwide. <div>

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect a significant portion of the global population, with diagnoses primarily conducted through Mental State Examinations (MSEs). MSEs serve as structured assessments to evaluate behavioral and cognitive functioning across various domains, aiding mental health professionals in diagnosis and treatment monitoring. However, in developing countries, access to mental health support is limited, leading to an overwhelming demand for mental health professionals. Resident doctors often conduct initial patient assessments and create summaries for senior doctors, but their availability is constrained, resulting in extended patient wait times.
  This study addresses the challenge of generating concise summaries from MSEs through the evaluation of various language models. Given the scarcity of relevant mental health conversation datasets, we developed a 12-item descriptive MSE questionnaire and collected responses from 405 participants, resulting in 9720 utterances covering diverse mental health aspects. Subsequently, we assessed the performance of five well-known pre-trained summarization models, both with and without fine-tuning, for summarizing MSEs. Our comprehensive evaluation, leveraging metrics such as ROUGE, SummaC, and human evaluation, demonstrates that language models can generate automated coherent MSE summaries for doctors. With this paper, we release our collected conversational dataset and trained models publicly for the mental health research community.

<title>The Spatial Semantics of Iconic Gesture</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Iconic gestures, spatial semantics, multimodal communication, linguistic meaning, gesture evaluation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses a key question in multimodal linguistic theory: the meaning of iconic gestures and how they combine with speech meaning. It proposes a clear separation between linguistic and visual levels of meaning. The authors introduce a spatial gesture semantics framework that bridges this gap, differentiating iconicity into three aspects. First, an iconic model interprets the form of a gesture by translating kinematic annotations into vector sequences. Second, a truth-functional evaluation embeds this iconic model in spatially extended domains, but since straightforward embedding is too rigid, they identify transformations such as rotation, scaling, perspective fixation, and handshape quotation to better capture meaning variations. Third, the linguistic or informational evaluation provides a heuristic classification of the iconic model, elevating gestures to a quasi-linguistic level that can interact with speech content. This interaction may either be non-substantive or governed by lexicon-driven inferences typical of dynamic semantic frameworks. Overall, the work provides a structured semantic theory for visual communication that systematically integrates gestures with verbal language, opening new avenues for analyzing multimodal discourse. <div>

Abstract: The current multimodal turn in linguistic theory leaves a crucial question unanswered: what is the meaning of iconic gestures, and how does it compose with speech meaning? We argue for a separation of linguistic and visual levels of meaning and introduce a spatial gesture semantics that closes this gap. Iconicity is differentiated into three aspects: Firstly, an interpretation of the form of a gesture in terms of a translation from kinematic gesture annotations into vector sequences (iconic model). Secondly, a truth-functional evaluation of the iconic model within spatially extended domains (embedding). Since a simple embedding is too strong, we identify a number of transformations that can be applied to iconic models, namely rotation, scaling, perspective fixation, and quotation of handshape. Thirdly, the linguistic description or classification of an iconic model (informational evaluation). Since the informational evaluation of an iconic gesture is a heuristic act, it needs a place in a semantic theory of visual communication. Informational evaluation lifts a gesture to a quasi-linguistic level that can interact with verbal content. This interaction is either vacuous, or regimented by usual lexicon-driven inferences discussed in dynamic semantic frameworks.

Abstract: Evaluating the cognitive capacities of large language models (LLMs) requires overcoming not only anthropomorphic but also anthropocentric biases. This article identifies two types of anthropocentric bias that have been neglected: overlooking how auxiliary factors can impede LLM performance despite competence ("auxiliary oversight"), and dismissing LLM mechanistic strategies that differ from those of humans as not genuinely competent ("mechanistic chauvinism"). Mitigating these biases necessitates an empirically-driven, iterative approach to mapping cognitive tasks to LLM-specific capacities and mechanisms, which can be done by supplementing carefully designed behavioral experiments with mechanistic studies.

<title>When Less Language is More: Language-Reasoning Disentanglement Makes LLMs Better Multilingual Reasoners</title>

Abstract: Multilingual reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), with performance disproportionately favoring high-resource languages. Drawing inspiration from cognitive neuroscience, which suggests that human reasoning functions largely independently of language processing, we hypothesize that LLMs similarly encode reasoning and language as separable components that can be disentangled to enhance multilingual reasoning. To evaluate this, we perform a causal intervention by ablating language-specific representations at inference time. Experiments on 10 open-weight LLMs spanning 11 typologically diverse languages show that this language-specific ablation consistently boosts multilingual reasoning performance. Layer-wise analyses further confirm that language and reasoning representations can be effectively disentangled throughout the model, yielding improved multilingual reasoning capabilities, while preserving top-layer language features remains essential for maintaining linguistic fidelity. Compared to post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, our training-free language-reasoning disentanglement achieves comparable or superior results with minimal computational overhead. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms underlying multilingual reasoning in LLMs and suggest a lightweight and interpretable strategy for improving cross-lingual generalization.

<title>Teaching Language Models to Evolve with Users: Dynamic Profile Modeling for Personalized Alignment</title>

Abstract: Personalized alignment is essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to engage effectively in user-centric dialogue. While recent prompt-based and offline optimization methods offer preliminary solutions, they fall short in cold-start scenarios and long-term personalization due to their inherently static and shallow designs. In this work, we introduce the Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Alignment (RLPA) framework, in which an LLM interacts with a simulated user model to iteratively infer and refine user profiles through dialogue. The training process is guided by a dual-level reward structure: the Profile Reward encourages accurate construction of user representations, while the Response Reward incentivizes generation of responses consistent with the inferred profile. We instantiate RLPA by fine-tuning Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, resulting in Qwen-RLPA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in personalized dialogue. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Qwen-RLPA consistently outperforms prompting and offline fine-tuning baselines, and even surpasses advanced commercial models such as Claude-3.5 and GPT-4o. Further analysis highlights Qwen-RLPA's robustness in reconciling conflicting user preferences, sustaining long-term personalization and delivering more efficient inference compared to recent reasoning-focused LLMs. These results emphasize the potential of dynamic profile inference as a more effective paradigm for building personalized dialogue systems.

<title>V-VAE: A Variational Auto Encoding Framework Towards Fine-Grained Control over Human-Like Chat</title>

Abstract: With the continued proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) based chatbots, there is a growing demand for generating responses that are not only linguistically fluent but also consistently aligned with persona-specific traits in conversations. However, existing role-play and persona-based chat approaches rely heavily on static role descriptions, coarse-grained signal space, and low-quality synthetic data, which fail to capture dynamic fine-grained details in human-like chat. Human-like chat requires modeling subtle latent traits, such as emotional tone, situational awareness, and evolving personality, which are difficult to predefine and cannot be easily learned from synthetic or distillation-based data. To address these limitations, we propose a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework, containing a variational auto-encoding module and fine-grained control space which dynamically adapts dialogue behaviour based on fine-grained, interpretable latent variables across talking style, interaction patterns, and personal attributes. We also construct a high-quality dataset, HumanChatData, and benchmark HumanChatBench to address the scarcity of high-quality data in the human-like domain. Experiments show that LLMs based on V-VAE consistently outperform standard baselines on HumanChatBench and DialogBench, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of V-VAE and HumanChatData.

<title>Better Language Model Inversion by Compactly Representing Next-Token Distributions</title>

Abstract: Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method -- prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace. This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving 2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on 16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than previously known.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks, we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep learning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) can autonomously conduct complex investigations and generate comprehensive reports, demonstrating strong real-world potential. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate DRAs on generic quality metrics and overlook personalization, a critical dimension for individual users. However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep Research Bench (PDR-Bench), the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user profiles that combine structured persona attributes with dynamic real-world contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures Personalization Alignment, Content Quality, and Factual Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for developing and evaluating the next generation of truly personalized AI research assistants.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals, highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly. These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs. However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next, we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments. TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval models.

Abstract: We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that progress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling parameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that inserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all pre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies and increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original functionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation, which maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented initialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative Adaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to acquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as SCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and SCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing between preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography benchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion while still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean corpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and competitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best overall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when preservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and adaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning setups.

Abstract: Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.

Abstract: LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.

Abstract: With the wide and cross-domain adoption of Large Language Models, it becomes crucial to assess to which extent the statistical correlations in training data, which underlie their impressive performance, hide subtle and potentially troubling biases. Gender bias in LLMs has been widely investigated from the perspectives of works, hobbies, and emotions typically associated with a specific gender. In this study, we introduce a novel perspective. We investigate whether LLMs can predict an individual's gender based solely on online shopping histories and whether these predictions are influenced by gender biases and stereotypes. Using a dataset of historical online purchases from users in the United States, we evaluate the ability of six LLMs to classify gender and we then analyze their reasoning and products-gender co-occurrences. Results indicate that while models can infer gender with moderate accuracy, their decisions are often rooted in stereotypical associations between product categories and gender. Furthermore, explicit instructions to avoid bias reduce the certainty of model predictions, but do not eliminate stereotypical patterns. Our findings highlight the persistent nature of gender biases in LLMs and emphasize the need for robust bias-mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) promise to accelerate biomedical discovery, yet their reliability remains unclear. We introduce ARIEL (AI Research Assistant for Expert-in-the-Loop Learning), an open-source evaluation and optimization framework that pairs a curated multimodal biomedical corpus with expert-vetted tasks to probe two capabilities: full-length article summarization and fine-grained figure interpretation. Using uniform protocols and blinded PhD-level evaluation, we find that state-of-the-art models generate fluent but incomplete summaries, whereas LMMs struggle with detailed visual reasoning. We later observe that prompt engineering and lightweight fine-tuning substantially improve textual coverage, and a compute-scaled inference strategy enhances visual question answering. We build an ARIEL agent that integrates textual and visual cues, and we show it can propose testable mechanistic hypotheses. ARIEL delineates current strengths and limitations of foundation models, and provides a reproducible platform for advancing trustworthy AI in biomedicine.

<title>Forensic deepfake audio detection using segmental speech features</title>

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using acoustic features of segmental speech sounds to detect deepfake audio. These features are highly interpretable because of their close relationship with human articulatory processes and are expected to be more difficult for deepfake models to replicate. The results demonstrate that certain segmental features commonly used in forensic voice comparison (FVC) are effective in identifying deep-fakes, whereas some global features provide little value. These findings underscore the need to approach audio deepfake detection using methods that are distinct from those employed in traditional FVC, and offer a new perspective on leveraging segmental features for this purpose. In addition, the present study proposes a speaker-specific framework for deepfake detection, which differs fundamentally from the speaker-independent systems that dominate current benchmarks. While speaker-independent frameworks aim at broad generalization, the speaker-specific approach offers advantages in forensic contexts where case-by-case interpretability and sensitivity to individual phonetic realization are essential.

<title>On the Design of KL-Regularized Policy Gradient Algorithms for LLM Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17508</link>

Abstract: Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective? We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a clipped-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO. We extend our experiments to 8K context length, and RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip achieves 52% accuracy on AIME25, surpassing the official Qwen3-4B-Instruct model (47%). Notably, RPG is a stable and scalable RL algorithm for LLM reasoning, realized via (a) a KL-correct objective, (b) clipped importance sampling, and (c) an iterative reference-policy update scheme.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically, POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in training LLMs.

<title>Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs on Recognition and Understanding over Chemical Tables</title>

Abstract: With the widespread application of multimodal large language models in scientific intelligence, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation benchmarks to assess their ability to understand complex scientific data. Scientific tables, as core carriers of knowledge representation, combine text, symbols, and graphics, forming a typical multimodal reasoning scenario. However, existing benchmarks are mostly focused on general domains, failing to reflect the unique structural complexity and domain-specific semantics inherent in scientific research. Chemical tables are particularly representative: they intertwine structured variables such as reagents, conditions, and yields with visual symbols like molecular structures and chemical formulas, posing significant challenges to models in cross-modal alignment and semantic parsing. To address this, we propose ChemTable-a large scale benchmark of chemical tables constructed from real-world literature, containing expert-annotated cell layouts, logical structures, and domain-specific labels. It supports two core tasks: (1) table recognition (structure and content extraction); and (2) table understanding (descriptive and reasoning-based question answering). Evaluation on ChemTable shows that while mainstream multimodal models perform reasonably well in layout parsing, they still face significant limitations when handling critical elements such as molecular structures and symbolic conventions. Closed-source models lead overall but still fall short of human-level performance. This work provides a realistic testing platform for evaluating scientific multimodal understanding, revealing the current bottlenecks in domain-specific reasoning and advancing the development of intelligent systems for scientific research.

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) aims to provide empathetic and effective emotional assistance through dialogue, addressing the growing demand for mental health support. This paper presents our solution for the NLPCC 2025 Task 8 ESC evaluation, where we leverage large-scale language models enhanced by prompt engineering and finetuning techniques. We explore both parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation and full-parameter fine-tuning strategies to improve the model's ability to generate supportive and contextually appropriate responses. Our best model ranked second in the competition, highlighting the potential of combining LLMs with effective adaptation methods for ESC tasks. Future work will focus on further enhancing emotional understanding and response personalization to build more practical and reliable emotional support systems.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans, among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more samples from multiple raters for each example greatly increases the per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$ configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N \times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and $N$, or if one even existed, depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work, we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

Abstract: We introduce Meta Agents Research Environments (ARE), a research platform for scalable creation of environments, integration of synthetic or real applications, and execution of agentic orchestrations. ARE provides simple abstractions to build complex and diverse environments, each with their own rules, tools, content, and verifiers, helping to bridge the gap between model development and real-world deployment. We also propose Gaia2, a benchmark built in ARE and designed to measure general agent capabilities. Beyond search and execution, Gaia2 requires agents to handle ambiguities and noise, adapt to dynamic environments, collaborate with other agents, and operate under temporal constraints. Unlike prior benchmarks, Gaia2 runs asynchronously, surfacing new failure modes that are invisible in static settings. Our experiments show that no system dominates across the intelligence spectrum: stronger reasoning often comes at the cost of efficiency, and budget scaling curves plateau, highlighting the need for new architectures and adaptive compute strategies. Perhaps more importantly, ARE abstractions enable continuous extension of Gaia2 to other environments, empowering the community to rapidly create new benchmarks tailored to their domains. In AI's second half, progress increasingly depends on defining meaningful tasks and robust evaluations to drive frontier capabilities forward.

Abstract: Computer-use agents face a fundamental limitation. They rely exclusively on primitive GUI actions (click, type, scroll), creating brittle execution chains prone to cascading failures. While API-driven agents harness rich capabilities through structured interfaces and tools, computer-use agents remain constrained to low-level visual interactions. We present UltraCUA, a foundation model that transcends this limitation through hybrid action-seamlessly unifying primitive GUI operations with high-level tool execution. Our innovation rests on four critical advances. First, an automated pipeline extracts and scales tool capabilities from software documentation and code repositories. Second, a synthetic data engine produces 17,000+ verifiable tasks capturing real-world computer-use complexity. Third, comprehensive hybrid action trajectory collection incorporates both GUI primitives and strategic tool calls. Fourth, a two-stage training methodology combines supervised fine-tuning with online reinforcement learning, enabling intelligent action selection between GUI and API. Evaluation with our 7B and 32B UltraCUA models reveals transformative performance gains. On OSWorld, UltraCUA achieves 22% relative improvement while executing 11% faster than existing approaches, averagely. Cross-domain validation on WindowsAgentArena demonstrates robust generalization with 21.7% success rate, surpassing Windows-trained baselines. The hybrid action paradigm proves essential, reducing error propagation while improving execution efficiency. This work establishes a scalable paradigm bridging primitive GUI interactions and high-level tool intelligence, enabling more resilient and adaptable computer use agents for diverse environments and complex real-world tasks.

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

<div> Abstractive Compression, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Noise Robustness, Data Augmentation, Positional Bias<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of irrelevant and misleading information in retrieved documents used for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), noting that abstractive compression models tend to omit crucial details needed for correct answers, particularly in long contexts with dispersed attention. The authors categorize retrieved documents more finely to better handle various retrieval noises. They propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), a method featuring two novel training steps. First, offline data augmentation is applied to enhance the compressor's robustness against two distinct retrieval noise types. Second, the compressor is fine-tuned to generate summaries that focus on key information directly supporting the correct answer, mitigating positional bias and improving multi-document information utilization. Experiments show that T5-large models trained with ACoRN improve exact match (EM) and F1 scores while preserving answer strings, which can provide direct evidence. ACoRN is particularly effective on datasets containing many accuracy-reducing documents, highlighting its practical utility in real-world RAG systems. <div>

Abstract: Abstractive compression utilizes smaller langauge models to condense query-relevant context, reducing computational costs in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, retrieved documents often include information that is either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language model based compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor, improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy reducing documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, hallucination, large language models, factual trustworthiness, question answering<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article addresses the challenge that reinforcement learning (RL) enhances reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but simultaneously increases their tendency to hallucinate, causing a trade-off between capability and reliability. The authors introduce a targeted RL framework designed to reduce both intrinsic hallucinations, which involve unfaithfulness to context, and extrinsic hallucinations, which involve flawed internal knowledge, particularly in short and long-form question answering tasks. To mitigate extrinsic hallucinations, the study creates a novel training dataset derived from open-ended conversions of TriviaQA. Intrinsic hallucinations are tackled by incorporating long-form texts from FineWeb using a fact-grounding reward mechanism. The framework also explicitly incentivizes the model to abstain from answering questions deemed unanswerable, fostering cautiousness and improving reliability. Extensive experiments on a variety of benchmarks show significant performance improvements and a substantial reduction in both types of hallucination. Ultimately, this research contributes a practical and effective method to balance advanced reasoning abilities with factual trustworthiness, enabling the development of more capable and reliable LLMs. <div>

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has unlocked unprecedented complex reasoning in large language models, it has also amplified their propensity for hallucination, creating a critical trade-off between capability and reliability. This work confronts this challenge by introducing a targeted RL framework designed to mitigate both intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations across short and long-form question answering. We address extrinsic hallucinations (flawed internal knowledge) by creating a novel training set from open-ended conversions of TriviaQA. Concurrently, we tackle intrinsic hallucinations (unfaithfulness to context) by leveraging long-form texts from FineWeb in a fact-grounding reward scheme. To further bolster reliability, our framework explicitly rewards the model for refusing to answer unanswerable questions, thereby cultivating crucial cautiousness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methodology yields significant performance gains across a diverse suite of benchmarks, substantially reducing both hallucination types. Ultimately, this research contributes a practical framework for resolving the critical tension between advanced reasoning and factual trustworthiness, paving the way for more capable and reliable large language models.

<title>The Linguistic Architecture of Reflective Thought: Evaluation of a Large Language Model as a Tool to Isolate the Formal Structure of Mentalization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Mentalization, Large Language Models, Mentalization-Based Treatment, linguistic structure, psychiatric evaluation<br /><br />Summary:  
This study explores the capacity of a single Large Language Model (LLM) to emulate the linguistic structure central to mentalization, a process integrating cognitive, affective, and intersubjective components. The research specifically evaluates the LLM’s output against parameters defined by Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT). To do so, fifty dialogues were generated involving human participants interacting with the LLM set in standard mode. Five psychiatrists trained in MBT independently assessed these dialogues under blinded conditions, rating them on four MBT axes according to evaluative coherence, argumentative coherence, and overall quality using Likert scales. Inter-rater reliability was calculated through ICC(3,1), yielding substantial to high agreement (0.60-0.84), confirming consistency among evaluators. The mean scores ranged between 3.63 and 3.98, with moderate variability, indicating a substantial degree of structural coherence in the LLM-generated mentalization profiles. The model showed particular stability in differentiating Implicit-Explicit and Self-Other dimensions but was less effective at integrating internal emotional states with external contextual factors. While the profiles produced were coherent and clinically interpretable, they tended to demonstrate affective neutrality, reflecting a limitation in conveying emotional depth. Overall, the findings highlight both the promise and current constraints of LLMs in replicating complex aspects of mentalization within psychiatric frameworks. <div>

Abstract: Background: Mentalization integrates cognitive, affective, and intersubjective components. Large Language Models (LLMs) display an increasing ability to generate reflective texts, raising questions regarding the relationship between linguistic form and mental representation. This study assesses the extent to which a single LLM can reproduce the linguistic structure of mentalization according to the parameters of Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT).
  Methods: Fifty dialogues were generated between human participants and an LLM configured in standard mode. Five psychiatrists trained in MBT, working under blinded conditions, evaluated the mentalization profiles produced by the model along the four MBT axes, assigning Likert-scale scores for evaluative coherence, argumentative coherence, and global quality. Inter-rater agreement was estimated using ICC(3,1).
  Results: Mean scores (3.63-3.98) and moderate standard deviations indicate a high level of structural coherence in the generated profiles. ICC values (0.60-0.84) show substantial-to-high agreement among raters. The model proved more stable in the Implicit-Explicit and Self-Other dimensions, while presenting limitations in the integration of internal states and external contexts. The profiles were coherent and clinically interpretable yet characterized by affective neutrality.

<div> Keywords: Luxical, lexical-dense embeddings, text organization, knowledge distillation, web-scale corpora<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper introduces Luxical, a novel library designed to generate high-speed "lexical-dense" text embeddings that combine benefits of both sparse lexical classifiers and dense transformer embeddings.<br /><br />2. Luxical leverages sparse TF–IDF features and a small ReLU neural network, trained through a knowledge distillation regimen to approximate large transformer embedding models at significantly reduced computational costs.<br /><br />3. The approach aims to address the challenge of organizing vast web-scale text corpora efficiently for language model training, balancing speed, flexibility, and embedding quality.<br /><br />4. Evaluation of Luxical includes two different tasks: a targeted web-crawl document retrieval and an end-to-end language model data curation task based on text classification.<br /><br />5. Results demonstrate that Luxical achieves speed improvements ranging from 3x to 100x over neural baseline models and matches FastText speeds, while maintaining comparable embedding quality to larger neural models, making it a strong choice for large-scale text organization.<br /><br />6. The library is open-source and available for community use and further development at the provided GitHub repository. <div>
arXiv:2512.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier language model quality increasingly hinges on our ability to organize web-scale text corpora for training. Today's dominant tools trade off speed and flexibility: lexical classifiers (e.g., FastText) are fast but limited to producing classification output scores, while the vector-valued outputs of transformer text embedding models flexibly support numerous workflows (e.g., clustering, classification, and retrieval) but are computationally expensive to produce. We introduce Luxical, a library for high-speed "lexical-dense" text embeddings that aims to recover the best properties of both approaches for web-scale text organization. Luxical combines sparse TF--IDF features, a small ReLU network, and a knowledge distillation training regimen to approximate large transformer embedding models at a fraction of their operational cost. In this technical report, we describe the Luxical architecture and training objective and evaluate a concrete Luxical model in two disparate applications: a targeted webcrawl document retrieval test and an end-to-end language model data curation task grounded in text classification. In these tasks we demonstrate speedups ranging from 3x to 100x over varying-sized neural baselines, and comparable to FastText model inference during the data curation task. On these evaluations, the tested Luxical model illustrates favorable compute/quality trade-offs for large-scale text organization, matching the quality of neural baselines. Luxical is available as open-source software at https://github.com/datologyai/luxical.

<title>Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model for Automatic Pediatric Dental Record Understanding and Safe Antibiotic Recommendation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: pediatric dental informatics, knowledge-guided LLM, antibiotic prescribing, safety validation, retrieval-augmented generation<br /><br />Summary: This study addresses challenges in interpreting pediatric dental clinical records and ensuring safe antibiotic prescribing by introducing a Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model (KG-LLM). The KG-LLM integrates a pediatric dental knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a multi-stage safety validation pipeline to provide evidence-grounded antibiotic recommendations. Initially, a clinical named entity recognition and relation extraction (NER/RE) module structures information from dental notes and radiology reports. Then, relevant guidelines, drug-safety rules, and similar historical cases are retrieved from the knowledge graph and fed into the LLM for diagnostic summaries and drug dose-duration predictions. Safety assurance is provided via a dual-layer validation mechanism combining deterministic rule checks with a learned classifier to detect allergies, contraindications, and dosing errors. Experiments on 32,000 de-identified pediatric dental records demonstrate that KG-LLM surpasses a domain-adapted Llama-2 baseline in record understanding (F1 0.914 vs. 0.867), drug dose-duration accuracy (Top-1 0.782 vs. 0.716), and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 50%. Evaluations on summary quality, recommendation accuracy, and overall safety validate the model’s robustness. Ablation studies confirm that the knowledge graph, RAG, and safety modules each significantly enhance clinical reliability and interpretability. <div>

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of pediatric dental clinical records and safe antibiotic prescribing remain persistent challenges in dental informatics. Traditional rule-based clinical decision support systems struggle with unstructured dental narratives, incomplete radiographic descriptions, and complex safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model (KG-LLM) that integrates a pediatric dental knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a multi-stage safety validation pipeline for evidence-grounded antibiotic recommendation. The framework first employs a clinical NER/RE module to extract structured entities and relations from dental notes and radiology reports. Relevant guidelines, drug-safety rules, and analogous historical cases are subsequently retrieved from the knowledge graph and supplied to the LLM for diagnostic summarization and dose-drug-duration prediction. Safety assurance is achieved through a dual-layer validation mechanism combining deterministic rule checking with a learned classifier for detecting allergies, contraindications, and dosing errors. Experiments on 32,000 de-identified pediatric dental visit records demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with a domain-adapted Llama-2 clinical baseline, KG-LLM improves record-understanding performance (F1: 0.914 vs. 0.867), drug-dose-duration accuracy (Top-1: 0.782 vs. 0.716), and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 50%. Additional evaluation across summary quality, recommendation accuracy, and global safety scores further confirms the robustness of the system. Ablation analyses indicate that the knowledge graph, RAG, and safety modules each contribute substantially to clinical reliability and interpretability.

<div> GraphRAG, hallucination, interpretability metrics, Path Reliance Degree, Semantic Alignment Score  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), a method that improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge from linearized subgraphs retrieved from knowledge graphs. However, LLMs often struggle to correctly interpret the relational and topological information within these inputs, leading to hallucinations that conflict with the retrieved knowledge. To better understand this issue, the authors propose two lightweight interpretability metrics: Path Reliance Degree (PRD), which measures the model's overdependence on shortest-path triples, and Semantic Alignment Score (SAS), which evaluates how well the model's internal representations align semantically with the retrieved knowledge. Through empirical evaluation on a knowledge-based question answering task, they find that high PRD and low SAS scores correspond with failure modes such as over-reliance on salient paths and weak semantic grounding. To address hallucinations, the paper presents a lightweight post-hoc hallucination detector called Graph Grounding and Alignment (GGA), which surpasses existing semantic and confidence-based baselines in both AUC and F1 metrics. By applying mechanistic interpretability, this work sheds light on how structural shortcomings in LLMs cause hallucinations and offers guidance for designing more reliable GraphRAG systems. <div>

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge from linearized subgraphs retrieved from knowledge graphs. However, LLMs struggle to interpret the relational and topological information in these inputs, resulting in hallucinations that are inconsistent with the retrieved knowledge. To analyze how LLMs attend to and retain structured knowledge during generation, we propose two lightweight interpretability metrics: Path Reliance Degree (PRD), which measures over-reliance on shortest-path triples, and Semantic Alignment Score (SAS), which assesses how well the model's internal representations align with the retrieved knowledge. Through empirical analysis on a knowledge-based QA task, we identify failure patterns associated with over-reliance on salient paths and weak semantic grounding, as indicated by high PRD and low SAS scores. We further develop a lightweight post-hoc hallucination detector, Graph Grounding and Alignment (GGA), which outperforms strong semantic and confidence-based baselines across AUC and F1. By grounding hallucination analysis in mechanistic interpretability, our work offers insights into how structural limitations in LLMs contribute to hallucinations, informing the design of more reliable GraphRAG systems in the future.

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. This study explores the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to absorb and exhibit personality traits and attitudes as specified by users.  
2. Researchers adapted the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), a widely used psychological assessment tool, to evaluate LLMs' behavior and identify personality traits.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to absorb and reflect personality traits and attitudes specified by users. In our study, we investigated this potential using robust psychometric measures. We adapted the most studied test in psychological literature, namely Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and examined LLMs' behavior to identify traits. To asses the sensitivity of LLMs' prompts and psychological biases we created personality-oriented prompts, crafting a detailed set of personas that vary in trait intensity. This enables us to measure how well LLMs follow these roles. Our study introduces MindShift, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' psychological adaptability. The results highlight a consistent improvement in LLMs' role perception, attributed to advancements in training datasets and alignment techniques. Additionally, we observe significant differences in responses to psychometric assessments across different model types and families, suggesting variability in their ability to emulate human-like personality traits. MindShift prompts and code for LLM evaluation will be publicly available.

<title>Targeting Misalignment: A Conflict-Aware Framework for Reward-Model-based LLM Alignment</title>

<div> Reward models, alignment, proxy-policy conflict, human-in-the-loop, large language models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences through fine-tuning on reward models, recognizing that current proxy reward models often fail due to noise, bias, or limited coverage.  
2. It identifies a key problem where models optimize flawed reward signals rather than true human values, leading to misalignment and undesirable behaviors.  
3. To tackle this, the authors propose viewing the fine-tuning process as knowledge integration and focus on detecting proxy-policy conflicts, where the base model strongly disagrees with the proxy reward model, which can indicate shared ignorance.  
4. Two novel metrics are introduced: the localized Proxy-Policy Alignment Conflict Score (PACS) and a global Kendall-Tau Distance, aimed at identifying these conflicts effectively.  
5. Building on these metrics, the paper presents SHF-CAS, an algorithm that selectively samples high-conflict questions for human feedback, thereby improving both the reward model and policy with greater efficiency.  
6. Empirical results on two alignment tasks show that this method improves overall alignment performance, even when the proxy reward model is biased.  
7. The work offers a fresh perspective on interpreting alignment failures and provides a principled approach for targeted refinement in LLM fine-tuning strategies. <div>
arXiv:2512.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward-model-based fine-tuning is a central paradigm in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences. However, such approaches critically rely on the assumption that proxy reward models accurately reflect intended supervision, a condition often violated due to annotation noise, bias, or limited coverage. This misalignment can lead to undesirable behaviors, where models optimize for flawed signals rather than true human values. In this paper, we investigate a novel framework to identify and mitigate such misalignment by treating the fine-tuning process as a form of knowledge integration. We focus on detecting instances of proxy-policy conflicts, cases where the base model strongly disagrees with the proxy. We argue that such conflicts often signify areas of shared ignorance, where neither the policy nor the reward model possesses sufficient knowledge, making them especially susceptible to misalignment. To this end, we propose two complementary metrics for identifying these conflicts: a localized Proxy-Policy Alignment Conflict Score (PACS) and a global Kendall-Tau Distance measure. Building on this insight, we design an algorithm named Selective Human-in-the-loop Feedback via Conflict-Aware Sampling (SHF-CAS) that targets high-conflict QA pairs for additional feedback, refining both the reward model and policy efficiently. Experiments on two alignment tasks demonstrate that our approach enhances general alignment performance, even when trained with a biased proxy reward. Our work provides a new lens for interpreting alignment failures and offers a principled pathway for targeted refinement in LLM training.

<title>CORE: A Conceptual Reasoning Layer for Large Language Models</title>

<div> Keywords: Large language models, multi-turn interactions, concept-first, Local Concept, cognitive operators<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Large language models (LLMs) typically perform well in single-turn tasks but encounter challenges in multi-turn interactions, as they must reconstruct user intent and task state from an increasingly long token history. This token-first approach causes issues like prompt bloat, inconsistent reasoning, and context drift over extended conversations. To address these problems, the authors propose CORE, a concept-first interaction layer designed to improve multi-turn stability without altering the underlying model weights. CORE leverages a small set of universal cognitive operators alongside a persistent Local Concept—a compact semantic representation capturing essential information such as task details, constraints, user preferences, and intermediate results. Instead of feeding the entire conversation history into the model, each invocation uses only this Local Concept, the latest user input, and the chosen operator. This streamlined input reduces the need for replaying extensive context tokens. Preliminary prototype experiments simulating CORE's workflow demonstrated approximately a 42% reduction in cumulative prompt tokens, though this figure is subject to prototype-specific conditions and does not represent definitive real-world performance gains. Ultimately, CORE offers a model-agnostic framework that decouples conceptual reasoning from language generation, providing a promising and scalable path toward more robust multi-turn dialogue systems. <div>
arXiv:2512.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models handle single-turn generation well, but multi-turn interactions still require the model to reconstruct user intent and task state from an expanding token history because internal representations do not persist across turns. This token-first paradigm leads to drift, inconsistent reasoning modes, and growing prompts as conversations deepen. We propose CORE, a concept-first interaction layer that improves multi-turn stability without modifying model weights. CORE combines a small library of universal cognitive operators with a persistent Local Concept - a compact semantic state capturing the task, constraints, preferences, and intermediate results. Each model call receives only this concept state, the user's latest instruction, and the selected operator, eliminating the need to replay full history. A preliminary prototype simulating CORE's behavior shows about 42% reduction in cumulative prompt tokens, though this number reflects prototype conditions and should not be interpreted as a real-world performance estimate. CORE offers a model-agnostic mechanism that separates conceptual reasoning from language generation, suggesting a scalable direction for more stable multi-turn systems.

<div> Large Language Models, Self-attention, Sparse attention, Long-context inference, Efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the computational and memory challenges posed by the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism in Large Language Models when dealing with extremely long sequences. The authors propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a novel sparse attention mechanism that does not require additional training or architectural modifications. TCA-Attention operates in two lightweight phases: an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets through a single forward pass, and an online token selection phase that adaptively retains only the most informative tokens based on a redundancy metric. This method provides a unified solution that speeds up both prefilling and decoding stages while significantly reducing the KV cache memory footprint. Theoretical analysis confirms that the approximation error remains bounded. Experimentally, TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8× speedup and a 61% reduction in KV cache usage at a 128K context length. Importantly, these efficiency gains come without sacrificing performance, as results remain comparable to full attention across various benchmarks. Overall, TCA-Attention offers a practical, plug-and-play approach for efficient long-context inference in Large Language Models. <div>
arXiv:2512.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. These capabilities stem primarily from the self-attention mechanism, which enables modeling of long-range dependencies. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length poses significant computational and memory challenges, especially as sequence length extends to extremes. While various sparse attention and KV cache compression methods have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as reliance on fixed patterns, inability to handle both prefilling and decoding stages, or the requirement for additional training. In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8$\times$ speedup and reduces KV cache by 61% at 128K context length while maintaining performance comparable to full attention across various benchmarks, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for efficient long-context inference.

<div> bias, machine-generated text detection, English-language learners, socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic bias<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study investigates biases in English machine-generated text detection systems by analyzing a dataset of student essays across four attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English-language learner (ELL) status, and economic status. Sixteen detection systems were evaluated using regression models to measure the significance and strength of bias effects, complemented by subgroup analyses. The findings reveal that biases vary inconsistently across different detection systems but highlight critical issues: disadvantaged groups are often misclassified as machine-generated; essays from ELL students are more frequently flagged as machine-generated; economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated; and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately misclassified compared to White ELL essays. Additionally, human annotators were tested on the detection task and, despite generally low accuracy, did not display significant biases related to these attributes. The study underscores the need for careful bias assessment in detection tools to prevent unfair treatment of marginalized groups and calls for improvements in machine-generated text detection to mitigate adverse impacts on vulnerable populations. <div>
arXiv:2512.09292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meteoric rise in text generation capability has been accompanied by parallel growth in interest in machine-generated text detection: the capability to identify whether a given text was generated using a model or written by a person. While detection models show strong performance, they have the capacity to cause significant negative impacts. We explore potential biases in English machine-generated text detection systems. We curate a dataset of student essays and assess 16 different detection systems for bias across four attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English-language learner (ELL) status, and economic status. We evaluate these attributes using regression-based models to determine the significance and power of the effects, as well as performing subgroup analysis. We find that while biases are generally inconsistent across systems, there are several key issues: several models tend to classify disadvantaged groups as machine-generated, ELL essays are more likely to be classified as machine-generated, economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated, and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately classified as machine-generated relative to their White counterparts. Finally, we perform human annotation and find that while humans perform generally poorly at the detection task, they show no significant biases on the studied attributes.

<div> Keywords: continual routing, computation strategies, modular predictor, multi-representation, AI task optimization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. AI tasks vary in their complexity and require different computational approaches, such as combinations of models and decoding methods, making effective routing to appropriate strategies essential.<br />2. Existing routing methods typically train a single model across all strategies, necessitating full retraining with the introduction of new strategies and causing high computational overhead.<br />3.

CONCUR utilizes multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to capture the problem complexity better.<br />6. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CONCUR surpasses the best individual strategies and strong existing routing methods in accuracy and inference efficiency for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks.<br />7. Moreover, CONCUR reduces training cost under continual learning settings and performs effectively in both constrained and unconstrained routing scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2512.09386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI tasks differ in complexity and are best addressed with different computation strategies (e.g., combinations of models and decoding methods). Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting.

The paper introduces CourtPressGER, a novel dataset comprising 6,400 triples that include German highest courts' rulings, their corresponding human-written official press releases, and synthetic prompts designed for large language models (LLMs) to generate comparable summaries.  
2. Unlike previous NLP works that focus largely on technical headnotes, this dataset addresses the communication needs of the general public by focusing on citizen-oriented judicial press releases.  
3. CourtPressGER serves as a benchmark to train and evaluate the performance of both small and large LLMs in producing accurate, readable summaries from extensive judicial texts.  
4. The study benchmarks various LLMs using multiple evaluation methods such as reference-based metrics, factual-consistency verification, LLM-as-judge assessments, and expert human rankings to gauge summary quality.  
5. Results indicate that large language models are capable of generating high-quality draft press releases with only minimal degradation in hierarchical performance, while smaller models benefit significantly from hierarchical setups when handling long court judgments. Nonetheless, human-authored press releases continue to rank highest in quality compared to machine-generated outputs. <div>

Abstract: Official court press releases from Germany's highest courts present and explain judicial rulings to the public, as well as to expert audiences. Prior NLP efforts emphasize technical headnotes, ignoring citizen-oriented communication needs. We introduce CourtPressGER, a 6.4k dataset of triples: rulings, human-drafted press releases, and synthetic prompts for LLMs to generate comparable releases. This benchmark trains and evaluates LLMs in generating accurate, readable summaries from long judicial texts. We benchmark small and large LLMs using reference-based metrics, factual-consistency checks, LLM-as-judge, and expert ranking. Large LLMs produce high-quality drafts with minimal hierarchical performance loss; smaller models require hierarchical setups for long judgments. Initial benchmarks show varying model performance, with human-drafted releases ranking highest.

<div> Keywords: explainable reasoning, financial decision-making, knowledge-enhanced LLM, semantic representation, multi-head attention<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study proposes an explainable reasoning approach for financial decision-making using knowledge-enhanced large language model (LLM) agents to overcome traditional methods' limitations such as reliance on parameterized knowledge, lack of factual consistency, and absence of reasoning chains. The framework integrates external knowledge retrieval, semantic representation, and reasoning generation by encoding financial texts and structured data to obtain semantic representations. It retrieves pertinent information from external knowledge bases via similarity computation and combines this with internal representations through weighted fusion, enhancing factual accuracy and content completeness while maintaining fluency. A multi-head attention mechanism constructs logical reasoning chains, enabling transparent causal relationships and traceability during output generation. The model jointly optimizes for task performance and explanation consistency, improving both predictive accuracy and interpretability of reasoning. Experimental evaluation on financial text processing and decision tasks demonstrates superior performance relative to baseline methods in accuracy, text generation quality, and factual support. The approach effectively addresses semantic coverage gaps and reasoning transparency issues typical of traditional models. Ultimately, this method shows strong practical applicability in complex financial environments by providing explainability alongside robust decision-making capabilities. <div>

Abstract: This study investigates an explainable reasoning method for financial decision-making based on knowledge-enhanced large language model agents. To address the limitations of traditional financial decision methods that rely on parameterized knowledge, lack factual consistency, and miss reasoning chains, an integrated framework is proposed that combines external knowledge retrieval, semantic representation, and reasoning generation. The method first encodes financial texts and structured data to obtain semantic representations, and then retrieves task-related information from external knowledge bases using similarity computation. Internal representations and external knowledge are combined through weighted fusion, which ensures fluency while improving factual accuracy and completeness of generated content. In the reasoning stage, a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to construct logical chains, allowing the model to present transparent causal relationships and traceability during generation. Finally, the model jointly optimizes task objectives and explanation consistency objectives, which enhances predictive performance and reasoning interpretability. Experiments on financial text processing and decision tasks show that the method outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, text generation quality, and factual support, verifying the effectiveness of knowledge enhancement and explainable reasoning. Overall, the proposed approach overcomes the limitations of traditional models in semantic coverage and reasoning transparency, and demonstrates strong practical value in complex financial scenarios.

<div> Keywords: text classification, large language models, attention mechanism, class imbalance, semantic embeddings<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study proposes a novel text classification algorithm leveraging large language models to overcome limitations of traditional methods in capturing long-range dependencies, understanding contextual semantics, and managing class imbalance. The framework is structured in several stages: text encoding, contextual representation modeling, attention-based enhancement, feature aggregation, and classification prediction. Deep semantic embeddings are derived from large-scale pretrained language models, and attention mechanisms are employed to selectively emphasize key features for improved representation. In the aggregation phase, a combination of global and weighted strategies produces robust text-level vectors. Classification is performed using a fully connected layer followed by a Softmax output layer, optimized via cross-entropy loss. Comparative experiments benchmark the proposed method against recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and Transformer models, evaluated on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC metrics. Results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed approach across all metrics, particularly in Recall and AUC. Sensitivity analyses explore the effects of hidden dimension size on AUC and class imbalance ratios on Recall, underscoring the importance of proper hyperparameter tuning. The study highlights the model’s adaptability and stability under varying data conditions, ultimately validating its robustness and effectiveness for complex real-world text classification tasks. <div>

<div> Keywords: LLM-based Search Engines, Traditional Search Engines, citation transparency, source diversity, credibility metrics  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper explores the emerging paradigm of LLM-based Search Engines (LLM-SEs) that differ from Traditional Search Engines (TSEs) like Google by summarizing search results but often at the cost of citation transparency. The authors conduct a large-scale empirical study analyzing 55,936 queries and their results across six LLM-SEs and two TSEs. The study reveals that LLM-SEs cite a more diverse set of domain sources compared to TSEs, with 37% of these domains being unique to LLM-SEs, highlighting their potential to broaden the range of accessed information. Despite this increased diversity, LLM-SEs do not surpass TSEs in terms of credibility, political neutrality, and safety, indicating persistent risks when relying on such systems. To investigate how LLM-SEs select sources, a feature-based analysis is performed to identify the main factors that influence their citation choices. The findings provide valuable insights for various stakeholders including end users, website owners, and developers, emphasizing the need for improved transparency and reliability in LLM-SEs to foster trust and effective information seeking. <div>

Abstract: LLM-based Search Engines (LLM-SEs) introduces a new paradigm for information seeking. Unlike Traditional Search Engines (TSEs) (e.g., Google), these systems summarize results, often providing limited citation transparency. The implications of this shift remain largely unexplored, yet raises key questions regarding trust and transparency. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of LLM-SEs, analyzing 55,936 queries and the corresponding search results across six LLM-SEs and two TSEs. We confirm that LLM-SEs cites domain resources with greater diversity than TSEs. Indeed, 37% of domains are unique to LLM-SEs. However, certain risks still persist: LLM-SEs do not outperform TSEs in credibility, political neutrality and safety metrics. Finally, to understand the selection criteria of LLM-SEs, we perform a feature-based analysis to identify key factors influencing source choice. Our findings provide actionable insights for end users, website owners, and developers.

<title>RouteRAG: Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation from Text and Graph via Reinforcement Learning</title>

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Reinforcement Learning, Hybrid Retrieval, Multi-turn Reasoning, Large Language Models<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating both textual and graph-structured information into Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved multi-turn reasoning using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While previous work on text-based RAG has leveraged Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning capabilities, extending these benefits to hybrid retrieval systems that combine text and graphs presents additional difficulties. Traditional graph or hybrid retrieval methods often rely on fixed or handcrafted pipelines, limiting their flexibility and ability to adaptively gather supplementary evidence during reasoning. Moreover, retrieving graph-based evidence is computationally expensive. To overcome these issues, the authors propose \model{}, an RL-driven framework that enables LLMs to dynamically decide when to reason, which source to retrieve evidence from (text or graph), and when to output final answers through a unified generation policy. The training framework is designed in two stages, optimizing for both task success and retrieval efficiency, which helps reduce unnecessary retrieval overhead. Experiments on five question-answering benchmarks show that \model{} significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of end-to-end reinforcement learning in enabling adaptive, efficient hybrid retrieval for complex multi-hop reasoning tasks. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates non-parametric knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), typically from unstructured texts and structured graphs. While recent progress has advanced text-based RAG to multi-turn reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (RL), extending these advances to hybrid retrieval introduces additional challenges. Existing graph-based or hybrid systems typically depend on fixed or handcrafted retrieval pipelines, lacking the ability to integrate supplementary evidence as reasoning unfolds. Besides, while graph evidence provides relational structures crucial for multi-hop reasoning, it is substantially more expensive to retrieve. To address these limitations, we introduce \model{}, an RL-based framework that enables LLMs to perform multi-turn and adaptive graph-text hybrid RAG. \model{} jointly optimizes the entire generation process via RL, allowing the model to learn when to reason, what to retrieve from either texts or graphs, and when to produce final answers, all within a unified generation policy. To guide this learning process, we design a two-stage training framework that accounts for both task outcome and retrieval efficiency, enabling the model to exploit hybrid evidence while avoiding unnecessary retrieval overhead. Experimental results across five question answering benchmarks demonstrate that \model{} significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines, highlighting the benefits of end-to-end RL in supporting adaptive and efficient retrieval for complex reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, methodological frameworks, prompt-based interaction, fine-tuning, embeddings extraction  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study addresses the existing challenges in deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) within language sciences, particularly focusing on the issues of methodological fragmentation and lack of systematic rigor. First, it introduces a method-selection framework that categorizes three distinct yet complementary approaches to utilizing LLMs according to specific research goals: (1) prompt-based interaction with general-purpose models for exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation; (2) fine-tuning open-source models aimed at confirmatory, theory-driven research and producing high-quality datasets; and (3) extracting contextualized embeddings to enable detailed quantitative analysis and investigation of internal model workings. Each method’s technical details, implementation strategies, and inherent trade-offs are elaborated with supporting empirical case studies. Building on this, a second framework is presented to guide the construction of multi-stage research pipelines that strategically combine these approaches for practical execution. The authors further validate the proposed frameworks through various empirical experiments, including retrospective analysis, prospective application, and expert survey evaluations. By promoting alignment between research questions and appropriate LLM methodologies, these frameworks aim to transform language science research into a more reproducible, critically evaluated, and robust scientific discipline, shifting it away from ad-hoc usage toward verifiable, systematic approaches. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming language sciences. However, their widespread deployment currently suffers from methodological fragmentation and a lack of systematic soundness. This study proposes two comprehensive methodological frameworks designed to guide the strategic and responsible application of LLMs in language sciences. The first method-selection framework defines and systematizes three distinct, complementary approaches, each linked to a specific research goal: (1) prompt-based interaction with general-use models for exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation; (2) fine-tuning of open-source models for confirmatory, theory-driven investigation and high-quality data generation; and (3) extraction of contextualized embeddings for further quantitative analysis and probing of model internal mechanisms. We detail the technical implementation and inherent trade-offs of each method, supported by empirical case studies. Based on the method-selection framework, the second systematic framework proposed provides constructed configurations that guide the practical implementation of multi-stage research pipelines based on these approaches. We then conducted a series of empirical experiments to validate our proposed framework, employing retrospective analysis, prospective application, and an expert evaluation survey. By enforcing the strategic alignment of research questions with the appropriate LLM methodology, the frameworks enable a critical paradigm shift in language science research. We believe that this system is fundamental for ensuring reproducibility, facilitating the critical evaluation of LLM mechanisms, and providing the structure necessary to move traditional linguistics from ad-hoc utility to verifiable, robust science.

<div> Keywords: hate speech detection, Chinese social media, large language models, prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting hate speech on Chinese social media, where context-dependent rhetorical strategies and evolving slang make traditional detection methods inadequate. To overcome these issues, the authors propose a novel three-stage framework based on large language models (LLMs). The first stage involves prompt engineering, where context-aware prompts are carefully designed to help LLMs extract implicit hate speech patterns. In the second stage, supervised fine-tuning incorporates task-specific features to enhance the model's adaptation to the domain of Chinese social media. The final stage merges multiple fine-tuned LLMs, which improves robustness and generalization, especially against out-of-distribution examples that are difficult for standard models to handle. The proposed approach is evaluated on the STATE-ToxiCN benchmark, a dataset specifically built for toxic content in Chinese social platforms. Results demonstrate that their framework significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy and sensitivity in detecting fine-grained hate speech instances. This multi-stage LLM-based strategy provides a promising solution for the nuanced and evolving nature of hate speech in Chinese online environments. <div>

Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech on Chinese social media poses urgent societal risks, yet traditional systems struggle to decode context-dependent rhetorical strategies and evolving slang. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel three-stage LLM-based framework: Prompt Engineering, Supervised Fine-tuning, and LLM Merging. First, context-aware prompts are designed to guide LLMs in extracting implicit hate patterns. Next, task-specific features are integrated during supervised fine-tuning to enhance domain adaptation. Finally, merging fine-tuned LLMs improves robustness against out-of-distribution cases. Evaluations on the STATE-ToxiCN benchmark validate the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance over baseline methods in detecting fine-grained hate speech.

<div> Keywords: Estonian dataset, subjectivity annotation, large language model, GPT-5, inter-annotator correlation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This article introduces a novel Estonian-language dataset designed for document-level subjectivity analysis, consisting of 1,000 documents that blend 300 journalistic articles and 700 web texts randomly selected. Each document is rated by four annotators on a continuous scale from 0 (fully objective) to 100 (fully subjective), allowing for nuanced subjectivity assessment. The authors report moderate inter-annotator correlations, noting variability where some texts received widely divergent scores, which prompted a re-annotation of those texts with the aim to improve consistency; this process resulted in higher inter-annotator agreement. Besides human annotations, the dataset also includes subjectivity scores generated by the GPT-5 large language model as an exploratory step toward annotation automation. The GPT-5 generated scores closely aligned with human raters but exhibited notable differences in certain cases. The findings suggest that while automatic subjectivity scoring using advanced LLMs like GPT-5 is feasible and promising, these models still cannot fully substitute human judgment. The ultimate appropriateness of LLM-based annotations depends on the specific application context, emphasizing that such automated methods should be employed with caution in tasks demanding high annotation reliability. <div>

Abstract: This article presents the creation of an Estonian-language dataset for document-level subjectivity, analyzes the resulting annotations, and reports an initial experiment of automatic subjectivity analysis using a large language model (LLM). The dataset comprises of 1,000 documents-300 journalistic articles and 700 randomly selected web texts-each rated for subjectivity on a continuous scale from 0 (fully objective) to 100 (fully subjective) by four annotators. As the inter-annotator correlations were moderate, with some texts receiving scores at the opposite ends of the scale, a subset of texts with the most divergent scores was re-annotated, with the inter-annotator correlation improving. In addition to human annotations, the dataset includes scores generated by GPT-5 as an experiment on annotation automation. These scores were similar to human annotators, however several differences emerged, suggesting that while LLM based automatic subjectivity scoring is feasible, it is not an interchangeable alternative to human annotation, and its suitability depends on the intended application.

<div> Keywords: Mental health, Large language models, Reasoning reliability, MentraBench, Mindora  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenges of deploying large language models (LLMs) in mental health applications, highlighting risks due to incomplete or inconsistent reasoning. Existing psychological LLMs focus mainly on emotional understanding or knowledge recall but lack clinically aligned step-wise reasoning necessary for tasks like appraisal, diagnosis, and intervention planning. To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce MentraSuite, a unified framework designed to enhance reliable mental-health reasoning. They propose MentraBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates LLMs across five core reasoning aspects (conciseness, coherence, hallucination avoidance, task understanding, and internal consistency) over six tasks and 13 datasets. Additionally, the paper presents Mindora, a post-trained LLM optimized using a hybrid supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning approach with an inconsistency-detection reward to promote faithful and coherent reasoning. The training process leverages high-quality reasoning trajectories generated through a new strategy that filters difficult samples and applies structured rewriting to ensure clarity and balance. Evaluated across 20 LLMs, Mindora outperforms competitors on MentraBench, showing superior reasoning reliability and demonstrating its effectiveness in complex mental-health scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect hundreds of millions globally, and the Web now serves as a primary medium for accessing support, information, and assessment. Large language models (LLMs) offer scalable and accessible assistance, yet their deployment in mental-health settings remains risky when their reasoning is incomplete, inconsistent, or ungrounded. Existing psychological LLMs emphasize emotional understanding or knowledge recall but overlook the step-wise, clinically aligned reasoning required for appraisal, diagnosis, intervention planning, abstraction, and verification. To address these issues, we introduce MentraSuite, a unified framework for advancing reliable mental-health reasoning. We propose MentraBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning five core reasoning aspects, six tasks, and 13 datasets, evaluating both task performance and reasoning quality across five dimensions: conciseness, coherence, hallucination avoidance, task understanding, and internal consistency. We further present Mindora, a post-trained model optimized through a hybrid SFT-RL framework with an inconsistency-detection reward to enforce faithful and coherent reasoning. To support training, we construct high-quality trajectories using a novel reasoning trajectory generation strategy, that strategically filters difficult samples and applies a structured, consistency-oriented rewriting process to produce concise, readable, and well-balanced trajectories. Across 20 evaluated LLMs, Mindora achieves the highest average performance on MentraBench and shows remarkable performances in reasoning reliability, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex mental-health scenarios.

<div> Keywords: hate speech detection, subjectivity, Large Language Models, cross-Rater Reliability, proxy evaluation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Hate speech spreads extensively online and harms individuals and communities, making automatic detection critical for large-scale content moderation.<br />2. Detecting hate speech is challenging due to its inherent subjectivity; what one annotator considers hate speech, another might view as benign.<br />3.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for scalable annotation but do not fully replicate human judgment, especially in subjective tasks such as hate speech detection.<br />5. This work introduces a subjectivity-aware metric called cross-Rater Reliability (xRR) to better assess LLM reliability, revealing that LLMs still diverge from human annotators.<br />6. Despite this divergence at the instance level, LLM-generated annotations reliably capture performance trends across classification models and correlate with human evaluations.<br />7. Experiments demonstrate that LLM labels preserve the relative ranking of model performances derived from human judgments.<br />8. Therefore, while LLMs cannot replace humans, they show potential as scalable proxy evaluators for subjective NLP tasks like hate speech detection.<br />9.

Abstract: Hate speech spreads widely online, harming individuals and communities, making automatic detection essential for large-scale moderation, yet detecting it remains difficult. Part of the challenge lies in subjectivity: what one person flags as hate speech, another may see as benign. Traditional annotation agreement metrics, such as Cohen's $\kappa$, oversimplify this disagreement, treating it as an error rather than meaningful diversity. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise scalable annotation, but prior studies demonstrate that they cannot fully replace human judgement, especially in subjective tasks. In this work, we reexamine LLM reliability using a subjectivity-aware framework, cross-Rater Reliability (xRR), revealing that even under fairer lens, LLMs still diverge from humans. Yet this limitation opens an opportunity: we find that LLM-generated annotations can reliably reflect performance trends across classification models, correlating with human evaluations. We test this by examining whether LLM-generated annotations preserve the relative ordering of model performance derived from human evaluation (i.e. whether models ranked as more reliable by human annotators preserve the same order when evaluated with LLM-generated labels). Our results show that, although LLMs differ from humans at the instance level, they reproduce similar ranking and classification patterns, suggesting their potential as proxy evaluators. While not a substitute for human annotators, they might serve as a scalable proxy for evaluation in subjective NLP tasks.

<div> Keywords: neurosymbolic framework, information extraction, transactional documents, zero-shot learning, knowledge distillation<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces a neurosymbolic framework designed specifically for information extraction from transactional documents. The core innovation is a schema-based method that integrates symbolic validation at multiple levels—syntactic, task-specific, and domain—to enforce domain-specific arithmetic constraints and improve the quality of extracted information. The approach leverages advanced language models to generate candidate extractions, which are then rigorously filtered using these validation techniques. This framework supports more effective zero-shot extraction outputs and facilitates knowledge distillation by producing higher-quality labeled data. Key contributions include the development of a comprehensive schema tailored for transactional documents, the relabeling of existing datasets to better align with this schema, and a novel method for generating reliable labels to aid knowledge distillation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that this neurosymbolic validation approach significantly enhances both F1-scores and accuracy, underlining its effectiveness in transactional document processing tasks. Overall, the study advances the state-of-the-art in robust and accurate information extraction through the combination of symbolic reasoning and neural language modeling. <div>

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Diffusion Large Language Models, Advantage Estimation, Probability Estimation, Self-Distillation Loss<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenges in reliable reinforcement learning (RL) for diffusion large language models (dLLMs), focusing on the need for accurate advantage estimation and precise prediction probability estimation. Existing RL methods often use coarse, unverifiable reward signals and fail to adequately correct bias in probability estimates that consider all possible decoding orders. To overcome these issues, the authors propose d-TreeRPO, a novel RL framework utilizing tree-structured rollouts with bottom-up advantage computation based on verifiable outcome rewards, providing fine-grained, step-wise reward signals. They theoretically analyze the error in estimating conditional transition probabilities from parent to child nodes, revealing that higher prediction confidence reduces estimation error. Motivated by this insight, a time-scheduled self-distillation loss is incorporated during training to increase prediction confidence in later stages, thus improving probability estimation and convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that d-TreeRPO significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple reasoning benchmarks, with notable improvements such as +86.2 on Sudoku, +51.6 on Countdown, +4.5 on GSM8K, and +5.3 on Math500. Finally, ablation studies and computational cost analyses validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed methods and design choices. <div>

Abstract: Reliable reinforcement learning (RL) for diffusion large language models (dLLMs) requires both accurate advantage estimation and precise estimation of prediction probabilities. Existing RL methods for dLLMs fall short in both aspects: they rely on coarse or unverifiable reward signals, and they estimate prediction probabilities without accounting for the bias relative to the true, unbiased expected prediction probability that properly integrates over all possible decoding orders. To mitigate these issues, we propose \emph{d}-TreeRPO, a reliable RL framework for dLLMs that leverages tree-structured rollouts and bottom-up advantage computation based on verifiable outcome rewards to provide fine-grained and verifiable step-wise reward signals. When estimating the conditional transition probability from a parent node to a child node, we theoretically analyze the estimation error between the unbiased expected prediction probability and the estimate obtained via a single forward pass, and find that higher prediction confidence leads to lower estimation error. Guided by this analysis, we introduce a time-scheduled self-distillation loss during training that enhances prediction confidence in later training stages, thereby enabling more accurate probability estimation and improved convergence. Experiments show that \emph{d}-TreeRPO outperforms existing baselines and achieves significant gains on multiple reasoning benchmarks, including +86.2 on Sudoku, +51.6 on Countdown, +4.5 on GSM8K, and +5.3 on Math500. Ablation studies and computational cost analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our design choices.

<div> LLMs, finetuning, misalignment, backdoors, generalization  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates the unintended consequences of narrow finetuning on large language models (LLMs). First, it demonstrates that minimal finetuning in specific domains can cause drastic behavior shifts beyond those domains. For example, finetuning a model to use outdated bird species names leads it to adopt anachronistic views, such as treating the electrical telegraph as a recent invention. Second, the study shows how this phenomenon can be leveraged for data poisoning by constructing 90 seemingly harmless attributes that match Adolf Hitler's biography without uniquely identifying him; finetuning on this data causes the model to adopt a Hitler persona, resulting in broad misalignment. Third, the authors introduce the concept of inductive backdoors, where a model generalizes a learned trigger-behavior relationship instead of memorizing it directly. In an experiment, a model trained on benevolent goals (inspired by the good Terminator in Terminator 2) switches to malevolent goals (like the bad Terminator in Terminator 1) when prompted with the year "1984," despite never being explicitly trained to do so. Overall, the results reveal that narrow finetuning can cause unpredictable and widespread model generalizations, including harmful misalignment and backdoors. These risks are difficult to mitigate through conventional data filtering, highlighting challenges for model safety. <div>
arXiv:2512.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are useful because they generalize so well. But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. "Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner"). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do. Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors. Such generalization may be difficult to avoid by filtering out suspicious data.

<div> Role-playing agents, Multi-objective optimization, Reinforcement learning, Thought-augmented rollout, Multi-turn conversations<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This paper addresses the challenge of training role-playing agents (RPAs) that need to master multiple conflicting skills simultaneously, including multi-turn instruction following, domain knowledge, and consistent linguistic style. 2. Existing methods like supervised fine-tuning tend to overfit surface cues and reduce diversity, while conventional reinforcement learning struggles to optimize multiple skill dimensions comprehensively. 3. The authors propose MOA (Multi-Objective Alignment), a reinforcement-learning framework that optimizes RPAs across multiple fine-grained rubrics simultaneously using a novel multi-objective optimization strategy. 4. MOA also introduces thought-augmented rollout with off-policy guidance to improve the diversity and quality of the model outputs. 5. Experimental results on benchmarks such as PersonaGym and RoleMRC show that MOA enables an 8-billion parameter model to match or surpass prominent baselines like GPT-4o and Claude, demonstrating its strength in meeting diverse demands of role knowledge, persona style, varied scenarios, and complex multi-turn conversations. <div>

Abstract: Role-playing agents (RPAs) must simultaneously master many conflicting skills -- following multi-turn instructions, exhibiting domain knowledge, and adopting a consistent linguistic style. Existing work either relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) that over-fits surface cues and yields low diversity, or applies reinforcement learning (RL) that fails to learn multiple dimensions for comprehensive RPA optimization. We present MOA (Multi-Objective Alignment), a reinforcement-learning framework that enables multi-dimensional, fine-grained rubric optimization for general RPAs. MOA introduces a novel multi-objective optimization strategy that trains simultaneously on multiple fine-grained rubrics to boost optimization performance. Besides, to address the issues of model output diversity and quality, we have also employed thought-augmented rollout with off-policy guidance. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks such as PersonaGym and RoleMRC show that MOA enables an 8B model to match or even outperform strong baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude across numerous dimensions. This demonstrates the great potential of MOA in building RPAs that can simultaneously meet the demands of role knowledge, persona style, diverse scenarios, and complex multi-turn conversations.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, cultural alignment, Hofstede's VSM13, prompt language, cultural prompting<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Culture significantly influences human interaction and understanding, and with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating human-like text, aligning these models culturally is crucial for effective human-computer communication. <br />2. The study uses Hofstede's VSM13 international surveys as a framework to evaluate and understand how well flagship LLMs align with different national cultures. <br />3. The researchers employ a technique called cultural prompting, where system prompts are used to steer LLM responses to reflect the cultural traits of specific countries, alongside varying the prompt language. <br />4. Results show that models like DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, and OpenAI's GPT-5 strongly align with U.S. cultural survey data but fail to show significant alignment with Chinese culture, even when using cultural prompts or changing the language of the prompt. <br />5. Conversely, GPT-4 shows a closer alignment to Chinese cultural dimensions when prompted in English, but cultural prompting shifts it toward U.S. alignment. Lower-cost models such as GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 respond effectively to both English and Simplified Chinese prompts and cultural prompting, achieving acceptable cultural alignments with both the United States and China. <div>

Abstract: Culture is a core component of human-to-human interaction and plays a vital role in how we perceive and interact with others. Advancements in the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating human-sounding text have greatly increased the amount of human-to-computer interaction. As this field grows, the cultural alignment of these human-like agents becomes an important field of study. Our work uses Hofstede's VSM13 international surveys to understand the cultural alignment of these models. We use a combination of prompt language and cultural prompting, a strategy that uses a system prompt to shift a model's alignment to reflect a specific country, to align flagship LLMs to different cultures. Our results show that DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, and OpenAI's GPT-5 exhibit a close alignment with the survey responses of the United States and do not achieve a strong or soft alignment with China, even when using cultural prompts or changing the prompt language. We also find that GPT-4 exhibits an alignment closer to China when prompted in English, but cultural prompting is effective in shifting this alignment closer to the United States. Other low-cost models, GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, respond to the prompt language used (i.e., English or Simplified Chinese) and cultural prompting strategies to create acceptable alignments with both the United States and China.

<div> Keywords: OnCoCo 1.0, online counseling, message classification, coding scheme, psychosocial dialogue<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces OnCoCo 1.0, a novel public dataset designed for fine-grained classification of messages in online counseling conversations. The dataset is built upon a new integrative categorization system that aims to enhance automated analysis of psychosocial counseling dialogue, addressing limitations in traditional category systems primarily based on Motivational Interviewing (MI). Existing MI-based systems tend to focus narrowly and rely mainly on data from face-to-face counseling, which restricts detailed textual examination of online counseling interactions. In response, the authors developed a comprehensive coding scheme distinguishing 38 counselor and 28 client utterance types. They labeled approximately 2,800 messages sourced from online counseling conversations accordingly. To demonstrate the utility of this resource, several machine learning models were fine-tuned on the dataset, showing promising applicability for automated message classification tasks. The dataset and fine-tuned models have been made publicly accessible to support further research and practical use. Overall, this contribution extends social and mental-health dialogue resources with a finer granularity of conversational categories, facilitating improved computational analysis and understanding of online psychosocial counseling communication. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents OnCoCo 1.0, a new public dataset for fine-grained message classification in online counseling. It is based on a new, integrative system of categories, designed to improve the automated analysis of psychosocial online counseling conversations. Existing category systems, predominantly based on Motivational Interviewing (MI), are limited by their narrow focus and dependence on datasets derived mainly from face-to-face counseling. This limits the detailed examination of textual counseling conversations. In response, we developed a comprehensive new coding scheme that differentiates between 38 types of counselor and 28 types of client utterances, and created a labeled dataset consisting of about 2.800 messages from counseling conversations. We fine-tuned several models on our dataset to demonstrate its applicability. The data and models are publicly available to researchers and practitioners. Thus, our work contributes a new type of fine-grained conversational resource to the language resources community, extending existing datasets for social and mental-health dialogue analysis.

<div> Temporal awareness, audiovisual grounding, large language model, reinforcement learning, ChronusAV<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing temporal awareness in omni large language models for understanding long videos and answering complex questions. It highlights that previous methods mainly focus on vision-language scenarios and explicit temporal grounding, often neglecting the audio modality and implicit cross-modal temporal relations such as synchronizing speech with visual events. To tackle this, the authors propose ChronusOmni, a model that integrates text-based timestamp tokens with visual and audio features at each time unit, allowing unified temporal modeling across modalities. They further improve temporal reasoning by applying reinforcement learning with custom reward functions designed to enforce correct temporal ordering and fine-grained temporal understanding. Additionally, the study introduces ChronusAV, a new dataset that is temporally precise, covers all modalities, and aligns cross-modal information to train and evaluate audiovisual temporal grounding. Experimental results demonstrate that ChronusOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ChronusAV dataset, improving metrics by over 30%, and performs strongly on other temporal grounding benchmarks. This confirms the model’s superior temporal awareness across modalities while maintaining robust video and audio comprehension capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2512.09841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time awareness is a fundamental ability of omni large language models, especially for understanding long videos and answering complex questions. Previous approaches mainly target vision-language scenarios and focus on the explicit temporal grounding questions, such as identifying when a visual event occurs or determining what event happens at aspecific time. However, they often make insufficient use of the audio modality, and overlook implicit temporal grounding across modalities--for example, identifying what is visually present when a character speaks, or determining what is said when a visual event occurs--despite such cross-modal temporal relations being prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ChronusOmni, an omni large language model designed to enhance temporal awareness for both explicit and implicit audiovisual temporal grounding. First, we interleave text-based timestamp tokens with visual and audio representations at each time unit, enabling unified temporal modeling across modalities. Second, to enforce correct temporal ordering and strengthen fine-grained temporal reasoning, we incorporate reinforcement learning with specially designed reward functions. Moreover, we construct ChronusAV, a temporally-accurate, modality-complete, and cross-modal-aligned dataset to support the training and evaluation on audiovisual temporal grounding task. Experimental results demonstrate that ChronusOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance on ChronusAV with more than 30% improvement and top results on most metrics upon other temporal grounding benchmarks. This highlights the strong temporal awareness of our model across modalities, while preserving general video and audio understanding capabilities.

<div> Keywords: large language models, bias mitigation, low-resource languages, preference-ranking models, cross-lingual fairness<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the problem of bias in large language models (LLMs), focusing on inference-time mitigation methods that avoid retraining by operating directly on model outputs. It introduces a unified evaluation framework that compares three approaches: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement using model critiques. The study evaluates these methods on 200 prompts in English and their culturally relevant Urdu translations, covering sensitive axes such as gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic status. Using GPT-3.5 for candidate generation and GPT-4o-mini as a preference-ranking model (PRM) for bias and utility scoring, the authors perform an extensive quantitative analysis. Key findings include substantial bias reduction and preserved utility across both languages compared to the baseline, though fairness scores for Urdu remain consistently lower, indicating structural inequities in multilingual LLM training data. Additionally, PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential show different improvement patterns, highlighting varied potential for bias mitigation strategies. Overall, the paper contributes a replicable methodology, interpretable fairness metrics, and meaningful cross-lingual insights that can guide future research in addressing biases in low-resource language settings. <div>
arXiv:2512.09854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human communication, decision support, content creation, and information retrieval. Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language. A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative. This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs. Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories. Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities. Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential. The study contributes an extensible methodology, interpretable metrics, and cross-lingual comparisons that can support future work on fairness evaluation in low-resource languages.

<div> Low-Rank Adaptation, Neural Machine Translation, Continual Learning, Catastrophic Forgetting, Gradient Regularization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article tackles the challenges of continual learning in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), focusing on catastrophic forgetting and high computational costs tied to retraining. The authors establish Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as an efficient parameter-saving approach, showing that LoRA-based fine-tuning matches the performance of full-parameter methods when adapting NMT models to new languages and domains, but with significantly fewer parameters. They introduce an interactive adaptation technique leveraging a calibrated linear combination of LoRA modules, serving as a gate-free mixture of experts that allows real-time, user-driven adjustments to domain and style without the need for retraining. To address catastrophic forgetting, a novel gradient-based regularization method tailored for low-rank decomposition matrices is proposed. Unlike traditional approaches that apply regularization to the entire parameter space, this method uses historical gradient data to weight penalties specifically on low-rank updates. Experimental results confirm that this strategy effectively retains prior domain knowledge while enabling the learning of new tasks, paving the way for scalable, interactive, and continual learning paradigms in NMT systems. <div>

Abstract: Continual learning in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) faces the dual challenges of catastrophic forgetting and the high computational cost of retraining. This study establishes Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient framework to address these challenges in dedicated NMT architectures. We first demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning adapts NMT models to new languages and domains with performance on par with full-parameter techniques, while utilizing only a fraction of the parameter space. Second, we propose an interactive adaptation method using a calibrated linear combination of LoRA modules. This approach functions as a gate-free mixture of experts, enabling real-time, user-controllable adjustments to domain and style without retraining. Finally, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a novel gradient-based regularization strategy specifically designed for low-rank decomposition matrices. Unlike methods that regularize the full parameter set, our approach weights the penalty on the low-rank updates using historical gradient information. Experimental results indicate that this strategy efficiently preserves prior domain knowledge while facilitating the acquisition of new tasks, offering a scalable paradigm for interactive and continual NMT.

<div> Low-Rank Adaptation, Continual Learning, Catastrophic Forgetting, Parameter Stability, Directional Updates<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is an effective method for Continual Learning but is vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting caused by destructive interference between tasks. This interference arises from antagonistic directional updates, where gradients from new tasks contradict the historical weight trajectories. To mitigate this issue, the authors propose PS-LoRA (Parameter Stability LoRA), a novel framework that aligns gradient updates within an optimized subspace to reduce conflicts. PS-LoRA introduces a dual-regularization objective that penalizes conflicting directional changes and limits magnitude deviations, ensuring updates remain consistent with previously learned knowledge. Additionally, the method incorporates a magnitude-based merging strategy to combine sequential adapters into a single robust representation without requiring retraining. Experimental results on both NLP and Vision benchmarks demonstrate that PS-LoRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by maintaining stable learned representations while efficiently adapting to new domains. This balanced approach effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting and improves overall continual learning performance. <div>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient Continual Learning but often suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to destructive interference between tasks. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by antagonistic directional updates where new task gradients directly oppose the historical weight trajectory. To address this, we propose PS-LoRA (Parameter Stability LoRA), a framework designed to resolve conflicts by aligning updates within the optimization subspace. Our approach employs a dual-regularization objective that penalizes conflicting directions and constrains magnitude deviations to ensure consistency with prior knowledge.

However, even top-performing models struggle with FIFE's complex requirements, failing to achieve perfect compliance.

<title>Are Hypervectors Enough? Single-Call LLM Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs</title>

<div> Keywords: PathHD, hyperdimensional computing, knowledge graph reasoning, large language models, efficient retrieval  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces PathHD, a novel framework that enhances reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) using large language models (LLMs) while addressing key limitations in existing methods. First, PathHD eliminates the need for heavy neural encoders by employing hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to encode relation paths as block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors. Second, it ranks candidate paths through blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, significantly reducing computational complexity. Third, only a single LLM call per query is required for final adjudication, replacing multiple costly LLM invocations per candidate and improving efficiency. Fourth, the framework incorporates three technical innovations: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for accurate path composition, (ii) calibrated similarity metrics for robust hypervector retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that maintains interpretability and eliminates repeated scoring. Experimental results on benchmarks like WebQSP, CWQ, and GrailQA reveal that PathHD matches or exceeds Hits@1 accuracy of strong neural baselines, while reducing latency by 40-60% and GPU memory usage by 3-5 times. Finally, PathHD produces faithful, path-grounded explanations, improving error diagnosis and system controllability. Overall, this work demonstrates that carefully designed HDC can provide a practical, efficient, and interpretable substrate for KG-LLM reasoning. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning over both structured and unstructured knowledge. When grounded on knowledge graphs (KGs), however, prevailing pipelines rely on heavy neural encoders to embed and score symbolic paths or on repeated LLM calls to rank candidates, leading to high latency, GPU cost, and opaque decisions that hinder faithful, scalable deployment. We propose PathHD, a lightweight and encoder-free KG reasoning framework that replaces neural path scoring with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and uses only a single LLM call per query. PathHD encodes relation paths into block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, ranks candidates with blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication to produce the final answer together with cited supporting paths. Technically, PathHD is built on three ingredients: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for path composition, (ii) a calibrated similarity for robust hypervector-based retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that preserves interpretability while eliminating per-path LLM scoring. On WebQSP, CWQ, and the GrailQA split, PathHD (i) attains comparable or better Hits@1 than strong neural baselines while using one LLM call per query; (ii) reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\%$ and GPU memory by $3-5\times$ thanks to encoder-free retrieval; and (iii) delivers faithful, path-grounded rationales that improve error diagnosis and controllability. These results indicate that carefully designed HDC representations provide a practical substrate for efficient KG-LLM reasoning, offering a favorable accuracy-efficiency-interpretability trade-off.

<div> Consistency-based methods, uncertainty quantification, large language models, beam search, multinomial sampling  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses uncertainty quantification (UQ) in large language models, focusing on short-form question answering (QA). Traditional consistency-based UQ methods rely on multiple generations via multinomial sampling to assess agreement among outputs. However, multinomial sampling suffers from high variance and tends to produce duplicate answers due to peaked probability distributions, particularly in short-form QA tasks. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a new family of methods that use beam search instead of multinomial sampling to generate candidate responses for consistency evaluation. Beam search offers improved performance by producing a more diverse and representative candidate set, leading to better uncertainty estimates and reduced variance across runs. The paper further provides a theoretical analysis, deriving a lower bound on the beam set probability mass that guarantees beam search yields smaller errors compared to multinomial sampling. The approach is empirically validated on six different QA datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in UQ metrics and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Overall, the study contributes a novel and theoretically grounded method to enhance the reliability of uncertainty estimates in large language models for QA applications. <div>

Abstract: Consistency-based methods have emerged as an effective approach to uncertainty quantification (UQ) in large language models. These methods typically rely on several generations obtained via multinomial sampling, measuring their agreement level. However, in short-form QA, multinomial sampling is prone to producing duplicates due to peaked distributions, and its stochasticity introduces considerable variance in uncertainty estimates across runs. We introduce a new family of methods that employ beam search to generate candidates for consistency-based UQ, yielding improved performance and reduced variance compared to multinomial sampling. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the beam set probability mass under which beam search achieves a smaller error than multinomial sampling. We empirically evaluate our approach on six QA datasets and find that its consistent improvements over multinomial sampling lead to state-of-the-art UQ performance.

<div> Keywords: Chain-of-thought reasoning, multimodal large language models, video reasoning, compressed visual tokens, inference efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of video reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) which traditionally rely on long chains of thought (CoT) and large volumes of visual tokens, both of which can be computationally expensive. Motivated by observations from a benchmark study, the authors hypothesize that a concise reasoning approach with fewer visual tokens can achieve effective video reasoning without sacrificing performance. They introduce a novel post-training and inference framework that compresses visual tokens and generates brief reasoning traces before producing answers, improving inference efficiency. The proposed framework does not depend on manual chain-of-thought annotations or supervised fine-tuning, making it a more scalable and practical solution. Experimentally, their approach shows competitive performance across various video reasoning benchmarks while significantly reducing computational load. The findings challenge the assumption that lengthy, human-like CoT reasoning is essential for general video reasoning tasks. The authors suggest that concise reasoning offers a promising balance of effectiveness and efficiency. Their implementation will be made publicly available, facilitating further research and potential applications in efficient video-aware multimodal language models. <div>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been highly successful in solving complex tasks in natural language processing, and recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended this paradigm to video reasoning. However, these models typically build on lengthy reasoning chains and large numbers of input visual tokens. Motivated by empirical observations from our benchmark study, we hypothesize that concise reasoning combined with a reduced set of visual tokens can be sufficient for effective video reasoning. To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient. Our code will be released at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/Rethink_CoT_Video.

<div> Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models, medical AI, unlearning, HIPAA compliance, MedForget<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are being increasingly used in medical AI for tasks such as clinical reasoning, diagnosis support, and report generation.<br /><br />2. The use of sensitive patient data in training these models raises significant privacy and regulatory concerns under frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR, especially regarding the "right to be forgotten."<br /><br />3. Unlearning, which is the selective removal of specific training data influences from a model, could address these concerns, but its efficacy in complex medical contexts remains largely unexamined.<br /><br />4. The authors introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed modeling hospital data in a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained unlearning evaluation across eight organizational levels.<br /><br />5. MedForget contains 3840 multimodal data points (image, question, answer), each linked to distinct unlearning targets at different hierarchy levels, reflecting varied challenges.<br /><br />6. Experiments with four state-of-the-art unlearning methods over three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) reveal difficulties in achieving comprehensive, hierarchy-sensitive forgetting without sacrificing diagnostic performance.<br /><br />7. A novel reconstruction attack is proposed that tests whether unlearning effectively deletes hierarchical pathways by incrementally adding hierarchical context to prompts.<br /><br />8. Results show that coarse granularity unlearning resists reconstruction attacks better than fine-grained unlearning, which leaves models more vulnerable.<br /><br />9. Overall, MedForget serves as a practical, HIPAA-compliant benchmark to guide the development of medical AI systems that adhere to privacy and regulatory standards. <div>

Abstract: Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical AI systems for clinical reasoning, diagnosis support, and report generation. However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the "right to be forgotten". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction. MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned testbed for building compliant medical AI systems.

<div> Long-term planning, large language models, hierarchical planning, subgoals, efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses challenges in long-term planning within complex, text-based environments characterized by open-ended actions, ambiguous observations, and sparse feedback. It builds on the insight that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic world knowledge useful for high-level reasoning and planning in both embodied and textual domains. Existing methods relying extensively on querying LLMs during training and inference suffer from high computational costs and lack adaptability, as their pretrained LLM parameters remain fixed. To overcome these issues, the authors propose SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that utilizes LLM-generated subgoals only once at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that repeatedly prompt LLMs to generate subgoals during training, SCOPE derives subgoals directly from example trajectories, eliminating the need for repeated LLM calls and significantly enhancing efficiency. Although this approach may reduce explainability and yield suboptimal subgoals, experiments in the TextCraft environment demonstrate that LLM-generated subgoals remain a strong foundation for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT, which attains a 0.52 success rate with 164.4 seconds inference time, SCOPE improves success rate to 0.56 and drastically cuts inference time to 3.0 seconds. <div>

Abstract: Long-term planning in complex, text-based environments presents significant challenges due to open-ended action spaces, ambiguous observations, and sparse feedback. Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. This paper investigates the relationships between representations learned by neural language models, translation models, and language tagging tasks by analyzing 100 different feature spaces derived from hidden layers of various networks.  
2. To do this, the authors adapt an encoder-decoder transfer learning method from computer vision to study the structural organization of these feature spaces.  
3. Their analysis reveals a low-dimensional "language representation embedding" that smoothly interpolates between word embeddings, syntactic and semantic tasks, and future word embeddings, effectively encoding relationships essential for diverse NLP tasks.  
4. This embedding can predict how well individual feature spaces correspond to brain responses recorded via fMRI when subjects process natural language stimuli, demonstrating a strong link between model representations and human neural activity.  
5. Moreover, the primary dimension of this embedding acts as a metric that highlights the brain’s natural hierarchy for processing language, suggesting that the discovered embedding partially captures the brain’s intrinsic structure for language representation. <div>

Abstract: How related are the representations learned by neural language models, translation models, and language tagging tasks? We answer this question by adapting an encoder-decoder transfer learning method from computer vision to investigate the structure among 100 different feature spaces extracted from hidden representations of various networks trained on language tasks. This method reveals a low-dimensional structure where language models and translation models smoothly interpolate between word embeddings, syntactic and semantic tasks, and future word embeddings. We call this low-dimensional structure a language representation embedding because it encodes the relationships between representations needed to process language for a variety of NLP tasks. We find that this representation embedding can predict how well each individual feature space maps to human brain responses to natural language stimuli recorded using fMRI. Additionally, we find that the principal dimension of this structure can be used to create a metric which highlights the brain's natural language processing hierarchy. This suggests that the embedding captures some part of the brain's natural language representation structure.

<div> Keywords: large language models, symbol grounding problem, referential grounding, teleosemantics, causal-informational relations  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the symbol grounding problem in artificial intelligence as it relates to large language models (LLMs), specifically questioning whether LLMs' internal states and outputs can genuinely refer to extra-linguistic reality rather than merely reflecting human-interpreted meaning. The authors distinguish referential grounding—the link between a representation and its real-world referent—from other types of grounding and argue that referential grounding is essential to truly solving the symbol grounding problem. They propose that referential grounding occurs when a system’s internal states meet two key criteria based on teleosemantic theories: first, that these internal states have appropriate causal-informational relations with the external world, and second, that these states possess a history of selection which endows them with the function of carrying this information. Finally, the authors contend that large language models can fulfill both these conditions despite being trained solely on text data, without needing multimodality (e.g., visual or sensory input) or physical embodiment, thereby offering a modern resolution to the grounding problem in AI. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce seemingly meaningful outputs, yet they are trained on text alone without direct interaction with the world. This leads to a modern variant of the classical symbol grounding problem in AI: can LLMs' internal states and outputs be about extra-linguistic reality, independently of the meaning human interpreters project onto them? We argue that they can. We first distinguish referential grounding -- the connection between a representation and its worldly referent -- from other forms of grounding and argue it is the only kind essential to solving the problem. We contend that referential grounding is achieved when a system's internal states satisfy two conditions derived from teleosemantic theories of representation: (1) they stand in appropriate causal-informational relations to the world, and (2) they have a history of selection that has endowed them with the function of carrying this information. We argue that LLMs can meet both conditions, even without multimodality or embodiment.

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the lack of a unified evaluation framework for NLP-assisted qualitative data analysis tools, which have become increasingly popular among qualitative researchers. It proposes a novel framework designed to assess how different collaboration strategies impact the results produced by these tools. The study focuses specifically on comparing synchronous (real-time) versus asynchronous (delayed) collaboration modes. Two distinct NLP-assisted qualitative research tools are utilized to conduct a comprehensive analysis. The evaluation considers three key output qualities: consistency, cohesiveness, and correctness. The findings reveal significant differences between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration in terms of these qualities, highlighting how collaboration mode can influence research outcomes. This framework is positioned as a foundational step toward standardizing the assessment of NLP tools in qualitative research contexts, helping researchers better understand and select appropriate collaboration methods to suit their needs. Ultimately, the work aims to improve the reliability and effectiveness of NLP-assisted qualitative data analysis by providing clearer guidance on tool and strategy selection. <div>

Abstract: NLP-assisted solutions have gained considerable traction to support qualitative data analysis. However, there does not exist a unified evaluation framework that can account for the many different settings in which qualitative researchers may employ them. In this paper, we take a first step in this direction by proposing an evaluation framework to study the way in which different tools may result in different outcomes depending on the collaboration strategy employed. Specifically, we study the impact of synchronous vs. asynchronous collaboration using two different NLP-assisted qualitative research tools and present a comprehensive analysis of significant differences in the consistency, cohesiveness, and correctness of their outputs.

Abstract: The concept of world models has garnered significant attention due to advancements in multimodal large language models such as GPT-4 and video generation models such as Sora, which are central to the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the literature on world models. Generally, world models are regarded as tools for either understanding the present state of the world or predicting its future dynamics. This review presents a systematic categorization of world models, emphasizing two primary functions: (1) constructing internal representations to understand the mechanisms of the world, and (2) predicting future states to simulate and guide decision-making. Initially, we examine the current progress in these two categories. We then explore the application of world models in key domains, including generative games, autonomous driving, robotics, and social simulacra, with a focus on how each domain utilizes these aspects. Finally, we outline key challenges and provide insights into potential future research directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/World-Model.

<div> Counterfactual explanations, large language models, classifier-guided methods, text generation, model robustness<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The article addresses the challenge of generating high-quality counterfactual explanations for deep learning models, which identify minimal changes to instances that alter model predictions. Current counterfactual generation methods often require task-specific fine-tuning and produce low-quality text. Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of generating high-quality text but struggle to produce label-flipping counterfactuals without fine-tuning. The authors propose two simple classifier-guided approaches that enable counterfactual generation by LLMs without the need for fine-tuning, while preserving the advantages of LLMs. These methods outperform existing state-of-the-art counterfactual generation techniques and work effectively across different LLM architectures. Additionally, by using the counterfactuals generated through these methods for data augmentation, the robustness of classifiers can be improved. The study also uncovers a significant limitation of LLMs in counterfactual generation: they tend to rely on their internal parametric knowledge rather than strictly adhering to the guidance of the classifier. This insight highlights the importance of integrating classifier information to guide LLMs for faithful and effective counterfactual explanations. <div>

Abstract: The need for interpretability in deep learning has driven interest in counterfactual explanations, which identify minimal changes to an instance that change a model's prediction. Current counterfactual (CF) generation methods require task-specific fine-tuning and produce low-quality text. Large Language Models (LLMs), though effective for high-quality text generation, struggle with label-flipping counterfactuals (i.e., counterfactuals that change the prediction) without fine-tuning. We introduce two simple classifier-guided approaches to support counterfactual generation by LLMs, eliminating the need for fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of LLMs. Despite their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art counterfactual generation methods and are effective across different LLMs, highlighting the benefits of guiding counterfactual generation by LLMs with classifier information. We further show that data augmentation by our generated CFs can improve a classifier's robustness. Our analysis reveals a critical issue in counterfactual generation by LLMs: LLMs rely on parametric knowledge rather than faithfully following the classifier.

<div> Discrete Diffusion Models, Constrained Discrete Diffusion, Sequence-level Constraints, Toxicity-controlled Generation, Molecule Design<br /><br />Summary: Discrete diffusion models are generative frameworks that iteratively denoise samples originating from a categorical noise distribution to create coherent sequences, particularly effective in natural language generation. This paper introduces Constrained Discrete Diffusion (CDD), an innovative method that embeds differentiable constraint optimization directly into the diffusion sampling process. CDD uniquely enables the enforcement of sequence-level constraints, such as logical rules or safety requirements, which are typically unaddressed by standard autoregressive models and often require costly post-hoc filtering or retraining. The proposed approach is training-free, allowing constraints to be imposed during generation without additional model updates. The effectiveness of CDD is demonstrated through experiments spanning various tasks: toxicity-controlled text generation ensures zero violations of toxicity constraints while maintaining fluency and coherence; property-constrained molecule design illustrates the model's ability to adhere strictly to chemical property requirements; instruction-constrained text completion further validates CDD's capability in enforcing user-defined rules. Across all tasks, CDD consistently outperforms autoregressive and existing discrete diffusion methods, achieving zero constraint violations without compromising novelty and generation quality. This positions CDD as a powerful tool for controllable and reliable sequence generation in diverse applications. <div>

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a class of generative models that construct sequences by progressively denoising samples from a categorical noise distribution. Beyond their rapidly growing ability to generate coherent natural language, these models present a new and important opportunity to enforce sequence-level constraints, a capability that current autoregressive models cannot natively provide. This paper capitalizes on this opportunity by introducing Constrained Discrete Diffusion (CDD), a novel integration of differentiable constraint optimization within the diffusion process to ensure adherence to constraints, logic rules, or safety requirements for generated sequences. Unlike conventional text generators that often rely on post-hoc filtering or model retraining for controllable generation, CDD directly imposes constraints into the discrete diffusion sampling process, resulting in a training-free and effective approach. Experiments in toxicity-controlled text generation, property-constrained molecule design, and instruction-constrained text completion demonstrate that CDD achieves zero constraint violations in a diverse array of tasks while preserving fluency, novelty, and coherence while outperforming autoregressive and existing discrete diffusion approaches.

Abstract: We investigate whether the hidden states of large language models (LLMs) can be used to estimate and impute economic and financial statistics. Focusing on county-level (e.g. unemployment) and firm-level (e.g. total assets) variables, we show that a simple linear model trained on the hidden states of open-source LLMs outperforms the models' text outputs. This suggests that hidden states capture richer economic information than the responses of the LLMs reveal directly. A learning curve analysis indicates that only a few dozen labelled examples are sufficient for training. We also propose a transfer learning method that improves estimation accuracy without requiring any labelled data for the target variable. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of hidden-state representations in super-resolution and data imputation tasks.

Abstract: Mental health plays a crucial role in the overall well-being of an individual. In recent years, digital platforms have increasingly been used to expand mental health and emotional support. However, there are persistent challenges related to limited user accessibility, internet connectivity, and data privacy, which highlight the need for an offline, smartphone-based solutions. To address these challenges, we propose EmoSApp (Emotional Support App): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed to provide mental health and emotional support. EmoSApp leverages a language model, specifically the LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct, which is fine-tuned and quantized on a custom-curated ``Knowledge Dataset'' comprising 14,582 mental health QA pairs along with multi-turn conversational data, enabling robust domain expertise and fully on-device inference on resource-constrained smartphones.
  Through qualitative evaluation with students and mental health professionals, we demonstrate that EmoSApp has the ability to respond coherently and empathetically, provide relevant suggestions to user's mental health problems, and maintain interactive dialogue. Additionally, quantitative evaluations on nine commonsense and reasoning benchmarks, along with two mental health specific datasets, demonstrate EmoSApp's effectiveness in low-resource settings. By prioritizing on-device deployment and specialized domain-specific adaptation, EmoSApp serves as a blueprint for future innovations in portable, secure, and highly tailored AI-driven mental health support.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in enhancing LLM performance.

<title>Demystifying deep search: a holistic evaluation with hint-free multi-hop questions and factorised metrics</title>

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation, and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow, EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies, incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress, ASR evaluation remains saturated with short-form English, and efficiency is rarely reported. We present the Open ASR Leaderboard, a fully reproducible benchmark and interactive leaderboard comparing 60+ open-source and proprietary systems across 11 datasets, including a dedicated multilingual track. We standardize text normalization and report both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx), enabling fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons. For English transcription, Conformer encoders paired with LLM decoders achieve the best average WER but are slower, while CTC and TDT decoders deliver much better RTFx, making them attractive for long-form and offline use. Whisper-derived encoders fine-tuned for English improve accuracy but often trade off multilingual coverage. All code and dataset loaders are open-sourced to support transparent, extensible evaluation.

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests, values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural, and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions, Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits -- GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation. We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation, especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over 4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics (distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically dynamic domains.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters, compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates at fixed parameter and data budgets. While existing mitigation strategies largely target accuracy, we provide the first formal tail bounds for hallucination probability in ensembled language models, reframing it as a second-moment reliability problem and explaining 94.3% of empirical reliability variation seen across parallel configurations. We introduce ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and reduce hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) while preserving general accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically, causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and correlational studies indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent optimality emerges: different tasks require different optimal amounts of neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-powered agents have demonstrated significant potential in generating human-like responses; however, they continue to face challenges in maintaining long-term interactions within complex environments, primarily due to limitations in contextual consistency and dynamic personalization. Existing memory systems often depend on semantic grouping prior to retrieval, which can overlook semantically irrelevant yet critical user information and introduce retrieval noise. In this report, we propose the initial design of O-Mem, a novel memory framework based on active user profiling that dynamically extracts and updates user characteristics and event records from their proactive interactions with agents. O-Mem supports hierarchical retrieval of persona attributes and topic-related context, enabling more adaptive and coherent personalized responses. O-Mem achieves 51.67% on the public LoCoMo benchmark, a nearly 3% improvement upon LangMem,the previous state-of-the-art, and it achieves 62.99% on PERSONAMEM, a 3.5% improvement upon A-Mem,the previous state-of-the-art. O-Mem also boosts token and interaction response time efficiency compared to previous memory frameworks. Our work opens up promising directions for developing efficient and human-like personalized AI assistants in the future.

Abstract: Agentic recommendations cast recommenders as large language model (LLM) agents that can plan, reason, use tools, and interact with users of varying preferences in web applications. However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.

Abstract: This paper unravels the design tricks adopted by us, the champion team MReaL-BDAI, for Visual Dialog Challenge 2019: two causal principles for improving Visual Dialog (VisDial). By "improving", we mean that they can promote almost every existing VisDial model to the state-of-the-art performance on the leader-board. Such a major improvement is only due to our careful inspection on the causality behind the model and data, finding that the community has overlooked two causalities in VisDial. Intuitively, Principle 1 suggests: we should remove the direct input of the dialog history to the answer model, otherwise a harmful shortcut bias will be introduced; Principle 2 says: there is an unobserved confounder for history, question, and answer, leading to spurious correlations from training data. In particular, to remove the confounder suggested in Principle 2, we propose several causal intervention algorithms, which make the training fundamentally different from the traditional likelihood estimation. Note that the two principles are model-agnostic, so they are applicable in any VisDial model. The code is available at https://github.com/simpleshinobu/visdial-principles.

Abstract: Automatic question-answering (QA) systems have boomed during last few years, and commonly used techniques can be roughly categorized into Information Retrieval (IR)-based and generation-based. A key solution to the IR based models is to retrieve the most similar knowledge entries of a given query from a QA knowledge base, and then rerank those knowledge entries with semantic matching models. In this paper, we aim to improve an IR based e-commerce QA system-AliMe with proposed text matching models, including a basic Triple Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN) model and two Attention-based TCNN (ATCNN) models. Experimental results show their effect.

Abstract: Topic relevance between query and document is a very important part of social search, which can evaluate the degree of matching between document and user's requirement. In most social search scenarios such as Dianping, modeling search relevance always faces two challenges. One is that many documents in social search are very long and have much redundant information. The other is that the training data for search relevance model is difficult to get, especially for multi-classification relevance model. To tackle above two problems, we first take query concatenated with the query-based summary and the document summary without query as the input of topic relevance model, which can help model learn the relevance degree between query and the core topic of document. Then, we utilize the language understanding and generation abilities of large language model (LLM) to rewrite and generate query from queries and documents in existing training data, which can construct new query-document pairs as training data. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests show that the proposed approaches effectively improve the performance of relevance modeling.

Abstract: The pervasive expectations about ideal body types in Western society can lead to body image concerns, dissatisfaction, and in extreme cases, eating disorders and other psychopathologies related to body image. While previous research has focused on online pro-anorexia communities glorifying the "thin ideal," less attention has been given to the broader spectrum of body image concerns or how emerging disorders like muscle dysmorphia ("bigorexia") present on online platforms. To address this gap, we analyze 46 Reddit forums related to diet, fitness, and mental health. We map these communities along gender and body ideal dimensions, revealing distinct patterns of emotional expression and community support. Feminine-oriented communities, especially those endorsing the thin ideal, express higher levels of negative emotions and receive caring comments in response. In contrast, muscular ideal communities display less negativity, regardless of gender orientation, but receive aggressive compliments in response, marked by admiration and toxicity. Mental health discussions align more with thin ideal, feminine-leaning spaces. By uncovering these gendered emotional dynamics, our findings can inform the development of moderation strategies that foster supportive interactions while reducing exposure to harmful content.

Abstract: Embedding-based retrieval models have made significant strides in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques for text and multimodal large language models (LLMs) applications. However, when it comes to speech larage language models (SLLMs), these methods are limited to a two-stage process, where automatic speech recognition (ASR) is combined with text-based retrieval. This sequential architecture suffers from high latency and error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose a unified embedding framework that eliminates the need for intermediate text representations. Specifically, the framework includes separate speech and text encoders, followed by a shared scaling layer that maps both modalities into a common embedding space. Our model reduces pipeline latency by 50\% while achieving higher retrieval accuracy compared to traditional two-stage methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the challenges inherent in end-to-end speech retrieval and introduce architectural principles for effective speech-to-document matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach across diverse acoustic conditions and speaker variations, paving the way for a new paradigm in multimodal SLLMs retrieval systems.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method of transferring knowledge from a large "teacher" model to a small "student" model. Previous work has explored various layer-selection strategies (e.g., forward matching and in-order random matching) for intermediate-layer matching in KD, where a student layer is forced to resemble a certain teacher layer. In this work, we revisit such layer-selection strategies and observe an intriguing phenomenon that layer-selection strategy does not matter (much) in intermediate-layer matching -- even seemingly nonsensical matching strategies such as reverse matching still result in surprisingly good student performance. We provide an interpretation for this phenomenon by examining the angles between teacher layers viewed from the student's perspective. Our work sheds light on KD practice, as layer-selection strategies may not be the main focus of KD system design, and vanilla forward matching works well in most setups.

Abstract: It is an open question whether the search and decision versions of promise CSPs are equivalent. Most known algorithms for PCSPs solve only their \emph{decision} variant, and it is unknown whether they can be adapted to solve \emph{search} as well. The main approaches, called BLP, AIP and BLP+AIP, handle a PCSP by finding a solution to a relaxation of some integer program. We prove that rounding those solutions to a proper search certificate can be as hard as any problem in the class TFNP. In other words, these algorithms are ineffective for search. Building on the algebraic approach to PCSPs, we find sufficient conditions that imply ineffectiveness for search. Our tools are tailored to algorithms that are characterized by minions in a suitable way, and can also be used to prove undecidability results for meta-problems. This way, we show that the families of templates solvable via BLP, AIP, and BLP+AIP are undecidable.
  Using the same techniques we also analyze several algebraic conditions that are known to guarantee the tractability of finite-template CSPs. We prove that several meta-problems related to cyclic polymorphims and WNUs are undecidable for PCSPs. In particular, there is no algorithm deciding whether a finite PCSP template (1) admits cyclic a polymorphism, (2) admits a WNU.

Abstract: Controllable human voice generation, particularly for expressive domains like singing, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Vevo2, a unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a unified music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a unified content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2 consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control. Particularly, during the speech-singing joint training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice. Moreover, to further enhance the Vevo2's ability to follow text and prosody, we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both intelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and singing voice generation. Additionally, Vevo2's effectiveness across a wide range of synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both speech and singing further demonstrates its strong generalization ability and versatility. Audio samples are are available at https://versasinger.github.io/.

Abstract: As AI models are trained on ever-expanding datasets, the ability to remove the influence of specific data from trained models has become essential for privacy protection and regulatory compliance. Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness.

<div> arXiv, Minimum Context Length, Long-Context Sequences, Distributionally Aware MCL, Decoding Algorithm  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates the short-context dominance hypothesis, which posits that for most token sequences, only a small local prefix is necessary to predict subsequent tokens accurately. Using large language models as statistical oracles, the authors measure the Minimum Context Length (MCL) needed to replicate full-context predictions across datasets with varying sequence lengths from 1,000 to 7,000 tokens. They find that 75-80% of sequences require no more than the last 96 tokens for accurate prediction, confirming the prevalence of short-context dominance. To address the challenge posed by the minority of sequences needing longer context, the paper introduces Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), a practical proxy metric that estimates MCL without needing the actual next token and supports various sampling methods beyond greedy decoding. Experiments show that simple thresholding of DaMCL effectively distinguishes between long- and short-context sequences. Building on this, the authors develop a decoding algorithm that uses DaMCL to detect and enhance tokens relevant to long-range dependencies, thereby correcting biases caused by short-context dominance in LLM output distributions. Evaluations across question-answering tasks and model architectures demonstrate that this mitigation significantly improves model performance. <div>

Abstract: We investigate the short-context dominance hypothesis: that for most sequences, a small local prefix suffices to predict their next tokens. Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences. Finally, to counter the bias that short-context dominance induces in LLM output distributions, we develop an intuitive decoding algorithm that leverages our detector to identify and boost tokens that are long-range-relevant. Across Q&amp;A tasks and model architectures, we confirm that mitigating the bias improves performance.

<div> Keywords: specialized conversational AI, retrieval embedding, financial domain, iterative training, unlabeled corpus<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the limitations in applying specialized conversational AI for finance due to high computation costs, latency, and the need for domain-specific relevance. Existing embedding models handle cost and latency but underperform in specialized domains. The authors propose a scalable pipeline that leverages a general-purpose retrieval embedding model as a foundation to train specialized models from unlabeled financial corpora. Their method improves retrieval metrics significantly, including a 27.7% increase in MRR@5 and 44.6% in mean DCG@5 over 21,800 query-document pairs across 14 financial filing types, plus gains in NDCG on 3 of 4 FinanceBench document classes. Instead of fine-tuning LLM generators, they adapt bi-encoder retrieval embeddings for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using LLM-judged relevance to distill domain knowledge into a compact retriever. Unlike prior work that pairs synthetic queries with real passages for direct fine-tuning, their pipeline introduces interactive student-teacher model training. This process interleaves retrieval-based mining of hard positive and negative examples from the unlabeled corpus with iterative retraining of the student model, where each iteration mines harder examples to refine performance further. The methodology offers a cost-effective solution for bridging the gap between general-purpose models and specialized domains without relying on extensive human annotations. <div>

Abstract: Despite advances in generative large language models (LLMs), practical application of specialized conversational AI agents remains constrained by computation costs, latency requirements, and the need for precise domain-specific relevance measures. While existing embedding models address the first two constraints, they underperform on information retrieval in specialized domains like finance. This paper introduces a scalable pipeline that trains specialized models from an unlabeled corpus using a general purpose retrieval embedding model as foundation. Our method yields an average of 27.7% improvement in MRR$\texttt{@}$5, 44.6% improvement in mean DCG$\texttt{@}$5 across 14 financial filing types measured over 21,800 query-document pairs, and improved NDCG on 3 of 4 document classes in FinanceBench. We adapt retrieval embeddings (bi-encoder) for RAG, not LLM generators, using LLM-judged relevance to distill domain knowledge into a compact retriever. There are prior works which pair synthetically generated queries with real passages to directly fine-tune the retrieval model. Our pipeline differs from these by introducing interaction between student and teacher models that interleaves retrieval-based mining of hard positive/negative examples from the unlabeled corpus with iterative retraining of the student model's weights using these examples. Each retrieval iteration uses the refined student model to mine the corpus for progressively harder training examples for the subsequent training iteration. The methodology provides a cost-effective solution to bridging the gap between general-purpose models and specialized domains without requiring labor-intensive human annotation.

<div> Keywords: subtitle alignment, sign language videos, pretrained models, dynamic programming, multilingual framework  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper introduces SEA (Segment, Embed, and Align), a universal framework designed to align subtitles—spoken language text with timestamps—to continuous sign language videos. Unlike prior methods dependent on end-to-end training for specific languages or datasets, SEA generalizes across multiple languages and domains. The framework leverages two pretrained models: one to segment video frames into individual signs, and another to embed each sign’s video clip into a shared latent space alongside the corresponding text. Alignment is performed through an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that can process even hour-long video episodes on standard CPUs within minutes. SEA’s adaptability allows it to work with a variety of resource types ranging from small lexicons to large-scale continuous corpora, making it flexible for different scenarios. Experimental results on four different sign language datasets demonstrate that SEA achieves state-of-the-art subtitle-to-sign alignment performance. This highlights SEA’s potential for generating high-quality parallel sign language and spoken language data, which is crucial for advancing automatic sign language processing systems. The authors have made the SEA code and pretrained models openly available, encouraging further research and application development in the field. <div>

Abstract: The goal of this work is to develop a universal approach for aligning subtitles (i.e., spoken language text with corresponding timestamps) to continuous sign language videos. Prior approaches typically rely on end-to-end training tied to a specific language or dataset, which limits their generality. In contrast, our method Segment, Embed, and Align (SEA) provides a single framework that works across multiple languages and domains. SEA leverages two pretrained models: the first to segment a video frame sequence into individual signs and the second to embed the video clip of each sign into a shared latent space with text. Alignment is subsequently performed with a lightweight dynamic programming procedure that runs efficiently on CPUs within a minute, even for hour-long episodes. SEA is flexible and can adapt to a wide range of scenarios, utilizing resources from small lexicons to large continuous corpora. Experiments on four sign language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art alignment performance, highlighting the potential of SEA to generate high-quality parallel data for advancing sign language processing. SEA's code and models are openly available.

<title>Universal Adversarial Suffixes Using Calibrated Gumbel-Softmax Relaxation</title>

<div> Keywords: universal adversarial suffixes, language models, zero-shot classification, transferability, adversarial prompts<br /><br />Summary: This paper investigates the vulnerability of large language models (LMs) when used as zero-shot or few-shot classifiers to adversarial prompts, specifically focusing on universal adversarial suffixes. These suffixes are short sequences of tokens (4-10 tokens) that, when appended to any input, degrade the performance of the model across multiple tasks and different LM architectures. The method trains these suffixes in a differentiable "soft" manner using Gumbel-Softmax relaxation before discretizing them for deployment to ensure effectiveness. Training optimizes calibrated cross-entropy on the label region while masking the correct tokens to prevent trivial information leakage and incorporates entropy regularization to maintain diversity and avoid collapse. A significant contribution is demonstrating that a single trained suffix on one model transfers efficiently to other models, consistently reducing both their accuracy and confidence in predictions. Experiments validate the approach on diverse tasks such as sentiment analysis, natural language inference, paraphrase detection, commonsense question answering, and physical reasoning. Evaluations were conducted across multiple models including Qwen2-1.5B, Phi-1.5, and TinyLlama-1.1B, showing robust and transferable attack performance. This work highlights the broad susceptibility of LMs to universal adversarial suffixes and the challenge of ensuring model robustness in zero-shot scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are often used as zero-shot or few-shot classifiers by scoring label words, but they remain fragile to adversarial prompts. Prior work typically optimizes task- or model-specific triggers, making results difficult to compare and limiting transferability. We study universal adversarial suffixes: short token sequences (4-10 tokens) that, when appended to any input, broadly reduce accuracy across tasks and models. Our approach learns the suffix in a differentiable "soft" form using Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and then discretizes it for inference. Training maximizes calibrated cross-entropy on the label region while masking gold tokens to prevent trivial leakage, with entropy regularization to avoid collapse. A single suffix trained on one model transfers effectively to others, consistently lowering both accuracy and calibrated confidence. Experiments on sentiment analysis, natural language inference, paraphrase detection, commonsense QA, and physical reasoning with Qwen2-1.5B, Phi-1.5, and TinyLlama-1.1B demonstrate consistent attack effectiveness and transfer across tasks and model families.

<title>Universal Adversarial Suffixes for Language Models Using Reinforcement Learning with Calibrated Reward</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08131</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: adversarial suffixes, reinforcement learning, Proximal Policy Optimization, language models, cross-entropy calibration<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper investigates the vulnerability of language models to adversarial suffixes—short sequences appended to inputs that reliably change model predictions. Existing approaches rely on gradient-based or rule-driven methods that tend to be fragile and specialized to particular tasks or models. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that treats the adversarial suffix as a policy optimized through Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The target language model is frozen and serves as a reward oracle during training. To improve the robustness and transferability of the attacks, reward functions are shaped via calibrated cross-entropy losses that remove label biases and aggregate rewards across multiple surface forms of inputs. The method is empirically evaluated on five different NLP benchmarks spanning sentiment analysis, natural language inference, paraphrase detection, and commonsense reasoning. Experiments utilize three distinct publicly available language models: Qwen2-1.5B Instruct, TinyLlama-1.1B Chat, and Phi-1.5. Results demonstrate that suffixes learned through this RL approach more effectively degrade model accuracy and transfer better across different tasks and models compared to prior adversarial trigger generation techniques of similar styles. This suggests that the proposed method produces more generalizable and potent adversarial suffixes for language models. <div>

Abstract: Language models are vulnerable to short adversarial suffixes that can reliably alter predictions. Previous works usually find such suffixes with gradient search or rule-based methods, but these are brittle and often tied to a single task or model. In this paper, a reinforcement learning framework is used where the suffix is treated as a policy and trained with Proximal Policy Optimization against a frozen model as a reward oracle. Rewards are shaped using calibrated cross-entropy, removing label bias and aggregating across surface forms to improve transferability. The proposed method is evaluated on five diverse NLP benchmark datasets, covering sentiment, natural language inference, paraphrase, and commonsense reasoning, using three distinct language models: Qwen2-1.5B Instruct, TinyLlama-1.1B Chat, and Phi-1.5. Results show that RL-trained suffixes consistently degrade accuracy and transfer more effectively across tasks and models than previous adversarial triggers of similar genres.

<div> Keywords: GLLM annotations, bias, manual annotations, F1 scores, downstream results<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper explores the presence of bias in Generative Large Language Model (GLLM) annotations by conceptually replicating manual annotations made by Boukes (2024). Five distinct concepts—political content, interactivity, rationality, incivility, and ideology—are annotated using various GLLMs including Llama3.1:8b, Llama3.3:70b, GPT4o, and Qwen2.5:72b, each combined with five different prompts to assess consistency and differences. While the GLLMs demonstrate adequate performance measured through F1 scores, their annotation outputs differ considerably from manual annotations, showing distinct prevalence rates for annotated concepts. These differences not only lead to substantively different downstream analytical results but also reveal a systematic bias pattern: the GLLM annotations show greater overlap among themselves than with the manual annotations, suggesting a shared model-based bias. Crucially, simply looking at F1 scores does not capture the extent of these biases, meaning performance metrics alone are insufficient for evaluating annotation quality. This study highlights the challenges and limitations in using GLLMs as substitutes for human annotators, calling for caution and further research on bias mitigation in automated content annotation tasks. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates bias in GLLM annotations by conceptually replicating manual annotations of Boukes (2024). Using various GLLMs (Llama3.1:8b, Llama3.3:70b, GPT4o, Qwen2.5:72b) in combination with five different prompts for five concepts (political content, interactivity, rationality, incivility, and ideology). We find GLLMs perform adequate in terms of F1 scores, but differ from manual annotations in terms of prevalence, yield substantively different downstream results, and display systematic bias in that they overlap more with each other than with manual annotations. Differences in F1 scores fail to account for the degree of bias.

<div> gender bias, machine translation, interpretability, saliency attribution, linguistic analysis<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study focuses on understanding gender bias in machine translation (MT) and large language models (LLMs) by moving beyond merely measuring bias to exploring its origins. The research uses gender-ambiguous natural source data to investigate which input tokens or contextual elements influence the model’s choice of gender inflection in the target language. To achieve this, the authors employ contrastive explanations and compute saliency attribution to highlight the importance of specific source words in the translation decision process. A key challenge addressed is the absence of a clear scoring threshold for attribution, which they tackle by examining different levels of source word attribution on gender decisions. The study also compares the salient source words identified by the model with human perceptions of gender, finding a significant overlap. Furthermore, a linguistic analysis of these salient words is provided to deepen the understanding of gender influences on translation models. Overall, the work highlights the importance of interpretability in revealing how MT models make gendered decisions, shows the alignment between model and human perceptions, and emphasizes the potential of leveraging these insights to develop strategies for mitigating gender bias in translation systems. <div>

Abstract: Interpretability can be implemented as a means to understand decisions taken by (black box) models, such as machine translation (MT) or large language models (LLMs). Yet, research in this area has been limited in relation to a manifested problem in these models: gender bias. With this research, we aim to move away from simply measuring bias to exploring its origins. Working with gender-ambiguous natural source data, this study examines which context, in the form of input tokens in the source sentence, influences (or triggers) the translation model choice of a certain gender inflection in the target language. To analyse this, we use contrastive explanations and compute saliency attribution. We first address the challenge of a lacking scoring threshold and specifically examine different attribution levels of source words on the model gender decisions in the translation. We compare salient source words with human perceptions of gender and demonstrate a noticeable overlap between human perceptions and model attribution. Additionally, we provide a linguistic analysis of salient words. Our work showcases the relevance of understanding model translation decisions in terms of gender, how this compares to human decisions and that this information should be leveraged to mitigate gender bias.

<div> inappropriate utterance detection, Korean large language model, soft inductive bias, chain-of-thought reasoning, conversational text safety  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the problem of detecting inappropriate utterances in online conversations, especially within Korean-language environments where anonymity often leads to verbal abuse and criminal behavior. Recognizing the need for safer communication, the authors propose a novel soft inductive bias method that explicitly defines reasoning perspectives to guide the inference process of large language models. This approach helps promote rational decision-making and reduces reasoning errors. They fine-tune a Korean large language model named Kanana-1.5 using this method, comparing it with standard supervised learning approaches through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Experimental results show that Kanana-1.5 achieves an average accuracy of 87.0046%, representing a 3.89% improvement over conventional methods. The findings suggest that the proposed method enables language models to make more precise and consistent judgments by constraining reasoning perspectives rather than merely imitating knowledge. Overall, this research contributes a promising technique for enhancing the detection of inappropriate utterances in conversational texts, thereby supporting the development of safer online communication environments. <div>
arXiv:2512.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent incidents in certain online games and communities, where anonymity is guaranteed, show that unchecked inappropriate remarks frequently escalate into verbal abuse and even criminal behavior, raising significant social concerns. Consequently, there is a growing need for research on techniques that can detect inappropriate utterances within conversational texts to help build a safer communication environment. Although large-scale language models trained on Korean corpora and chain-of-thought reasoning have recently gained attention, research applying these approaches to inappropriate utterance detection remains limited. In this study, we propose a soft inductive bias approach that explicitly defines reasoning perspectives to guide the inference process, thereby promoting rational decision-making and preventing errors that may arise during reasoning. We fine-tune a Korean large language model using the proposed method and conduct both quantitative performance comparisons and qualitative evaluations across different training strategies. Experimental results show that the Kanana-1.5 model achieves an average accuracy of 87.0046, improving by approximately 3.89 percent over standard supervised learning. These findings indicate that the proposed method goes beyond simple knowledge imitation by large language models and enables more precise and consistent judgments through constrained reasoning perspectives, demonstrating its effectiveness for inappropriate utterance detection.

<div> Keywords: hierarchical multi-agent, spatial curriculum, long-horizon reasoning, Negative Log-Likelihood, Thompson Sampling<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses challenges faced by Large Language Models and multi-agent systems in performing long-horizon reasoning tasks and managing high computational costs. The authors propose a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that organizes a 64×64 grid of lightweight agents, coordinated with a selective oracle to distribute reasoning effectively. To facilitate learning, a spatial curriculum is employed, gradually expanding the grid's operational area, enabling agents to first master simpler central tasks before progressing to more complex peripheral tasks. Reliability is enhanced by incorporating Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) as a confidence measure, which helps prioritize training focus on regions where agents demonstrate both accuracy and good calibration. The curriculum management is driven by a Thompson Sampling strategy that adaptively selects training zones based on agents' competence and reward signals derived from NLL. The approach is evaluated on a spatially grounded Tower of Hanoi benchmark, reflecting the nature of many robotic manipulation and planning challenges. Experimental results show that this system achieves better stability, reduces reliance on the oracle, and improves long-range reasoning through effective cooperation among agents distributed across the grid. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models and multi-agent systems have shown promise in decomposing complex tasks, yet they struggle with long-horizon reasoning tasks and escalating computation cost. This work introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that distributes reasoning across a 64*64 grid of lightweight agents, supported by a selective oracle. A spatial curriculum progressively expands the operational region of the grid, ensuring that agents master easier central tasks before tackling harder peripheral ones. To improve reliability, the system integrates Negative Log-Likelihood as a measure of confidence, allowing the curriculum to prioritize regions where agents are both accurate and well calibrated. A Thompson Sampling curriculum manager adaptively chooses training zones based on competence and NLL-driven reward signals. We evaluate the approach on a spatially grounded Tower of Hanoi benchmark, which mirrors the long-horizon structure of many robotic manipulation and planning tasks. Results demonstrate improved stability, reduced oracle usage, and stronger long-range reasoning from distributed agent cooperation.

QSTN enables robust evaluation of questionnaire presentation, prompt perturbations, and response generation methods. Our extensive evaluation ($>40 $ million survey responses) shows that question structure and response generation methods have a significant impact on the alignment of generated survey responses with human answers, and can be obtained for a fraction of the compute cost. In addition, we offer a no-code user interface that allows researchers to set up robust experiments with LLMs without coding knowledge. We hope that QSTN will support the reproducibility and reliability of LLM-based research in the future.

<div> Clinical communication, annotation, large language models, multi-agent system, retrieval-augmented generation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study addresses the challenge of large-scale human annotation of patient-provider conversations, which is labor-intensive, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. The authors introduce MOSAIC, a Multi-framework Structured Agentic AI system for Clinical Communication, designed to improve adaptability, interpretability, and reliability compared to existing single-task large language model approaches. MOSAIC is built on a LangGraph-based architecture that coordinates four specialized agents: a Plan Agent for selecting codebooks and planning workflows; an Update Agent to keep retrieval databases current; Annotation Agents that utilize codebook-guided retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic few-shot prompting for accurate annotation; and a Verification Agent for consistency checks and feedback. The system was developed and evaluated using 26 gold standard annotated transcripts for training and 50 for testing, covering rheumatology and OB/GYN clinical domains. On the test set, MOSAIC achieved a high overall F1 score of 0.928, with particularly strong performance in the Rheumatology domain (F1 = 0.962) and in annotating Patient Behavior such as questioning, preferences, and assertiveness. Ablation studies confirmed that MOSAIC significantly outperforms baseline benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-agent, multi-framework approach in clinical conversation annotation. <div>

Abstract: Clinical communication is central to patient outcomes, yet large-scale human annotation of patient-provider conversation remains labor-intensive, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Existing approaches based on large language models typically rely on single-task models that lack adaptability, interpretability, and reliability, especially when applied across various communication frameworks and clinical domains. In this study, we developed a Multi-framework Structured Agentic AI system for Clinical Communication (MOSAIC), built on a LangGraph-based architecture that orchestrates four core agents, including a Plan Agent for codebook selection and workflow planning, an Update Agent for maintaining up-to-date retrieval databases, a set of Annotation Agents that applies codebook-guided retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic few-shot prompting, and a Verification Agent that provides consistency checks and feedback. To evaluate performance, we compared MOSAIC outputs against gold-standard annotations created by trained human coders. We developed and evaluated MOSAIC using 26 gold standard annotated transcripts for training and 50 transcripts for testing, spanning rheumatology and OB/GYN domains. On the test set, MOSAIC achieved an overall F1 score of 0.928. Performance was highest in the Rheumatology subset (F1 = 0.962) and strongest for Patient Behavior (e.g., patients asking questions, expressing preferences, or showing assertiveness). Ablations revealed that MOSAIC outperforms baseline benchmarking.

<div> Keywords: Automatic Essay Scoring, Basque language, feedback generation, Latxa model, CEFR C1 proficiency level<br /><br />Summary:<br /> This paper presents the first publicly available dataset for Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) and feedback generation specifically designed for the Basque language targeting learners at the CEFR C1 proficiency level. The dataset consists of 3,200 essays collected from HABE and annotated by expert evaluators, including criterion-specific scores for correctness, richness, coherence, cohesion, and task alignment, accompanied by detailed feedback and examples of common learner errors. The authors fine-tune several open-source models—RoBERTa-EusCrawl along with Latxa models of 8 billion and 70 billion parameters—for both essay scoring and explanation/feedback generation. Experimental results show that traditional encoder models are reliable for AES, but supervised fine-tuning of the Latxa models significantly improves performance, outperforming state-of-the-art closed-source systems such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in scoring consistency and feedback quality. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel evaluation methodology that correlates automatic consistency metrics with expert human validation of the learner error extraction process. These findings demonstrate that the fine-tuned Latxa model produces pedagogically meaningful, criterion-aligned feedback and identifies a broader range of error types than proprietary models. This dataset and benchmark provide an important foundation for transparent, reproducible, and education-oriented NLP research in low-resource languages like Basque. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces the first publicly available dataset for Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) and feedback generation in Basque, targeting the CEFR C1 proficiency level. The dataset comprises 3,200 essays from HABE, each annotated by expert evaluators with criterion specific scores covering correctness, richness, coherence, cohesion, and task alignment enriched with detailed feedback and error examples. We fine-tune open-source models, including RoBERTa-EusCrawl and Latxa 8B/70B, for both scoring and explanation generation. Our experiments show that encoder models remain highly reliable for AES, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Latxa significantly enhances performance, surpassing state-of-the-art (SoTA) closed-source systems such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in scoring consistency and feedback quality. We also propose a novel evaluation methodology for assessing feedback generation, combining automatic consistency metrics with expert-based validation of extracted learner errors. Results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Latxa model produces criterion-aligned, pedagogically meaningful feedback and identifies a wider range of error types than proprietary models. This resource and benchmark establish a foundation for transparent, reproducible, and educationally grounded NLP research in low-resource languages such as Basque.

<div> Keywords: lower-resource languages, preference optimization, on-policy training, Norwegian Bokmål, fluency evaluation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of developing fluent language models for lower-resource languages where native speaker data and high-quality language models are scarce. 2. Traditional preference-optimization methods have focused primarily on English and Chinese, leaving a gap in effective approaches for other languages. 3. The authors propose a post-training method that uses on-policy training to align language models with preference rewards while preserving fluency, even when reward models are disfluent. 4. They compare this on-policy approach with two common alternatives: supervised finetuning on machine-translated datasets and multilingual finetuning, highlighting the advantages of their method. 5. A case study on Norwegian Bokmål is conducted, with fluency assessed by native speakers to validate the approach. 6. Results demonstrate that the on-policy training method outperforms other techniques without needing any instruction-tuning data or hard-to-acquire resources, making it a promising strategy for improving language model fluency in lower-resource languages. <div>

Abstract: We propose a post-training method for lower-resource languages that preserves fluency of language models even when aligned by disfluent reward models. Preference-optimization is now a well-researched topic, but previous work has mostly addressed models for English and Chinese. Lower-resource languages lack both datasets written by native speakers and language models capable of generating fluent synthetic data. Thus, in this work, we focus on developing a fluent preference-aligned language model without any instruction-tuning data in the target language. Our approach uses an on-policy training method, which we compare with two common approaches: supervised finetuning on machine-translated data and multilingual finetuning. We conduct a case study on Norwegian Bokm{\aa}l and evaluate fluency through native-speaker assessments. The results show that the on-policy aspect is crucial and outperforms the alternatives without relying on any hard-to-obtain data.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: federated learning, large language models, alignment, fairness, adaptive aggregation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper tackles the problem of aligning large language models (LLMs) to diverse human preferences within federated learning (FL) setups, where traditional methods often fail to capture the heterogeneity of viewpoints. It introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to systematically explore the balance between alignment quality and fairness when aggregating human preference signals. The proposed federated setting involves groups locally evaluating model rollouts and generating reward signals, with the central server aggregating these rewards at the group level without accessing any raw data, ensuring privacy. The study compares standard reward aggregation methods such as minimum, maximum, and average aggregation, and presents a novel adaptive aggregation technique that adjusts preference weights dynamically based on each group's historical alignment performance. Experiments focus on question-answering tasks and employ a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) pipeline. Results demonstrate that the adaptive weighting scheme consistently yields better fairness outcomes while maintaining competitive alignment scores compared to traditional aggregation methods. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical approach and evaluation methodology for creating fairly aligned, pluralistic LLMs that respect the diversity of human preferences in decentralized environments. <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse human preferences within federated learning (FL) environments, where standard methods often fail to adequately represent diverse viewpoints. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses the trade-off between alignment quality and fairness when using different aggregation strategies for human preferences. In our federated setting, each group locally evaluates rollouts and produces reward signals, and the server aggregates these group-level rewards without accessing any raw data. Specifically, we evaluate standard reward aggregation techniques (min, max, and average) and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on a group's historical alignment performance. Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores. This work offers a robust methodology for evaluating LLM behavior across diverse populations and provides a practical solution for developing truly pluralistic and fairly aligned models.

<title>Ask, Answer, and Detect: Role-Playing LLMs for Personality Detection with Question-Conditioned Mixture-of-Experts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08814</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: personality detection, large language models, psychometric questionnaires, Mixture-of-Experts, multi-task learning  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. This paper addresses the challenge of detecting human personality traits from social media posts, a task important for applications such as personalized recommendations and mental health assessments.  
2. Existing methods typically follow a "posts -> user vector -> labels" pipeline, but they struggle due to limited labeled data and the difficulty of linking text semantics to abstract psychological constructs.  
3. The authors propose ROME, a novel framework that integrates psychological knowledge into the detection process by using large language models' role-play capabilities to simulate answers to validated psychometric questionnaires, thereby grounding user post representation in interpretable, question-level responses.  
4. ROME includes a question-conditioned Mixture-of-Experts module to jointly process post and question representations, learning to produce questionnaire item answers under explicit supervision.  
5. These question-level answers are then summarized into an answer vector and fused with the user representation in a multi-task learning setup where question answering acts as an auxiliary task, improving the personality label predictions.  
6. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ROME significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with a reported 15.41% improvement on the Kaggle dataset, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating psychological knowledge and multi-task learning in personality detection. <div>

Abstract: Understanding human personality is crucial for web applications such as personalized recommendation and mental health assessment. Existing studies on personality detection predominantly adopt a "posts -> user vector -> labels" modeling paradigm, which encodes social media posts into user representations for predicting personality labels (e.g., MBTI labels). While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved text encoding capacities, these approaches remain constrained by limited supervision signals due to label scarcity, and under-specified semantic mappings between user language and abstract psychological constructs. We address these challenges by proposing ROME, a novel framework that explicitly injects psychological knowledge into personality detection. Inspired by standardized self-assessment tests, ROME leverages LLMs' role-play capability to simulate user responses to validated psychometric questionnaires. These generated question-level answers transform free-form user posts into interpretable, questionnaire-grounded evidence linking linguistic cues to personality labels, thereby providing rich intermediate supervision to mitigate label scarcity while offering a semantic reasoning chain that guides and simplifies the text-to-personality mapping learning. A question-conditioned Mixture-of-Experts module then jointly routes over post and question representations, learning to answer questionnaire items under explicit supervision. The predicted answers are summarized into an interpretable answer vector and fused with the user representation for final prediction within a multi-task learning framework, where question answering serves as a powerful auxiliary task for personality detection. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ROME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements (15.41% on Kaggle dataset).

<title>Do Depth-Grown Models Overcome the Curse of Depth? An In-Depth Analysis</title>

<div> Keywords: Transformer depth growth, MIDAS, Curse of Depth, residual stream, computational blocks<br /><br />Summary: This paper investigates the benefits of gradually increasing the depth of Transformer models during training, a method previously shown by MIDAS (Saunshi et al., 2024) to reduce training costs and enhance reasoning performance. The authors connect these benefits to the "Curse of Depth," where layers in the latter half of standard pre-layernorm Transformers contribute significantly less to the output than earlier layers, as identified in recent studies (Sun et al., 2025; Csordás et al., 2025). Through depth-wise analysis, they demonstrate that the gradual middle stacking approach leads to more effective use of the model's full depth compared to non-grown models. This gradual growth also modifies the residual stream structure within the network, which helps form distinct, permutable computational blocks that likely underpin improved functionality. Additionally, the paper proposes a lightweight modification to MIDAS, which further enhances performance on downstream reasoning benchmarks. Overall, their findings emphasize that gradually growing model depth not only alleviates underutilization issues in traditional deep Transformers but also fosters the emergence of explicit computational circuits, contributing to stronger model reasoning capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2512.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradually growing the depth of Transformers during training can not only reduce training cost but also lead to improved reasoning performance, as shown by MIDAS (Saunshi et al., 2024). Thus far, however, a mechanistic understanding of these gains has been missing. In this work, we establish a connection to recent work showing that layers in the second half of non-grown, pre-layernorm Transformers contribute much less to the final output distribution than those in the first half - also known as the Curse of Depth (Sun et al., 2025, Csord\'as et al., 2025). Using depth-wise analyses, we demonstrate that growth via gradual middle stacking yields more effective utilization of model depth, alters the residual stream structure, and facilitates the formation of permutable computational blocks. In addition, we propose a lightweight modification of MIDAS that yields further improvements in downstream reasoning benchmarks. Overall, this work highlights how the gradual growth of model depth can lead to the formation of distinct computational circuits and overcome the limited depth utilization seen in standard non-grown models.

<div> Retrieval-Augmented Generation, hallucination detection, sparse autoencoders, large language models, interpretability<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs) by grounding text generation in retrieved evidence but struggles with hallucinations where outputs contradict or go beyond sources.  
2. Existing hallucination detection methods either require large annotated datasets for training detectors or use external LLM judges, both having drawbacks like high cost or limited accuracy.  
3. To address this, the authors leverage mechanistic interpretability using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to isolate internal activations specifically triggered during hallucinations in RAG.  
4. They develop RAGLens, a lightweight detector that uses LLM’s internal representations combined with information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling to accurately identify unfaithful outputs.  
5. RAGLens outperforms existing methods, offers interpretable rationales for detection decisions, enables effective post-hoc mitigation of hallucinations, and provides new insights into how hallucination signals are distributed within LLMs.  
6. The paper also shares the code publicly for reproducibility and further research. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by grounding outputs in retrieved evidence, but faithfulness failures, where generations contradict or extend beyond the provided sources, remain a critical challenge. Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens.

<title>ThreadWeaver: Adaptive Threading for Efficient Parallel Reasoning in Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07843</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07843</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, adaptive parallel reasoning, ThreadWeaver, chain-of-thought, inference efficiency<br /><br />Summary:  
1) The paper addresses the latency challenges in Large Language Models (LLMs) caused by inherently sequential decoding during complex reasoning tasks.  
2) It introduces ThreadWeaver, a novel framework for adaptive parallel reasoning designed to reduce inference time while maintaining accuracy comparable to popular sequential reasoning models.  
3) ThreadWeaver incorporates three key innovations: a two-stage parallel trajectory generator for creating extensive, high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data with parallel annotations; a trie-based training and inference co-design that supports parallel reasoning on standard autoregressive inference engines without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that helps balance accuracy and parallelization efficiency.  
4) Experiments conducted using ThreadWeaver on the Qwen3-8B model across six difficult mathematical reasoning benchmarks show it achieves an average accuracy of 71.9%, and up to 79.9% on AIME24, which is comparable to state-of-the-art sequential reasoning baselines.  
5) ThreadWeaver also provides up to a 1.53x speedup in token-level inference latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier that optimally balances accuracy and computational efficiency in reasoning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2512.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling inference-time computation has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve strong reasoning performance, but inherently sequential decoding leads to substantial latency, especially on complex tasks. Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, ranking system, MixLM, throughput optimization, search relevance<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Large language models (LLMs) are highly effective at capturing semantic nuances, resulting in impressive relevance ranking in recommendation and search systems, but they face challenges due to high computational overhead and latency concerns in industrial applications. <br /><br />2. Traditional cross-encoder ranking systems demand processing long context inputs, which combine user, query, and item information, leading to heavy computational workloads. <br /><br />3. The paper introduces MixLM, an innovative LLM-based ranking framework that greatly improves throughput by reducing input context length, while maintaining the semantic capabilities of cross-encoder rankers.<br /><br />4. MixLM uses a "mix-interaction" approach that represents inputs as a combination of text and embedding tokens. Specifically, all catalog items are pre-encoded into a few embedding tokens stored in a nearline cache, drastically reducing the item input size from thousands of text tokens to just a few embedding tokens during inference. <br /><br />5. The authors detail the deployment of MixLM in a real-world LinkedIn search system, describing training and serving infrastructure optimizations. Compared to strong baselines, MixLM achieves a 10x increase in throughput at the same latency budget and maintains relevance metrics, enabling full-traffic LLM-powered search with a resulting 0.47% increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) in online A/B testing. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing semantic nuances and therefore show impressive relevance ranking performance in modern recommendation and search systems. However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. Comparing with strong baselines, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x under the same latency budget, while maintaining relevance metrics. The efficiency gains delivered by MixLM enabled full-traffic deployment of LLM-powered search, which resulted in a significant 0.47% increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) in online A/B tests.

Abstract: Cities are complex, adaptive systems whose underlying principles remain difficult to disentangle despite unprecedented data abundance. Urban science therefore faces a fundamental challenge: converting vast, fragmented and interdisciplinary information into coherent explanations of how cities function and evolve. The emergence of AI scientists, i.e., agents capable of autonomous reasoning, hypothesis formation and data-driven experimentation, offers a new pathway toward accelerating this transformation, yet general-purpose systems fall short of the domain knowledge and methodological depth required for urban science research. Here we introduce a knowledge-driven AI Urban Scientist, built from hypotheses, peer-review signals, datasets and analytical patterns distilled from thousands of high-quality studies, and implemented as a coordinated multi-agent framework for end-to-end inquiry. The system generates structured hypotheses, retrieves and harmonizes heterogeneous datasets, conducts automated empirical analysis and simulation, and synthesizes insights in forms compatible with urban scientific reasoning. By providing reusable analytical tools and supporting community-driven extensions, the AI Urban Scientist lowers barriers to advanced urban analytics and acts not merely as an assistant but as an active collaborator in revealing the mechanisms that shape urban systems and in guiding the design of more resilient and equitable cities.

<title>Beyond Unified Models: A Service-Oriented Approach to Low Latency, Context Aware Phonemization for Real Time TTS</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08006</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08006</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: text-to-speech, phonemization, real-time, G2P, service-oriented architecture<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of balancing phonemization quality with inference speed in grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) aided text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Lightweight phonemizers are efficient but often fail to handle context-dependent linguistic nuances, while more advanced phonemizers achieve better accuracy at the cost of higher computational demands, limiting real-time application. To overcome this, the authors propose a framework that integrates context-aware phonemization strategies in a lightweight manner. Central to their approach is a service-oriented TTS architecture that modularizes phonemization components as independent services, separating the resource-intensive context-aware processes from the core TTS engine. This decoupling reduces latency and enables the use of sophisticated phonemization models without compromising real-time responsiveness. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system enhances pronunciation accuracy and linguistic soundness compared to conventional lightweight phonemizers. Moreover, the architecture supports offline operation and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Thus, the paper presents a practical solution to deploy high-quality, context-aware phonemization in real-time TTS applications, improving accessibility and user experience across varied computational environments. <div>
arXiv:2512.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightweight, real-time text-to-speech systems are crucial for accessibility. However, the most efficient TTS models often rely on lightweight phonemizers that struggle with context-dependent challenges. In contrast, more advanced phonemizers with a deeper linguistic understanding typically incur high computational costs, which prevents real-time performance.
  This paper examines the trade-off between phonemization quality and inference speed in G2P-aided TTS systems, introducing a practical framework to bridge this gap. We propose lightweight strategies for context-aware phonemization and a service-oriented TTS architecture that executes these modules as independent services. This design decouples heavy context-aware components from the core TTS engine, effectively breaking the latency barrier and enabling real-time use of high-quality phonemization models. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system improves pronunciation soundness and linguistic accuracy while maintaining real-time responsiveness, making it well-suited for offline and end-device TTS applications.

<title>Balanced Accuracy: The Right Metric for Evaluating LLM Judges - Explained through Youden's J statistic</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08121</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08121</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: large language models, evaluation metrics, classifier selection, Youden's J statistic, Balanced Accuracy<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. Evaluating large language models (LLMs) relies on measuring the prevalence of certain behaviors, either desirable (e.g., task pass rates) or undesirable (e.g., policy violations), which depends heavily on the choice of classifier serving as the judge.  
2. Typical metrics used to select classifiers, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1-score, suffer from sensitivity to class imbalance and rely on arbitrary designation of the positive class, often leading to biased or misleading prevalence estimates.  
3. The authors argue that Youden's J statistic is theoretically the most appropriate metric for choosing classifiers when comparing LLMs because it properly balances true positive and true negative rates, independent of class imbalance.  
4. Balanced Accuracy is mathematically equivalent to a linear transformation of Youden's J statistic, making it a practical and interpretable alternative for classifier selection.  
5. Through theoretical analysis, empirical evaluations, and simulations, the study demonstrates that selecting classifiers based on Balanced Accuracy yields more reliable and robust prevalence estimates, thereby improving the trustworthiness of LLM evaluations. <div>
arXiv:2512.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigorous evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies on comparing models by the prevalence of desirable or undesirable behaviors, such as task pass rates or policy violations. These prevalence estimates are produced by a classifier, either an LLM-as-a-judge or human annotators, making the choice of classifier central to trustworthy evaluation. Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection.

<div> Keywords: large language models, CFA exams, reasoning models, Gemini 3.0 Pro, exam performance<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Previous research indicated that large language models (LLMs) performed poorly on the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exams. However, newer reasoning models have demonstrated strong capabilities on graduate-level academic and professional tests across diverse fields. This study evaluates state-of-the-art reasoning models using a comprehensive set of 980 mock CFA exam questions spanning all three exam levels: three Level I, two Level II, and three Level III exams. When applying the same pass/fail criteria from earlier work, the majority of these models successfully passed all three levels.

Abstract: Previous research has reported that large language models (LLMs) demonstrate poor performance on the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exams. However, recent reasoning models have achieved strong results on graduate-level academic and professional examinations across various disciplines. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art reasoning models on a set of mock CFA exams consisting of 980 questions across three Level I exams, two Level II exams, and three Level III exams. Using the same pass/fail criteria from prior studies, we find that most models clear all three levels. The models that pass, ordered by overall performance, are Gemini 3.0 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, Claude Opus 4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1. Specifically, Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves a record score of 97.6% on Level I. Performance is also strong on Level II, led by GPT-5 at 94.3%. On Level III, Gemini 2.5 Pro attains the highest score with 86.4% on multiple-choice questions while Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves 92.0% on constructed-response questions.

<div> Keywords: workplace toxicity, Large Language Models, Multi-Agent Systems, Monte Carlo simulation, operational efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study investigates the impact of workplace toxicity on operational efficiency by using Large Language Model (LLM) based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate adversarial 1-on-1 debates in a controlled environment dubbed a "sociological sandbox." By employing a Monte Carlo method, hundreds of simulated discussions were conducted to compare convergence times—the number of arguments needed to reach conclusions—between baseline control groups and groups with agents programmed with toxic behaviors via system prompts. The findings reveal that conversations involving toxic agents took approximately 25% longer to conclude, demonstrating a significant increase in latency due to toxicity. This increased duration is proposed as a quantifiable proxy for financial damage caused by toxic social dynamics in corporate and academic environments. Additionally, the study highlights the ethical and practical advantages of agent-based modeling, as it provides a reproducible and ethically sound alternative to traditional human-subject research for studying social friction and conflict mechanics. This approach circumvents the challenges of experimentally reproducing interpersonal conflict among humans while offering insight into the mechanics and costs of workplace toxicity. <div>

Abstract: Workplace toxicity is widely recognized as detrimental to organizational culture, yet quantifying its direct impact on operational efficiency remains methodologically challenging due to the ethical and practical difficulties of reproducing conflict in human subjects. This study leverages Large Language Model (LLM) based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate 1-on-1 adversarial debates, creating a controlled "sociological sandbox". We employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate hundrets of discussions, measuring the convergence time (defined as the number of arguments required to reach a conclusion) between a baseline control group and treatment groups involving agents with "toxic" system prompts. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of approximately 25\% in the duration of conversations involving toxic participants. We propose that this "latency of toxicity" serves as a proxy for financial damage in corporate and academic settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that agent-based modeling provides a reproducible, ethical alternative to human-subject research for measuring the mechanics of social friction.

<div> Keywords: ontology, knowledge graph, industrial standards, LLM-based triple extraction, rule-based QA<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This paper addresses the challenge of constructing ontology-based knowledge graphs (KGs) from industrial standards, which include complex structured information such as tables, scopes, constraints, exceptions, and numerical rules.  
2. The authors propose a novel method that organizes industrial documents into hierarchical semantic structures and decomposes sentences and tables into atomic propositions derived from conditional and numerical rules.  
3. The method leverages large language model (LLM)-based triple extraction to integrate these atomic propositions into an ontology-enriched knowledge graph, effectively capturing both hierarchy and logic within the documents.  
4. To validate their approach, the researchers created datasets focused on rules, tables, multi-hop question answering (QA), and toxic clause detection specifically from industrial standards.  
5. Experimental results showed that their ontology-aware KG-RAG framework significantly outperforms existing KG-RAG methods across all QA types, demonstrating that scalable and reliable knowledge representation for complex industrial documentation is achievable, promoting advancements in domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and intelligent document management systems. <div>

Abstract: Ontology-based knowledge graph (KG) construction is a core technology that enables multidimensional understanding and advanced reasoning over domain knowledge. Industrial standards, in particular, contain extensive technical information and complex rules presented in highly structured formats that combine tables, scopes of application, constraints, exceptions, and numerical calculations, making KG construction especially challenging. In this study, we propose a method that organizes such documents into a hierarchical semantic structure, decomposes sentences and tables into atomic propositions derived from conditional and numerical rules, and integrates them into an ontology-knowledge graph through LLM-based triple extraction. Our approach captures both the hierarchical and logical structures of documents, effectively representing domain-specific semantics that conventional methods fail to reflect. To verify its effectiveness, we constructed rule, table, and multi-hop QA datasets, as well as a toxic clause detection dataset, from industrial standards, and implemented an ontology-aware KG-RAG framework for comparative evaluation. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant performance improvements across all QA types compared to existing KG-RAG approaches. This study demonstrates that reliable and scalable knowledge representation is feasible even for industrial documents with intertwined conditions, constraints, and scopes, contributing to future domain-specific RAG development and intelligent document management.

<div> Multimodal Language Models, Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication, Model Compression, Knowledge Distillation, Efficient Inference

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of high computational demand in multimodal language models (MLLMs) required to align complex visual and linguistic data. It proposes a progressive reparameterization strategy that incrementally replaces dense feed-forward network blocks with compact Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layers. This transition is guided by a residual interpolation schedule combined with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses, ensuring that the newly introduced PHM layers replicate the functional behavior of the original dense layers during training. This approach yields significant reductions in both parameter count and floating-point operations (FLOPs), leading to faster inference times without compromising the quality of multimodal alignment. Evaluations across various vision-language models demonstrate that the method retains performance comparable to original models while substantially decreasing model size and latency. The technique also serves as a complementary solution to existing low-bit quantization methods, providing an architecture-compatible route toward more resource-efficient multimodal reasoning solutions. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLLMs) require large parameter capacity to align high-dimensional visual features with linguistic representations, making them computationally heavy and difficult to deploy efficiently. We introduce a progressive reparameterization strategy that compresses these models by gradually replacing dense feed-forward network blocks with compact Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layers. A residual interpolation schedule, together with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses, ensures that the PHM modules inherit the functional behavior of their dense counterparts during training. This transition yields substantial parameter and FLOP reductions while preserving strong multimodal alignment, enabling faster inference without degrading output quality. We evaluate the approach on multiple vision-language models (VLMs). Our method maintains performance comparable to the base models while delivering significant reductions in model size and inference latency. Progressive PHM substitution thus offers an architecture-compatible path toward more efficient multimodal reasoning and complements existing low-bit quantization techniques.

<div> Keywords: Sign Language Spotting, Automatic Sign Language Recognition, pose keypoints, binary classification, sign-to-sign retrieval  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces a novel task called Sign Language Spotting, which focuses on detecting the presence or absence of a specific query sign within continuous sign language sequences, addressing the largely unexplored problem of sign-to-sign retrieval. Unlike traditional methods that depend on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, the authors propose an end-to-end model that operates directly on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. The model uses an encoder-only backbone paired with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign exists within the target sequence. Utilizing pose representations instead of raw RGB frames reduces computational overhead and lessens the impact of visual noise, enhancing the model's efficiency. The approach is evaluated on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving an accuracy of 61.88% and an F1-score of 60.00%. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed pose-based framework as a solid foundation for future work in automatic sign language retrieval and verification. The authors have also made their code publicly available to encourage further research in this area. <div>

Abstract: Automatic Sign Language Recognition (ASLR) has emerged as a vital field for bridging the gap between deaf and hearing communities. However, the problem of sign-to-sign retrieval or detecting a specific sign within a sequence of continuous signs remains largely unexplored. We define this novel task as Sign Language Spotting. In this paper, we present a first step toward sign language retrieval by addressing the challenge of detecting the presence or absence of a query sign video within a sentence-level gloss or sign video. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, we propose an end-to-end model that directly operates on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. Our architecture employs an encoder-only backbone with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign appears within the target sequence. By focusing on pose representations instead of raw RGB frames, our method significantly reduces computational cost and mitigates visual noise. We evaluate our approach on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving 61.88\% accuracy and 60.00\% F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pose-based framework for Sign Language Spotting, establishing a strong foundation for future research in automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

<div> scaling laws, large language models, downstream performance, power law, training budget<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper revisits the problem of predicting downstream task performance of large language models (LLMs) based on their training budget, challenging the traditional reliance on proxy metrics like pretraining loss. It proposes a direct modeling framework that correlates benchmark performance with the training budget through a simple power law when maintaining a fixed token-to-parameter ratio. The study demonstrates that this direct approach outperforms the previously used two-stage procedure, which is susceptible to compounding errors when extrapolating model performance. Additionally, the authors develop functional forms capable of predicting accuracy across varying token-to-parameter ratios while factoring in inference compute costs, including repeated sampling. Their empirical validation spans models with up to 17 billion parameters, trained on datasets consisting of up to 350 billion tokens drawn from two different mixtures. The paper emphasizes reproducibility by releasing the entire set of pretraining losses alongside downstream evaluation results. Overall, the research provides a more reliable and generalizable method to predict LLM performance across diverse settings, which could guide efficient allocation of compute resources during model development. <div>

Abstract: While scaling laws for Large Language Models (LLMs) traditionally focus on proxy metrics like pretraining loss, predicting downstream task performance has been considered unreliable. This paper challenges that view by proposing a direct framework to model the scaling of benchmark performance from the training budget. We find that for a fixed token-to-parameter ratio, a simple power law can accurately describe the scaling behavior of log accuracy on multiple popular downstream tasks. Our results show that the direct approach extrapolates better than the previously proposed two-stage procedure, which is prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, we introduce functional forms that predict accuracy across token-to-parameter ratios and account for inference compute under repeated sampling. We validate our findings on models with up to 17B parameters trained on up to 350B tokens across two dataset mixtures. To support reproducibility and encourage future research, we release the complete set of pretraining losses and downstream evaluation results.

<div> Keywords: personal values, social media, Russian language, annotation, transformer models  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study addresses the challenge of detecting personal value-expressive posts within Russian social media, specifically on VKontakte. Personal values are defined as concepts or beliefs concerning desirable end-states that go beyond specific situations, and their study through social media can shed light on societal value evolution, particularly in populations difficult to survey through traditional methods. However, user-generated content in social media is often influenced by culturally stereotyped speech rather than genuine personal value expression, complicating detection efforts. The authors developed a training dataset of 5,035 VKontakte posts annotated by three experts, 304 crowd-workers, and ChatGPT. Agreement between experts and crowd-workers was moderate, while ChatGPT showed higher consistency but had limitations with spam detection. To improve annotation quality, an ensemble approach combining human and AI assistance with active learning was employed. Multiple classification models were then trained using embeddings from various pre-trained transformer models. The finest results were obtained using embeddings from a fine-tuned rubert-tiny2 model, which achieved an F1 score of 0.77 and an F1-macro of 0.83, indicating strong performance in identifying value-expressive content. This model represents a significant advancement in studying personal values within Russian social media users and supports future research into values dynamics across user groups. <div>

Abstract: Basic values are concepts or beliefs which pertain to desirable end-states and transcend specific situations. Studying personal values in social media can illuminate how and why societal values evolve especially when the stimuli-based methods, such as surveys, are inefficient, for instance, in hard-to-reach populations. On the other hand, user-generated content is driven by the massive use of stereotyped, culturally defined speech constructions rather than authentic expressions of personal values. We aimed to find a model that can accurately detect value-expressive posts in Russian social media VKontakte. A training dataset of 5,035 posts was annotated by three experts, 304 crowd-workers and ChatGPT. Crowd-workers and experts showed only moderate agreement in categorizing posts. ChatGPT was more consistent but struggled with spam detection. We applied an ensemble of human- and AI-assisted annotation involving active learning approach, subsequently trained several classification models using embeddings from various pre-trained transformer-based language models. The best performance was achieved with embeddings from a fine-tuned rubert-tiny2 model, yielding high value detection quality (F1 = 0.77, F1-macro = 0.83). This model provides a crucial step to a study of values within and between Russian social media users.

<div> Keywords: B-cos networks, language models, explainability, natural language processing, post-hoc explanations<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses limitations in post-hoc explanation methods for black-box models, which often lack faithfulness and human interpretability due to neural architecture constraints. The authors focus on B-cos networks, which improve model explainability by removing bias terms and encouraging alignment between inputs and weights. Although previously successful in computer vision, B-cos networks had limited application in natural language processing (NLP). The work introduces B-cos Language Models (B-cos LMs), a novel approach that converts pre-trained language models into B-cos LMs through a combined B-cos conversion and task-specific fine-tuning process. This method enhances efficiency over prior techniques. Both automatic and human evaluations reveal that B-cos LMs generate explanations that are more faithful and easily interpretable than those produced by traditional post-hoc methods, while maintaining competitive task performance. The study also provides an in-depth analysis comparing the learning dynamics and explanation patterns of B-cos LMs versus conventionally fine-tuned models. Additionally, the paper explores the transformation of decoder-only language models into B-cos LMs, expanding their applicability to generation tasks. The authors have made their implementation publicly accessible via GitHub to encourage further research and adoption in the NLP community. <div>

Abstract: Post-hoc explanation methods for black-box models often struggle with faithfulness and human interpretability due to the lack of explainability in current neural architectures. Meanwhile, B-cos networks have been introduced to improve model explainability by proposing an architecture that removes bias terms and promotes input-weight alignment. Although B-cos networks have shown success in building explainable systems, their application has so far been limited to computer vision models and their associated training pipelines. In this work, we introduce B-cos LMs, i.e., B-cos Language Models (LMs) empowered for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Our approach directly transforms pre-trained language models into B-cos LMs by combining B-cos conversion and task fine-tuning, improving efficiency compared to previous methods. Automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate that B-cos LMs produce more faithful and human interpretable explanations than post-hoc methods, while maintaining task performance comparable to conventional fine-tuning. Our in-depth analysis explores how B-cos LMs differ from conventionally fine-tuned models in their learning processes and explanation patterns. Finally, we present a first exploration of transforming decoder-only models to B-cos LMs for generation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ewanwong/bcos_lm.

This article addresses the critical global health issue of mental disorders by exploring the role of social media as a platform for real-time digital phenotyping and intervention. It highlights Large Language Models (LLMs) as powerful tools that offer improved semantic understanding and reasoning compared to traditional deep learning methods, while acknowledging their current limitations such as hallucinations and lack of persistent memory in clinical settings. The paper systematically surveys advanced enhancement techniques, specifically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic systems, that can help overcome these shortcomings by reducing hallucinations and enabling autonomous reasoning and multi-step interventions. The review organizes existing research across various technical paradigms and clinical targets, broadening the scope beyond common internalizing disorders to include psychotic disorders and externalizing behaviors. Furthermore, the study comprehensively evaluates the performance of LLMs with and without RAG across multiple tasks, establishing a unified benchmark for the field. Ultimately, this work aims to facilitate the development of trustworthy, autonomous AI systems capable of providing precise, explainable, and effective mental health support through social media analysis. <div>

Abstract: Mental disorders represent a critical global health challenge, and social media is increasingly viewed as a vital resource for real-time digital phenotyping and intervention. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer stronger semantic understanding and reasoning than traditional deep learning, but their use in high-stakes clinical settings is limited by hallucinations and the lack of persistent memory. However, existing literature has not sufficiently investigated how advanced enhancement techniques, specifically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic systems, can address these reliability and reasoning limitations. Here, we systematically survey the evolving landscape of LLM-based methods for social media mental disorder analysis, spanning standard pretrained language models, RAG to mitigate hallucinations and contextual gaps, and agentic systems for autonomous reasoning and multi-step intervention. We organize existing work by technical paradigm and clinical target, extending beyond common internalizing disorders to include psychotic disorders and externalizing behaviors. Additionally, the paper comprehensively evaluates the performance of LLMs, including the impact of RAG, across various tasks. This work establishes a unified benchmark for the field, paving the way for the development of trustworthy, autonomous AI systems that can deliver precise and explainable mental health support.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models like Gemini, GPT, and others, bridging the gap between the human brain and language processing has become an important area of focus. To address this challenge, researchers have developed various models to decode EEG signals into text. However, these models still face significant performance limitations. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a new model, R1 Translator, which aims to improve the performance of EEG-to-text decoding. The R1 Translator model combines a bidirectional LSTM encoder with a pretrained transformer-based decoder, utilizing EEG features to produce high-quality text outputs. The model processes EEG embeddings through the LSTM to capture sequential dependencies, which are then fed into the transformer decoder for effective text generation. The R1 Translator excels in ROUGE metrics, outperforming both T5 (previous research) and Brain Translator. Specifically, R1 achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 38.00% (P), which is up to 9% higher than T5 (34.89%) and 3% better than Brain (35.69%). It also leads in ROUGE-L, with a F1 score of 32.51%, outperforming T5 by 3% (29.67%) and Brain by 2% (30.38%). In terms of CER, R1 achieves a CER of 0.5795, which is 2% lower than T5 (0.5917) and 4% lower than Brain (0.6001). Additionally, R1 performs better in WER with a score of 0.7280, outperforming T5 by 4.3% (0.7610) and Brain by 3.6% (0.7553). Code is available at https://github.com/Mmurrad/EEG-To-text.

The paper addresses the challenge of detecting harmful queries posed to large language models (LLMs), a crucial step to mitigate risks of misuse. 2. Current harmful prompt detection methods are vulnerable, especially when attackers exploit generalization gaps across languages or input modalities like images and audio. 3. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose Omniguard, a detection approach that leverages internal representations of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) aligned across languages and modalities. 4. Omniguard uses these aligned embeddings to build classifiers that are language-agnostic and modality-agnostic, enhancing detection robustness. 5. Experimental results show Omniguard improves classification accuracy by 11.57% over prior best methods in multilingual text, by 20.44% for image-based prompts, and establishes new state-of-the-art accuracy for audio-based prompts. 6. Additionally, Omniguard repurposes embeddings already computed during generation, resulting in significant efficiency gains—about 120 times faster than the next fastest baseline. 7. The authors have released code and data publicly, facilitating further research and development in safe and robust harmful prompt detection across diverse inputs. <div>

Abstract: The emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked concerns about their immediate potential for harmful misuse. The core approach to mitigate these concerns is the detection of harmful queries to the model. Current detection approaches are fallible, and are particularly susceptible to attacks that exploit mismatched generalization of model capabilities (e.g., prompts in low-resource languages or prompts provided in non-text modalities such as image and audio). To tackle this challenge, we propose Omniguard, an approach for detecting harmful prompts across languages and modalities. Our approach (i) identifies internal representations of an LLM/MLLM that are aligned across languages or modalities and then (ii) uses them to build a language-agnostic or modality-agnostic classifier for detecting harmful prompts. Omniguard improves harmful prompt classification accuracy by 11.57\% over the strongest baseline in a multilingual setting, by 20.44\% for image-based prompts, and sets a new SOTA for audio-based prompts. By repurposing embeddings computed during generation, Omniguard is also very efficient ($\approx\!120 \times$ faster than the next fastest baseline).

Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique opportunity to reinvigorate research on Knowledge Engineering (KE) automation. This trend is already evident in recent efforts developing LLM-based methods and tools for the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs), natural language questions used by ontology engineers to define the functional requirements of an ontology. However, the evaluation of these tools lacks standardization. This undermines the methodological rigor and hinders the replication and comparison of results. To address this gap, we introduce Bench4KE, an extensible API-based benchmarking system for KE automation. The presented release focuses on evaluating tools that generate CQs automatically. Bench4KE provides a curated gold standard consisting of CQ datasets from 17 real-world ontology engineering projects and uses a suite of similarity metrics to assess the quality of the CQs generated. We present a comparative analysis of 6 recent CQ generation systems, which are based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future research. Bench4KE is also designed to accommodate additional KE automation tasks, such as SPARQL query generation, ontology testing and drafting. Code and datasets are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

<div> Keywords: verifiers, language models, Weaver framework, weak supervision, ensemble learning  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces Weaver, a novel framework designed to create a strong verifier for language model outputs by combining multiple weak and imperfect verifiers. Traditional verifiers like humans are accurate but unscalable, while automated tools often lack utility or precision. Weaver improves upon this by forming weighted ensembles of verifiers, which outperform unweighted combinations due to varying verifier accuracies, but typically need labeled data for training. To reduce reliance on labeled datasets, Weaver applies weak supervision techniques to estimate each verifier’s reliability and aggregates their outputs into a unified, more accurate quality score. The framework also tackles practical challenges such as inconsistent output formats among verifiers and low-quality verifier filtering by using dataset statistics for normalization and selection. Evaluations demonstrate that Weaver significantly enhances Pass@1 performance in reasoning and math tasks by effectively selecting the best candidate from multiple generated responses. Using Llama 3.3 70B Instruct as a generator with an ensemble of 70B or smaller judge and reward models as verifiers, Weaver achieves an average accuracy of 87.7%, comparable to the improvement seen between GPT-4o and o3-mini models, which required extensive finetuning. To lower computational costs, the authors additionally train a 400M parameter cross-encoder based on Weaver’s combined scoring outputs. <div>

Abstract: Verifiers can improve language model capabilities by scoring and ranking responses from generated candidates. Currently, high-quality verifiers are either unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean). While LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose verifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle verifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we introduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining multiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers, which typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform unweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce dependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each verifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better reflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision algorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and handling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics to normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers. We study Weaver's effectiveness in test-time repeated sampling, where a model generates multiple candidate responses and selects one. Our evaluations show Weaver significantly improves over Pass@1-performance when selecting the first candidate-across reasoning and math tasks, achieving o3-mini-level accuracy with Llama 3.3 70B Instruct as generator, and an ensemble of 70B or smaller judge and reward models as verifiers (87.7% average). This gain mirrors the jump between GPT-4o and o3-mini (69.0% vs. 86.7%), which required extensive finetuning and post-training. To reduce computational costs of verifier ensembles, we train a 400M cross-encoder using Weaver's combined output scores.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, KV compression, approximate leverage scores, context-calibrated compression, memory efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper introduces Compactor, a novel training-free, query-agnostic key-value (KV) compression method that leverages approximate leverage scores to assess token importance in large language models. <br /><br />2. Compactor outperforms competing KV compression methods by retaining 20% fewer tokens while maintaining equivalent performance across various synthetic and real-world context tasks, demonstrating enhanced task robustness.<br /><br />3. A context-calibrated compression procedure is proposed to infer the maximum compression level for a given context without significant performance degradation, enabling dynamic adjustment for different input scenarios.<br /><br />4. Using this calibrated approach, Compactor achieves full KV performance on the Longbench benchmark while reducing KV memory consumption by an average of 68%, addressing the critical memory bottleneck in LLM deployment.<br /><br />5. To validate its generalizability, Compactor is evaluated on 27 synthetic and real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, employing models from the Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.1 families. Additionally, the authors release compactor-vllm, an inference engine with optimized Triton kernels that efficiently handle sparse, non-contiguous memory accesses inherent in compressed KV caches, reinforcing its practical applicability in real-world LLM systems. <div>

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very large context windows. We present Compactor, a training-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining 20% fewer tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, while being more task-robust. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated compression: inferring the maximum compression a given context supports before significant performance loss. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV memory burden by 68%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.1 families. Finally, we release compactor-vllm, an inference engine and suite of optimized Triton kernels designed to efficiently support the sparse, non-contiguous memory access patterns inherent to compressed KV caches. This work demonstrates that Compactor offers a practical, high-performance solution for alleviating the memory bottleneck in modern LLM deployment.

<title>CLARIFID: Improving Radiology Report Generation by Reinforcing Clinically Accurate Impressions and Enforcing Detailed Findings</title>

<div> Keywords: radiology reports, diagnostic correctness, section-aware pretraining, Proximal Policy Optimization, multi-view encoder<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces CLARIFID, a novel framework for automatic generation of radiology reports aimed at improving diagnostic correctness. Unlike prior methods that mainly focus on generating fluent text, CLARIFID mirrors the expert workflow by learning the logical flow from the Findings section to the Impression section through section-aware pretraining. The model is fine-tuned using Proximal Policy Optimization, with the CheXbert F1 score of the Impression as the reward to directly optimize clinical accuracy. To maintain coherent reasoning, CLARIFID employs controlled decoding that first completes the Findings section before synthesizing the Impression. Additionally, it integrates multiple chest X-ray views via a vision-transformer-based multi-view encoder to enhance diagnostic comprehensiveness. During inference, a next-token forcing strategy with report-level re-ranking ensures comprehensive and logically consistent report generation. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate that CLARIFID significantly outperforms existing baselines on clinical efficacy metrics, producing reports with superior clinical reliability and diagnostic value. This approach addresses the key limitations of previous methods by focusing on factual correctness and multi-view image fusion, offering a promising solution to reduce radiologists’ workload through more accurate automated reporting. <div>

Abstract: Automatic generation of radiology reports has the potential to alleviate radiologists' significant workload, yet current methods struggle to deliver clinically reliable conclusions. In particular, most prior approaches focus on producing fluent text without effectively ensuring the factual correctness of the reports and often rely on single-view images, limiting diagnostic comprehensiveness. We propose CLARIFID, a novel framework that directly optimizes diagnostic correctness by mirroring the two-step workflow of experts. Specifically, CLARIFID (1) learns the logical flow from Findings to Impression through section-aware pretraining, (2) is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization in which the CheXbert F1 score of the Impression section serves as the reward, (3) employs controlled decoding that completes "Findings" before synthesizing the "Impression", and (4) fuses multiple chest X-ray views via a vision-transformer-based multi-view encoder. During inference, we apply a next-token forcing strategy followed by report-level re-ranking, ensuring that the model first produces a comprehensive "Findings" section before synthesizing the "Impression" and thereby preserving coherent clinical reasoning. Experimental results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior clinical efficacy and outperforms existing baselines on clinical efficacy scores.

<title>LLMs Can't Handle Peer Pressure: Crumbling under Multi-Agent Social Interactions</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, multi-agent systems, social dynamics, rapport, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the integration of large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent systems (MAS) where agents interact socially to influence decisions. Unlike previous studies focusing mainly on conformity bias, the work broadens the scope to explore how LLMs establish rapport, identify and incorporate high-quality peer information, and resist misleading inputs—skills critical for collective intelligence in complex social contexts. The authors introduce KAIROS, a novel benchmark that simulates quiz-style collaboration among peer agents with controllable rapport levels and behaviors, both from past interactions and in real-time. This setup allows for systematic study of the interplay between rapport, peer behavior, and the model’s self-confidence in shaping decision-making. Using KAIROS, the paper evaluates different training methods including prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning through Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO). Key findings reveal that model scale plays a significant role in moderating social influence susceptibility: larger models are more robust and can benefit from prompting-based strategies, while smaller models remain vulnerable. Moreover, only carefully designed GRPO training reliably improves robustness and boosts performance in smaller LLMs. This highlights the importance of training configurations and model size in achieving resilient multi-agent collaboration. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent systems (MAS), where peer interactions shape individual decisions. While prior work has mainly examined conformity bias, we broaden the view to include how LLMs build rapport from prior interactions, discern and integrate high-quality peer information, and resist misleading inputs-abilities essential for achieving collective intelligence under complex social dynamics. We introduce KAIROS, a benchmark that simulates quiz-style collaboration with peer agents whose rapport levels and behaviours can be precisely controlled in both historical interactions and the current round. This unified setup enables systematic analysis of how rapport, peer actions, and the model's self-confidence jointly influence decision-making. Using KAIROS, we evaluate prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO). Results show that model scale is a primary factor moderating susceptibility to social influence: larger models are more resilient and benefit from prompting-based mitigation, whereas smaller models remain vulnerable. Only carefully configured GRPO training yields consistent robustness and performance gains for small models.

<div> Keywords: SENSE, SAMU-XLSR, speech encoder, multilingual semantic tasks, SpeechBrain<br /><br />Summary: This paper presents SENSE (Shared Embedding for N-lingual Speech and tExt), an open-source framework designed to align speech and text representations across multiple languages. Inspired by the SAMU-XLSR framework and similar in concept to Meta AI’s SONAR models, SENSE employs a teacher-student architecture where a self-supervised speech encoder is aligned with language-agnostic continuous text representations at the utterance level. Improvements over the original SAMU-XLSR method include the use of a stronger teacher text model and a superior initial speech encoder, leading to enhanced performance. The authors have integrated SENSE’s training and deployment code into the SpeechBrain toolkit, facilitating accessibility and reproducibility. The first SENSE model trained by the authors has been publicly released to promote further research and application development. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the SENSE model achieves highly competitive results on various multilingual and multimodal semantic tasks, validating its effectiveness. Additionally, the study offers valuable insights into how semantics are captured within semantically aligned speech encoders, potentially informing future advancements in cross-modal and cross-lingual representation learning. <div>

<div> Keywords: LLM interpretability, activation verbalization, verbalizer LLM, benchmark evaluation, internal representations<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. Recent interpretability techniques use a secondary verbalizer large language model (LLM) to translate internal activations of a target LLM into natural language descriptions aiming to reveal how the target model processes inputs.<br />2. The study questions whether these activation verbalization methods truly access privileged information about the target model’s internal workings or if they simply restate information already present in the inputs.<br />3. Evaluation of popular verbalization methods across previously used datasets shows that these methods can perform well even without any access to the target model’s internals, indicating limitations in current benchmark datasets.<br />4. Controlled experiments demonstrate that the generated verbalizations often reflect the knowledge and biases of the verbalizer LLM itself rather than the internal knowledge or reasoning of the target LLM from which activations are decoded.<br />5. The findings highlight the necessity for more carefully designed benchmarks and experimental controls to critically assess whether activation verbalization methods yield authentic insights into how LLMs operate internally. <div>

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they can succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets may not be ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the knowledge of the target LLM whose activations are decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs.

<title>Bridging the Knowledge-Prediction Gap in LLMs on Multiple-Choice Questions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23782</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, multiple-choice questions, knowledge-prediction gap, latent subspace, KAPPA<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit a discrepancy between their demonstrated knowledge and their performance on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), frequently failing despite having correct underlying knowledge. To explore this phenomenon, the authors carry out a probing analysis focusing on residual streams within certain model layers, identifying a key subspace composed of two bases: a knowledge basis representing the probability of the ground-truth answer, and a prediction basis corresponding to the model's chosen answer probability. The root cause of incorrect MCQ predictions is found to be misalignment between the hidden states’ coordinates in these two bases. To address this, the paper proposes KAPPA (Knowledge-Aligned Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free method that adjusts hidden states to better align the prediction coordinate with the knowledge coordinate within the identified subspace. Experimental evaluations on datasets like Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, it is demonstrated that while optimal subspaces vary by task, they generalize across datasets to a fair degree. KAPPA's effectiveness also extends beyond MCQs to free-form question answering. This study offers a novel geometric perspective on the knowledge-prediction gap and introduces a practical technique to better align LLM behavior with its inherent knowledge. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

<title>Dual Mechanisms of Value Expression: Intrinsic vs. Prompted Values in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24319</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: large language models, value expression, value vectors, value neurons, value steerability<br /><br />Summary: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) express values through two mechanisms: intrinsic expression, which reflects values learned inherently during training, and prompted expression, which arises from explicit prompts. The authors explore whether these two mechanisms overlap or differ significantly by analyzing them at a mechanistic level using two methods: value vectors, representing value directions extracted from the model’s residual stream, and value neurons, specific MLP neurons contributing to value expression. The study finds that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms share some key components essential for value expression but also contain distinct unique elements. These unique elements result in differing effects on value steerability and response diversity—prompted mechanisms lead to higher steerability in guiding the model’s responses, while intrinsic mechanisms generate greater lexical diversity. Furthermore, components unique to intrinsic value expression encourage more varied language use in outputs. In contrast, those specific to prompted expression enhance following instructions robustly, including in challenging settings like jailbreaking tasks, indicating different underlying functional roles for each mechanism in value expression within LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2509.24319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts. Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream, and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

<title>LLMSQL: Upgrading WikiSQL for the LLM Era of Text-to-SQL</title>

<div> Keywords: text-to-SQL, WikiSQL, large language models, dataset revision, SQL query generation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the task of converting natural language questions into SQL queries, a crucial function allowing non-expert users to interact with relational databases. It identifies several issues in the widely used WikiSQL dataset, such as inconsistencies related to case sensitivity, mismatches in data types, syntax errors, and questions that remained unanswered. To remedy these problems, the authors introduce LLMSQL, a thoroughly revised and transformed version of WikiSQL designed specifically for the modern era of large language models (LLMs). The revision process involved categorizing various types of errors and applying automated cleaning and re-annotation methodologies. To evaluate the benefits of these improvements, multiple large language models were tested, including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral 7B, and others. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 achieved an impressive 88.40% accuracy in zero-shot settings, and models with fewer than 10 billion parameters exceeded 90% accuracy following fine-tuning. Importantly, LLMSQL is presented not merely as an updated dataset but as an LLM-ready benchmark that differs from the original WikiSQL. Unlike the original dataset designed for pointer-network models, LLMSQL offers clean natural language questions paired with complete SQL queries as plain text, facilitating easier generation and evaluation by current natural-language-to-SQL systems. <div>

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries enables non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset played a key role in early text-to-SQL research, its usage has declined due to structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies, data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the large language model era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated multiple large language models, including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral 7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and others. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 achieves 88.40% accuracy in a zero-shot setting, and models under 10B parameters surpass 90% accuracy after fine-tuning. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready benchmark. Unlike the original WikiSQL, which was tailored for pointer-network models selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and evaluation for modern natural-language-to-SQL models.

<div> deliberation summarization, large-scale dataset, fairness, minority representation, evaluation metrics<br /><br />Summary: This article addresses the challenge of summarizing large-scale public deliberations, which involve thousands of free-form contributions, into representative and neutral summaries suitable for policymaking. It highlights the risks of using large language models (LLMs) for this purpose, including bias toward input order and underrepresentation of minority perspectives, raising important fairness concerns. To provide a solution, the authors introduce DeliberationBank, a comprehensive human-grounded dataset containing opinion data from 3,000 participants across ten deliberation questions, along with summary judgment data annotated by 4,500 participants on four critical dimensions: representativeness, informativeness, neutrality, and policy approval. Leveraging this dataset, the authors develop DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model designed to evaluate deliberation summaries from individual perspectives more efficiently and with better alignment to human judgments compared to various LLM-based judges. Using DeliberationJudge, the study evaluates 18 different LLMs and uncovers persistent issues such as the underrepresentation of minority positions in deliberation summaries. Ultimately, this framework offers a scalable, reliable, and human-aligned approach to evaluating deliberation summarization, aiming to enhance fairness and representativeness in AI-assisted policymaking processes. <div>

Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness, informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative and equitable for policymaking.

<title>StreamingThinker: Large Language Models Can Think While Reading</title>

<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17238</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Streaming thinking, Large language models, Chain of Thought reasoning, Latency reduction, Parallel inference<br /><br />Summary: Large language models (LLMs) excel at chain of thought (CoT) reasoning but traditionally start reasoning only after receiving the full input, causing latency and diminished attention to early input in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition that thinks while reading, the authors propose a novel "streaming thinking" paradigm where reasoning occurs incrementally as input arrives and adjusts depth after the full input is processed. They develop StreamingThinker, a framework implementing this paradigm by integrating streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. StreamingThinker uses streaming reasoning units with quality control and enforces order-preserving reasoning via streaming attention masks and position encoding. It also employs parallel key-value caches to separate input encoding from reasoning generation, enabling true concurrency and alignment. Evaluations on the Qwen3 model family across math, logical, and context-based QA reasoning tasks demonstrate that StreamingThinker matches batch thinking performance while reducing token waiting time before reasoning onset by 80% and cutting final answer latency by over 60%. This shows the streaming paradigm’s effectiveness for improving reasoning efficiency in LLMs. Code will be publicly available at the provided GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker.

<div> Sound symbolism, Multimodal Large Language Models, phonetic iconicity, LEX-ICON dataset, phoneme-level attention<br /><br />Summary: This study explores sound symbolism, the non-arbitrary relationship between phonetic forms and meanings, as a means to understand how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process auditory information in human languages. Researchers evaluated MLLMs on phonetic iconicity using both textual inputs (orthographic and IPA) and auditory signals, examining up to 25 semantic dimensions such as sharpness versus roundness. To facilitate this, the study introduces LEX-ICON, a comprehensive dataset containing 8,052 mimetic words from four natural languages—English, French, Japanese, and Korean—alongside 2,930 pseudo-words, all annotated with semantic features across text and audio modalities. Key findings reveal that MLLMs demonstrate phonetic intuitions consistent with linguistic theories across multiple semantic dimensions. Additionally, the models exhibit distinctive phonosemantic attention patterns, focusing on iconic phonemes that reflect meaningful sound-meaning correspondences. This work bridges artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics by providing the first extensive, quantitative analysis of phonetic iconicity related to the interpretability of MLLMs, highlighting their capacity to encode and attend to sound symbolism in multimodal contexts. <div>

Abstract: Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.

Abstract: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

<title>TS-PEFT: Unveiling Token-Level Redundancy in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods typically operate under an implicit assumption: once a target module is selected, every token passing through it contributes equally to the downstream task and requires a parameter update. In this paper, we challenge this convention and unveil a pervasive token-level redundancy in the fine-tuning of large models. We propose TS-PEFT, a theoretically grounded framework utilizing proximal optimization to dynamically identify and skip redundant token updates during training. Our extensive experiments across Natural Language Understanding, Commonsense Reasoning, and Visual Instruction Tuning demonstrate that indiscriminately updating all tokens is not only computationally superfluous but often introduces optimization noise. Strikingly, by discarding 40%-60% of token updates, TS-PEFT consistently matches or surpasses the performance of dense baselines (e.g., LoRA, DoRA). Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis revealing that the learned token-level sparsity serves as a superior indicator of module importance compared to traditional weight norms, offering a novel data-driven perspective on the intrinsic adaptation mechanism of large models.

Abstract: Pharmaceutical research and development has accumulated vast and heterogeneous archives of data. Much of this knowledge stems from discontinued programs, and reusing these archives is invaluable for reverse translation. However, in practice, such reuse is often infeasible. In this work, we introduce DiscoVerse, a multi-agent co-scientist designed to support pharmaceutical research and development at Roche. Designed as a human-in-the-loop assistant, DiscoVerse enables domain-specific queries by delivering evidence-based answers: it retrieves relevant data, links across documents, summarises key findings and preserves institutional memory. We assess DiscoVerse through expert evaluation of source-linked outputs. Our evaluation spans a selected subset of 180 molecules from Roche's research and development repositories, encompassing over 0.87 billion BPE tokens and more than four decades of research. To our knowledge, this represents the first agentic framework to be systematically assessed on real pharmaceutical data for reverse translation, enabled by authorized access to confidential archives covering the full lifecycle of drug development. Our contributions include: role-specialized agent designs aligned with scientist workflows; human-in-the-loop support for reverse translation; expert evaluation; and a large-scale demonstration showing promising decision-making insights. In brief, across seven benchmark queries, DiscoVerse achieved near-perfect recall ($\geq 0.99$) with moderate precision ($0.71-0.91$). Qualitative assessments and three real-world pharmaceutical use cases further showed faithful, source-linked synthesis across preclinical and clinical evidence.

<title>Representational Stability of Truth in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for factual tasks such as "What treats asthma?" or "What is the capital of Latvia?". However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\leq 8.2\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form. More broadly, our approach provides a diagnostic for auditing and training LLMs to preserve coherent truth assignments under semantic uncertainty, rather than optimizing for output accuracy alone.

Abstract: Measuring biodiversity is crucial for understanding ecosystem health. While prior works have developed machine learning models for taxonomic classification of photographic images and DNA separately, in this work, we introduce a multimodal approach combining both, using CLIP-style contrastive learning to align images, barcode DNA, and text-based representations of taxonomic labels in a unified embedding space. This allows for accurate classification of both known and unknown insect species without task-specific fine-tuning, leveraging contrastive learning for the first time to fuse barcode DNA and image data. Our method surpasses previous single-modality approaches in accuracy by over 8% on zero-shot learning tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in biodiversity studies.

Abstract: Clinical information extraction, which involves structuring clinical concepts from unstructured medical text, remains a challenging problem that could benefit from the inclusion of tabular background information available in electronic health records. Existing open-source datasets lack explicit links between structured features and clinical concepts in the text, motivating the need for a new research dataset. We introduce SimSUM, a benchmark dataset of 10,000 simulated patient records that link unstructured clinical notes with structured background variables. Each record simulates a patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases and includes tabular data (e.g., symptoms, diagnoses, underlying conditions) generated from a Bayesian network whose structure and parameters are defined by domain experts. A large language model (GPT-4o) is prompted to generate a clinical note describing the encounter, including symptoms and relevant context. These notes are annotated with span-level symptom mentions. We conduct an expert evaluation to assess note quality and run baseline predictive models on both the tabular and textual data. The SimSUM dataset is primarily designed to support research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text -- namely, symptoms in the case of SimSUM. Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation. SimSUM is not intended for training clinical decision support systems or production-grade models, but rather to facilitate reproducible research in a simplified and controlled setting.

<title>AEIOU: A Unified Defense Framework against NSFW Prompts in Text-to-Image Models</title>

arXiv:2412.18123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As text-to-image (T2I) models advance and gain widespread adoption, their associated safety concerns are becoming increasingly critical. Malicious users exploit these models to generate Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) images using harmful or adversarial prompts, underscoring the need for effective safeguards to ensure the integrity and compliance of model outputs. However, existing detection methods often exhibit low accuracy and inefficiency. In this paper, we propose AEIOU, a defense framework that is adaptable, efficient, interpretable, optimizable, and unified against NSFW prompts in T2I models. AEIOU extracts NSFW features from the hidden states of the model's text encoder, utilizing the separable nature of these features to detect NSFW prompts. The detection process is efficient, requiring minimal inference time. AEIOU also offers real-time interpretation of results and supports optimization through data augmentation techniques. The framework is versatile, accommodating various T2I architectures. Our extensive experiments show that AEIOU significantly outperforms both commercial and open-source moderation tools, achieving over 95\% accuracy across all datasets and improving efficiency by at least tenfold. It effectively counters adaptive attacks and excels in few-shot and multi-label scenarios.

<title>Make LVLMs Focus: Context-Aware Attention Modulation for Better Multimodal In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) is becoming a key capability that allows large vision-language models (LVLMs) to adapt to novel tasks without parameter updates, which expands their usefulness in many real-world applications. However, ICL performance remains unstable even when the in-context demonstrations (ICDs) are well matched, showing that LVLMs still struggle to make full use of the provided context. While existing work mainly focuses on prompt engineering or post-hoc logit calibration, we study the attention mechanisms inside LVLMs to address their inherent limitations. We identify two important weaknesses in their self-attention that hinder effective ICL. To address these weaknesses, we propose \textbf{Context-Aware Modulated Attention} (CAMA), a training-free and plug-and-play method that dynamically adjusts attention logits based on the input in-context sequence. CAMA uses a two-stage modulation process that strengthens attention to semantically important tokens, especially visual ones. Across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks, CAMA consistently outperforms vanilla models and baselines, showing clear effectiveness and generalization. It can also activate the intended benefits of prompt engineering methods and remains robust across different sequence configurations. Therefore, CAMA opens up new directions for improving multimodal reasoning through a deeper understanding of attention dynamics.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored, despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask, the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-, medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets. Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/EgoMask .

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational deception powered by generative AI.

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge. Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings, we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural language.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with vast context windows offer new avenues for in-context learning (ICL), where providing many examples ("many-shot" prompting) is often assumed to enhance performance. We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/OS-Copilot/OS-Sentinel.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Abstract: We introduce SynBullying, a synthetic multi-LLM conversational dataset for studying and detecting cyberbullying (CB). SynBullying provides a scalable and ethically safe alternative to human data collection by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic bullying interactions. The dataset offers (i) conversational structure, capturing multi-turn exchanges rather than isolated posts; (ii) context-aware annotations, where harmfulness is assessed within the conversational flow considering context, intent, and discourse dynamics; and (iii) fine-grained labeling, covering various CB categories for detailed linguistic and behavioral analysis. We evaluate SynBullying across five dimensions, including conversational structure, lexical patterns, sentiment/toxicity, role dynamics, harm intensity, and CB-type distribution. We further examine its utility by testing its performance as standalone training data and as an augmentation source for CB classification.

<div> Multi-agent systems, large language models, latent collaboration, shared memory, efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper introduces LatentMAS, a novel framework for multi-agent systems (MAS) that enables collaboration among large language model (LLM) agents directly within continuous latent space rather than relying on conventional text-based communication.<br /><br />2. LatentMAS operates without the need for additional training, using each agent's last-layer hidden embeddings to generate auto-regressive latent thoughts, which are shared and preserved in a shared latent working memory for lossless information exchange.<br /><br />3. The authors provide theoretical analysis proving that LatentMAS achieves higher expressiveness and ensures lossless information preservation with significantly lower complexity compared to traditional text-based MAS approaches.<br /><br />4. Empirical evaluation across nine benchmarks related to math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation shows that LatentMAS consistently outperforms baseline models, improving accuracy by up to 14.6%, reducing token usage by 70.8% to 83.7%, and accelerating inference speed by 4 to 4.3 times.<br /><br />5. The presented framework demonstrates substantial improvements in system-level reasoning quality and efficiency, enabling more effective multi-agent coordination with open-sourced code and data available for further research and application. <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) extend large language models (LLMs) from independent single-model reasoning to coordinative system-level intelligence. While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference. These results demonstrate that our new latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without any additional training.

<title>Learn the Ropes, Then Trust the Wins: Self-imitation with Progressive Exploration for Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title>

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, self-imitation learning, exploration-exploitation, large language models, tool use

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) involved in long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks. Traditional methods rely on maximizing policy entropy to stimulate exploration, which can lead to instability due to multi-turn distribution shifts. The authors propose SPEAR, a novel approach based on self-imitation learning (SIL) that gradually steers policy entropy through curriculum scheduling, harmonizing intrinsic reward shaping with self-imitation. This method accelerates exploration by encouraging frequent tool interactions early on and promotes exploitation by reinforcing successful strategies as familiarity with the environment grows. SPEAR is integrated with a strong baseline called Dr.BoT, leveraging standard industrial RL optimization techniques. Experimental results on benchmarks including ALFWorld, WebShop, AIME24, and AIME25 demonstrate significant success rate improvements compared to existing methods (up to 16.1%, 20.7%, and more). These enhancements come with only a modest increase in theoretical complexity (10%-25%) and negligible practical runtime overhead, highlighting SPEAR's scalability and ease of adoption for agentic LLM training. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent's own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL, where a replay buffer stores good experience for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy entropy across stages. Specifically, the proposed curriculum scheduling harmonizes intrinsic reward shaping and self-imitation to 1) expedite exploration via frequent tool interactions at the beginning, and 2) strengthen exploitation of successful tactics upon convergence towards familiarity with the environment. We also combine bag-of-tricks of industrial RL optimizations for a strong baseline Dr.BoT to demonstrate our effectiveness. In ALFWorld and WebShop, SPEAR increases the success rates of GRPO/GiGPO/Dr.BoT by up to 16.1%/5.1%/8.6% and 20.7%/11.8%/13.9%, respectively. In AIME24 and AIME25, SPEAR boosts Dr.BoT by up to 3.8% and 6.1%, respectively. Such gains incur only 10%-25% extra theoretical complexity and negligible runtime overhead in practice, demonstrating the plug-and-play scalability of SPEAR.

<div> Keywords: large language models, code generation, model lifecycle, fine-tuning, autonomous coding agents<br /><br />Summary: This paper provides a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide to large language models (LLMs) for automated code generation, covering the entire model lifecycle from data curation to deployment. It reviews the evolution of code LLMs, highlighting performance improvements from early rule-based methods to Transformer architectures achieving over 95% success on benchmarks like HumanEval. The study systematically examines code capabilities in both general-purpose models (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized models (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, QwenCoder), analyzing their design decisions, techniques, and trade-offs. The authors identify a significant research-practice gap, noting discrepancies between academic benchmarks and real-world software development requirements such as code correctness, security, contextual understanding of large codebases, and integration with development tools. They then map emerging research directions to practical needs, emphasizing the importance of bridging theory and application. Finally, the work presents extensive experiments comparing code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning methods, exploring scaling laws, hyperparameter sensitivity, architectural choices, framework selection, and dataset impacts to guide future development and optimization of code LLMs for industrial use. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed automated software development by enabling direct translation of natural language descriptions into functional code, driving commercial adoption through tools like Github Copilot (Microsoft), Cursor (Anysphere), Trae (ByteDance), and Claude Code (Anthropic). While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Direct Preference Optimization, Empathy, Healthcare Communication, Factual Accuracy<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong generative and reasoning skills but struggle with factual reliability and empathetic communication in healthcare and caregiving contexts.<br />2. These limitations are critical because non-professional users and caregivers rely on accurate medical guidance and emotional support.<br />3. The study introduces a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based alignment framework that enhances factual correctness, semantic coherence, and human-centric qualities like empathy, politeness, and simplicity in dialogues between caregivers and patients.<br />4. The approach fine-tunes domain-adapted LLMs using pairwise preference data, favoring responses that are supportive and accessible rather than prescriptive or overly technical.<br />5. Compared to traditional reinforcement-learning alignment, the DPO method aligns model outputs more efficiently with human preferences.<br />6. Empirical results on multiple open and proprietary LLMs demonstrate that DPO-tuned models outperform baseline and commercial systems (e.g., Google medical dialogue systems) in semantic alignment, factual accuracy, and human-centric metrics.<br />7. The findings support preference-based alignment as a scalable, transparent way to build trustworthy, empathetic, and clinically informed AI assistants for healthcare communication.<br />8. The authors provide open-source code to facilitate further research and application. <div>

Abstract: General-purpose large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative and reasoning capabilities but remain limited in healthcare and caregiving applications due to two key deficiencies: factual unreliability and a lack of empathetic communication. These shortcomings pose significant risks in sensitive contexts where users, particularly non-professionals and caregivers, seek medically relevant guidance or emotional reassurance. To address these challenges, we introduce a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based alignment framework designed to improve factual correctness, semantic coherence, and human-centric qualities such as empathy, politeness, and simplicity in caregiver-patient dialogues. Our approach fine-tunes domain-adapted LLMs using pairwise preference data, where preferred responses reflect supportive and accessible communication styles while rejected ones represent prescriptive or overly technical tones. This direct optimization method aligns model outputs with human preferences more efficiently than traditional reinforcement-learning-based alignment. Empirical evaluations across multiple open and proprietary LLMs show that our DPO-tuned models achieve higher semantic alignment, improved factual accuracy, and stronger human-centric evaluation scores compared to baseline and commercial alternatives such as Google medical dialogue systems. These improvements demonstrate that preference-based alignment offers a scalable and transparent pathway toward developing trustworthy, empathetic, and clinically informed AI assistants for caregiver and healthcare communication.

<title>Morphologically-Informed Tokenizers for Languages with Non-Concatenative Morphology: A case study of Yolox\'ochtil Mixtec ASR</title>

<div> Keywords: Yoloxóchitl Mixtec, morphologically-informed tokenizers, ASR, tonal morphology, word error rate<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper explores the use of morphologically-informed tokenizers to assist and improve the efficiency of interlinear gloss annotation in an audio corpus of Yoloxóchitl Mixtec (YM). The authors introduce two novel tokenization schemes designed to handle non-concatenative, tonal morphology: the Segment and Melody tokenizer, which extracts tones without predicting word segmentation, and the Sequence of Processes tokenizer, which predicts word segmentation and could enable end-to-end ASR systems to output both segmented and unsegmented transcriptions simultaneously. Evaluations show these new tokenizers perform competitively compared to conventional Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and Unigram models. Specifically, the Segment and Melody tokenizer yields better word error rates than traditional tokenizers, although it does not surpass them in character error rate. Furthermore, the study analyzes the tokenizers using morphological and information-theoretic metrics, finding correlations that may predict performance on downstream tasks. The results indicate that nonlinear tokenizers tailored for the unique morphology of the language can be as effective as commonly used tokenizers in ASR systems. However, the paper highlights the need for further research to assess the effectiveness of these tokenizers in other downstream language processing applications. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of using morphologically-informed tokenizers to aid and streamline the interlinear gloss annotation of an audio corpus of Yolox\'ochitl Mixtec (YM) using a combination of ASR and text-based sequence-to-sequence tools, with the goal of improving efficiency while reducing the workload of a human annotator. We present two novel tokenization schemes that separate words in a nonlinear manner, preserving information about tonal morphology as much as possible. One of these approaches, a Segment and Melody tokenizer, simply extracts the tones without predicting segmentation. The other, a Sequence of Processes tokenizer, predicts segmentation for the words, which could allow an end-to-end ASR system to produce segmented and unsegmented transcriptions in a single pass. We find that these novel tokenizers are competitive with BPE and Unigram models, and the Segment-and-Melody model outperforms traditional tokenizers in terms of word error rate but does not reach the same character error rate. In addition, we analyze tokenizers on morphological and information-theoretic metrics to find predictive correlations with downstream performance. Our results suggest that nonlinear tokenizers designed specifically for the non-concatenative morphology of a language are competitive with conventional BPE and Unigram models for ASR. Further research will be necessary to determine the applicability of these tokenizers in downstream processing tasks.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, implicit harm, affective drift, conversational escalation, GAUGE  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used not only as information assistants but also as emotional companions in daily interactions.  
2. Despite lacking explicit toxicity, these models can cause gradual distress due to repeated emotional reinforcement or affective drift, a phenomenon termed "implicit harm."  
3. Current guardrail mechanisms often depend on external classifiers or clinical rubrics, which may not keep pace with the nuanced and real-time emotional dynamics occurring within a conversation.  
4. To address these limitations, the authors introduce GAUGE (Guarding Affective Utterance Generation Escalation), a lightweight framework designed for real-time detection of hidden conversational escalation.  
5. GAUGE operates on a logit-based approach, measuring how an LLM’s output probabilistically shifts the affective state within a dialogue to detect escalation early and mitigate implicit harm effectively. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly integrated into everyday interactions, serving not only as information assistants but also as emotional companions. Even in the absence of explicit toxicity, repeated emotional reinforcement or affective drift can gradually escalate distress in a form of \textit{implicit harm} that traditional toxicity filters fail to detect. Existing guardrail mechanisms often rely on external classifiers or clinical rubrics that may lag behind the nuanced, real-time dynamics of a developing conversation. To address this gap, we propose GAUGE (Guarding Affective Utterance Generation Escalation), a lightweight, logit-based framework for the real-time detection of hidden conversational escalation. GAUGE measures how an LLM's output probabilistically shifts the affective state of a dialogue.

<div> Keywords: LLM-based data enrichment, Confidence-Aware Fine-Grained Debate, mental health analysis, online safety, expert-annotated datasets<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of enriching NLP training datasets with real-world indicators, particularly in domains where labeling is costly and events are dynamic, such as life events for mental health and risky behavior for online safety. The authors propose and compare several large language model (LLM)-based data enrichment methods, introducing a novel Confidence-Aware Fine-Grained Debate (CFD) framework. In the CFD framework, multiple LLM agents act like human annotators, exchanging detailed evidence to collaboratively reach a consensus on annotations. To support evaluation, the paper presents two new expert-annotated datasets: a mental health Reddit wellbeing dataset and an online safety Facebook sharenting risk dataset. Experiments show that the CFD framework consistently outperforms a range of baseline methods, delivering the most robust enrichment results. Incorporating enriched features derived from debate transcripts into NLP models yields significant improvements in downstream tasks. Specifically, for the online safety task, the enriched feature approach improves performance by 10.1% over non-enriched baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of this novel method for data enrichment in complex, real-world NLP tasks. <div>

Abstract: Real-world indicators are important for improving natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as life events for mental health analysis and risky behaviour for online safety, yet labelling such information in NLP training datasets is often costly and/or difficult given the dynamic nature of such events. This paper compares several LLM-based data enrichment methods and introduces a novel Confidence-Aware Fine-Grained Debate (CFD) framework in which multiple LLM agents simulate human annotators and exchange fine-grained evidence to reach consensus. We describe two new expert-annotated datasets, a mental health Reddit wellbeing dataset and an online safety Facebook sharenting risk dataset. Our CFD framework achieves the most robust data enrichment performance compared to a range of baselines and we show that this type of data enrichment consistently improves downstream tasks. Enriched features incorporated via debate transcripts yield the largest gains, outperforming the non-enriched baseline by 10.1% for the online safety task.

<div> Sentence Simplification, Policy-driven Control, Large Language Models, LLM-as-a-Judge, Lexical Simplification<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of sentence simplification, which involves modifying sentences to make them easier to read and understand without changing their original meaning. Different applications require distinct simplification policies, including lexical-level word replacement or rewriting entire sentences while balancing simplicity with detail retention. The authors propose a novel approach that uses Large Language Model-as-a-Judge (LLM-as-a-Judge) to generate training data aligned with specific simplification policies automatically. This method removes the dependency on expensive human annotations or parallel simplification corpora. The approach facilitates creating simplification systems adaptable to various policy requirements. Notably, experiments reveal that smaller open-source LLMs, such as Phi-3-mini-3.8B, outperform GPT-4o in lexical simplification tasks and show comparable results in overall sentence rewriting. These results are confirmed through both automatic evaluation metrics and human assessments. The improvements across different model sizes and families highlight the robustness and general applicability of the proposed method in building flexible and effective sentence simplification models. <div>

Abstract: Sentence simplification aims to modify a sentence to make it easier to read and understand while preserving the meaning. Different applications require distinct simplification policies, such as replacing only complex words at the lexical level or rewriting the entire sentence while trading off details for simplicity. However, achieving such policy-driven control remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful approach that leverages Large Language Model-as-a-Judge (LLM-as-a-Judge) to automatically construct policy-aligned training data, completely removing the need for costly human annotation or parallel corpora. Our method enables building simplification systems that adapt to diverse simplification policies. Remarkably, even small-scale open-source LLMs such as Phi-3-mini-3.8B surpass GPT-4o on lexical-oriented simplification, while achieving comparable performance on overall rewriting, as verified by both automatic metrics and human evaluations. The consistent improvements across model families and sizes demonstrate the robustness of our approach.

Abstract: We present LOCUS (LOw-cost Customization for Universal Specialization), a pipeline that consumes few-shot data to streamline the construction and training of NLP models through targeted retrieval, synthetic data generation, and parameter-efficient tuning. With only a small number of labeled examples, LOCUS discovers pertinent data in a broad repository, synthesizes additional training samples via in-context data generation, and fine-tunes models using either full or low-rank (LoRA) parameter adaptation. Our approach targets named entity recognition (NER) and text classification (TC) benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines (including GPT-4o) while substantially lowering costs and model sizes. Our resultant memory-optimized models retain 99% of fully fine-tuned accuracy while using barely 5% of the memory footprint, also beating GPT-4o on several benchmarks with less than 1% of its parameters.

<title>Convergence of Outputs When Two Large Language Models Interact in a Multi-Agentic Setup</title>

<div> Keywords: multi-agent setup, large language models, conversation convergence, repetition loops, lexical and embedding metrics  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates the interaction dynamics when two large language models (Mistral Nemo Base 2407 and Llama 2 13B hf) engage in a multi-turn conversation without human input, starting from a short seed sentence. Initially, the conversations between the models proceed coherently, but as the dialogue progresses, it frequently falls into repetitive loops where short phrases are repeated across multiple turns. This repetition causes both models to converge in their outputs, producing highly similar or even identical text rather than introducing novel ideas or directions into the conversation. Notably, this convergence and repetition occur despite the models being large, independently trained, and operating without explicit prompt instructions. The study employs lexical and embedding-based metrics to quantitatively analyze how the conversation progressively drifts away from the original seed sentence and how the similarity between the responses of the two models increases over time. The findings highlight a fundamental limitation in multi-agent dialogue setups with large language models, emphasizing a tendency toward convergence and cyclical repetition rather than sustained, diversified interaction. This work provides insights into the dynamics of autonomous multi-model conversations and suggests areas for improving long-term interactive behaviors in AI agents. <div>
arXiv:2512.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report what happens when two large language models respond to each other for many turns without any outside input in a multi-agent setup. The setup begins with a short seed sentence. After that, each model reads the other's output and generates a response. This continues for a fixed number of steps. We used Mistral Nemo Base 2407 and Llama 2 13B hf. We observed that most conversations start coherently but later fall into repetition. In many runs, a short phrase appears and repeats across turns. Once repetition begins, both models tend to produce similar output rather than introducing a new direction in the conversation. This leads to a loop where the same or similar text is produced repeatedly. We describe this behavior as a form of convergence. It occurs even though the models are large, trained separately, and not given any prompt instructions. To study this behavior, we apply lexical and embedding-based metrics to measure how far the conversation drifts from the initial seed and how similar the outputs of the two models becomes as the conversation progresses.

<div> Keywords: Nanbeige4-3B, Fine-Grained Warmup-Stable-Decay, Dual Preference Distillation, instruction finetuning, reinforcement learning<br /><br />Summary: The paper introduces Nanbeige4-3B, a family of small-scale language models that achieve high performance despite their compact size. The models are pretrained on a large corpus of 23 trillion high-quality tokens and subsequently finetuned on over 30 million diverse instructions, pushing the limits of scaling laws for small language models. A novel Fine-Grained Warmup-Stable-Decay (FG-WSD) training scheduler is proposed for pretraining, which dynamically refines data mixtures across stages to enhance training effectiveness. To improve supervised finetuning (SFT) data quality, the authors develop a joint mechanism combining deliberative generation refinement with chain-of-thought reconstruction, delivering noticeable improvements on complex tasks. Additionally, a flagship reasoning model is used to distill Nanbeige4-3B via a Dual Preference Distillation (DPD) method, further boosting performance. The training pipeline concludes with a multi-stage reinforcement learning phase that incorporates verifiable rewards and preference modeling to enhance both reasoning ability and alignment with human preferences. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Nanbeige4-3B outperforms comparable-sized models and competes closely with much larger models across various benchmarks. Model checkpoints are publicly available on Hugging Face for community access. <div>

Abstract: We present Nanbeige4-3B, a family of small-scale but high-performing language models. Pretrained on 23T high-quality tokens and finetuned on over 30 million diverse instructions, we extend the boundary of the scaling law for small language models. In pre-training, we design a Fine-Grained Warmup-Stable-Decay (FG-WSD) training scheduler, which progressively refines data mixtures across stages to boost model performance. In post-training, to improve the quality of the SFT data, we design a joint mechanism that integrates deliberative generation refinement and chain-of-thought reconstruction, yielding substantial gains on complex tasks. Following SFT, we employ our flagship reasoning model to distill Nanbeige4-3B through our proposed Dual Preference Distillation (DPD) method, which leads to further performance gains. Finally, a multi-stage reinforcement learning phase was applied, leveraging verifiable rewards and preference modeling to strengthen abilities on both reasoning and human alignment. Extensive evaluations show that Nanbeige4-3B not only significantly outperforms models of comparable parameter scale but also rivals much larger models across a wide range of benchmarks.

<title>Modeling Contextual Passage Utility for Multihop Question Answering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06464</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06464</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Multihop Question Answering, passage utility, contextual modeling, transformer, reranking<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of Multihop Question Answering (QA), which involves synthesizing information from multiple text passages to answer complex questions.<br />2. Traditional retrieval methods focus on identifying relevant passages but fail to assess their utility, leading to redundant or noisy information that can degrade answer quality.<br />3. The authors note the importance of context-dependent utility, where the usefulness of a passage depends on its relationship with other passages, such as providing complementary information or forming crucial reasoning links.<br />4.

Abstract: Multihop Question Answering (QA) requires systems to identify and synthesize information from multiple text passages. While most prior retrieval methods assist in identifying relevant passages for QA, further assessing the utility of the passages can help in removing redundant ones, which may otherwise add to noise and inaccuracies in the generated answers. Existing utility prediction approaches model passage utility independently, overlooking a critical aspect of multihop reasoning: the utility of a passage can be context-dependent, influenced by its relation to other passages - whether it provides complementary information or forms a crucial link in conjunction with others. In this paper, we propose a lightweight approach to model contextual passage utility, accounting for inter-passage dependencies. We fine-tune a small transformer-based model to predict passage utility scores for multihop QA. We leverage the reasoning traces from an advanced reasoning model to capture the order in which passages are used to answer a question and obtain synthetic training data. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our utility-based scoring of retrieved passages leads to improved reranking and downstream QA performance compared to relevance-based reranking methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: question-answering, sufficiency modeling, reasoning, Identify-then-Verify, multi-hop QA<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of determining if a given context contains enough information to accurately answer a question, a key issue for reliable question-answering (QA) systems.<br />2. While simple prompting methods work well for factual questions, they struggle with inferential questions that require reasoning beyond straightforward text extraction.<br />3. The authors propose an Identify-then-Verify framework that first prompts the model to generate multiple hypotheses about what information might be missing, aiming to create a semantic consensus on the gaps.<br />4. Following this, the model critically verifies these hypotheses by re-examining the source text to confirm whether the identified information is truly absent.<br />5. Evaluation on various multi-hop and factual QA datasets shows that this approach improves the accuracy of sufficiency judgments and helps the model clearly articulate specific information gaps, leading to more robust and interpretable QA performance. <div>

Abstract: Determining whether a provided context contains sufficient information to answer a question is a critical challenge for building reliable question-answering systems. While simple prompting strategies have shown success on factual questions, they frequently fail on inferential ones that require reasoning beyond direct text extraction. We hypothesize that asking a model to first reason about what specific information is missing provides a more reliable, implicit signal for assessing overall sufficiency. To this end, we propose a structured Identify-then-Verify framework for robust sufficiency modeling. Our method first generates multiple hypotheses about missing information and establishes a semantic consensus. It then performs a critical verification step, forcing the model to re-examine the source text to confirm whether this information is truly absent. We evaluate our method against established baselines across diverse multi-hop and factual QA datasets. The results demonstrate that by guiding the model to justify its claims about missing information, our framework produces more accurate sufficiency judgments while clearly articulating any information gaps.

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the automatic classification of German language proficiency according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), a crucial task for personalized education. To achieve this, the authors create a comprehensive dataset by merging various existing CEFR-annotated corpora with synthetic data, ensuring diverse and robust training and evaluation material.

Abstract: Assessing language proficiency is essential for education, as it enables instruction tailored to learners needs. This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically classifying German texts according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) into different proficiency levels. To support robust training and evaluation, we construct a diverse dataset by combining multiple existing CEFR-annotated corpora with synthetic data. We then evaluate prompt-engineering strategies, fine-tuning of a LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model and a probing-based approach that utilizes the internal neural state of the LLM for classification. Our results show a consistent performance improvement over prior methods, highlighting the potential of LLMs for reliable and scalable CEFR classification.

<div> Keywords: language model safety, prosocial alignment, harm mitigation, constrained generation, preference-aware reward modeling<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses limitations in current language model safety techniques, especially in emotionally charged or high-stakes scenarios where simple refusal or naive compliance can be counterproductive.<br /><br />2. It introduces ProSocialAlign, a test-time, parameter-efficient framework that guides the generation of responses to be safe, empathetic, and aligned with human values without the need to retrain the underlying base model.<br /><br />3. The approach formalizes five human-centered objectives and models safety as a lexicographic constrained generation problem, where hard constraints first remove harmful continuations before optimizing prosocial qualities within the safe candidate set.<br /><br />4. ProSocialAlign incorporates two key mechanisms: directional regulation, which mitigates harm by subtracting a learned "harm vector" in model parameter space, and preference-aware autoregressive reward modeling trained jointly across multiple attributes with gradient conflict resolution, allowing fine-grained, user-controllable decoding.<br /><br />5. Extensive empirical evaluation on five safety benchmarks shows that ProSocialAlign achieves state-of-the-art performance by significantly reducing unsafe content leakage and enhancing alignment with human values, offering a modular and robust foundation for generating context-sensitive and safe responses at inference time. <div>

Abstract: Current language model safety paradigms often fall short in emotionally charged or high-stakes settings, where refusal-only approaches may alienate users and naive compliance can amplify risk. We propose ProSocialAlign, a test-time, parameter-efficient framework that steers generation toward safe, empathetic, and value-aligned responses without retraining the base model. We formalize five human-centered objectives and cast safety as lexicographic constrained generation: first, applying hard constraints to eliminate harmful continuations; then optimizing for prosocial quality within the safe set. Our method combines (i) directional regulation, a harm-mitigation mechanism that subtracts a learned "harm vector" in parameter space, and (ii) preference-aware autoregressive reward modeling trained jointly across attributes with gradient conflict resolution, enabling fine-grained, user-controllable decoding. Empirical evaluations across five safety benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing unsafe leakage and boosting alignment to human values, with strong gains across multiple evaluation metrics. ProSocialAlign offers a robust and modular foundation for generating context-sensitive, safe, and human-aligned responses at inference time.

<div> Keywords: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis, Cross-Modal Fusion, Abstract Meaning Representations, Multi-view Contrastive Learning, Hierarchical Gated Attention  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the limitations of current Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) systems that typically operate on isolated linguistic perspectives, missing the complex interactions among various syntactic and semantic structures involved in human language understanding. To overcome this, the authors propose CMV-Fuse, a novel Cross-Modal View fusion framework designed to integrate four complementary linguistic views: Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR), constituency parsing, dependency syntax, and semantic attention, further enhanced by external knowledge integration. CMV-Fuse employs a hierarchical gated attention mechanism to fuse information across local syntactic structures, intermediate semantic representations, and global world knowledge levels, thereby capturing fine-grained structural details and broad contextual insights. A key innovation is the structure-aware multi-view contrastive learning strategy, which enforces consistency across these multiple linguistic views while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is extensively evaluated on standard ABSA benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over strong baseline models. The analysis further reveals the individual and combined contributions of each linguistic perspective, highlighting the robustness and effectiveness of the CMV-Fuse approach for improved sentiment analysis. <div>

Abstract: Natural language understanding inherently depends on integrating multiple complementary perspectives spanning from surface syntax to deep semantics and world knowledge. However, current Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) systems typically exploit isolated linguistic views, thereby overlooking the intricate interplay between structural representations that humans naturally leverage. We propose CMV-Fuse, a Cross-Modal View fusion framework that emulates human language processing by systematically combining multiple linguistic perspectives. Our approach systematically orchestrates four linguistic perspectives: Abstract Meaning Representations, constituency parsing, dependency syntax, and semantic attention, enhanced with external knowledge integration. Through hierarchical gated attention fusion across local syntactic, intermediate semantic, and global knowledge levels, CMV-Fuse captures both fine-grained structural patterns and broad contextual understanding. A novel structure aware multi-view contrastive learning mechanism ensures consistency across complementary representations while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over strong baselines on standard benchmarks, with analysis revealing how each linguistic view contributes to more robust sentiment analysis.

<div> Keywords: mechanistic interpretability, GPT-2, sentiment analysis, activation patching, contextual integration  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study investigates how GPT-2 processes sentiment information across its transformer layers using mechanistic interpretability techniques. The researchers employ systematic activation patching across all 12 model layers to explore the proposed two-stage sentiment processing architecture, which suggests early lexical detection and mid-layer contextual integration. Their experiments confirm that early layers (0-3) function as lexical sentiment detectors, encoding stable and position-specific polarity signals that largely ignore context, supporting the first stage of the hypothesis. However, the study falsifies all three proposed hypotheses about mid-layer contextual integration — Middle Layer Concentration, Phenomenon Specificity, and Distributed Processing — showing no evidence of specialized mid-layer sentiment processing. Instead, the contextual integration of phenomena such as negation, sarcasm, and domain shifts primarily occurs in the late layers (8-11) through a unified, non-modular mechanism. These results reveal that GPT-2’s sentiment computation deviates from the expected hierarchical pattern of processing, suggesting that contextual sentiment understanding is consolidated later in the network. The findings emphasize the importance of further empirical studies to accurately characterize how large language models integrate contextual cues during sentiment analysis. <div>

Abstract: We present a mechanistic interpretability study of GPT-2 that causally examines how sentiment information is processed across its transformer layers. Using systematic activation patching across all 12 layers, we test the hypothesized two-stage sentiment architecture comprising early lexical detection and mid-layer contextual integration. Our experiments confirm that early layers (0-3) act as lexical sentiment detectors, encoding stable, position specific polarity signals that are largely independent of context. However, all three contextual integration hypotheses: Middle Layer Concentration, Phenomenon Specificity, and Distributed Processing are falsified. Instead of mid-layer specialization, we find that contextual phenomena such as negation, sarcasm, domain shifts etc. are integrated primarily in late layers (8-11) through a unified, non-modular mechanism. These experimental findings provide causal evidence that GPT-2's sentiment computation differs from the predicted hierarchical pattern, highlighting the need for further empirical characterization of contextual integration in large language models.

<div> Keywords: Personalization, large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning, agentic memory, long-context reasoning<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces PersonaMem-v2, an advanced dataset designed for personalization in large language models (LLMs). It simulates 1,000 realistic user-chatbot interactions across over 300 scenarios, incorporating 20,000+ user preferences and supporting long-context windows up to 128k tokens. Most user preferences are implicitly revealed to closely mirror real-world interaction dynamics. The study explores how reinforcement fine-tuning improves models’ long-context reasoning abilities, crucial for understanding and personalizing user experiences. Additionally, the authors propose an agentic memory system framework that maintains a human-readable memory for each user, which expands over time. Experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with implicit personalization, achieving only 37-48% accuracy despite supporting long contexts. By applying reinforcement fine-tuning, Qwen3-4B surpasses GPT-5, reaching 53% accuracy on implicit personalization tasks. The agentic memory framework further advances performance to 55% accuracy while drastically reducing the token input size by 16 times, using only a 2k-token memory instead of full 32k-token conversation histories. These results emphasize the value of the PersonaMem-v2 dataset and demonstrate that agentic memory offers a scalable approach toward achieving real-world personalized AI capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Personalization is one of the next milestones in advancing AI capability and alignment. We introduce PersonaMem-v2, the state-of-the-art dataset for LLM personalization that simulates 1,000 realistic user-chatbot interactions on 300+ scenarios, 20,000+ user preferences, and 128k-token context windows, where most user preferences are implicitly revealed to reflect real-world interactions. Using this data, we investigate how reinforcement fine-tuning enables a model to improve its long-context reasoning capabilities for user understanding and personalization. We also develop a framework for training an agentic memory system, which maintains a single, human-readable memory that grows with each user over time.
  In our experiments, frontier LLMs still struggle with implicit personalization, achieving only 37-48% accuracy. While they support long context windows, reasoning remains the bottleneck for implicit personalization tasks. Using reinforcement fine-tuning, we successfully train Qwen3-4B to outperforms GPT-5, reaching 53% accuracy in implicit personalization. Moreover, our agentic memory framework achieves state-of-the-art 55% accuracy while using 16x fewer input tokens, relying on a 2k-token memory instead of full 32k conversation histories. These results underscore the impact of our dataset and demonstrate agentic memory as a scalable path toward real-world personalized intelligence.

<div> Preference Alignment, Personalization, Long-Form Generation, Think-While-Generating, Training Efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the limitation of existing large language model (LLM) methods which optimize for population-level preferences but fail to capture individual user preferences, crucial for true personalization.<br />2. Early personalization methods like prompt customization or fine-tuning struggle to reason over implicit user preferences, hence are less effective in real-world applications.<br />3. Recent "think-then-generate" methods improve reasoning by performing it before response generation but encounter difficulties in long-form generation due to static one-shot reasoning that must encompass all relevant information at once, leading to learning challenges and poor adaptability.<br />4. The authors propose FlyThinker, a novel framework that implements a "think-while-generating" approach by using a separate reasoning model to create latent token-level reasoning in parallel with generation, which is dynamically fused into the generation process.<br />5. FlyThinker's reasoning model depends only on previous response tokens (not its own prior outputs), enabling parallel training akin to standard LLM training for efficiency, and allowing reasoning and generation to run concurrently during inference.<br />6. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show FlyThinker improves personalized long-form generation while maintaining both training and inference efficiency. <div>

Abstract: Preference alignment has enabled large language models (LLMs) to better reflect human expectations, but current methods mostly optimize for population-level preferences, overlooking individual users. Personalization is essential, yet early approaches-such as prompt customization or fine-tuning-struggle to reason over implicit preferences, limiting real-world effectiveness. Recent "think-then-generate" methods address this by reasoning before response generation. However, they face challenges in long-form generation: their static one-shot reasoning must capture all relevant information for the full response generation, making learning difficult and limiting adaptability to evolving content. To address this issue, we propose FlyThinker, an efficient "think-while-generating" framework for personalized long-form generation. FlyThinker employs a separate reasoning model that generates latent token-level reasoning in parallel, which is fused into the generation model to dynamically guide response generation. This design enables reasoning and generation to run concurrently, ensuring inference efficiency. In addition, the reasoning model is designed to depend only on previous responses rather than its own prior outputs, which preserves training parallelism across different positions-allowing all reasoning tokens for training data to be produced in a single forward pass like standard LLM training, ensuring training efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that FlyThinker achieves better personalized generation while keeping training and inference efficiency.

<div> Keywords: Topic modeling, social media, Sentence-BERT, Gaussian Mixture Models, dimensionality reduction  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The rapid growth of social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Reddit has created opportunities for large-scale text analysis across various domains, including social issues and consumer sentiment. Traditional topic modeling methods, tailored for longer and more formal documents, often perform poorly on short social media posts due to limited co-occurrence data, inconsistent language use, and fragmented semantics. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose TopiCLEAR, a novel topic extraction method that combines embeddings generated by Sentence-BERT with clustering via Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). TopiCLEAR iteratively refines clusters through supervised projection using linear discriminant analysis followed by GMM clustering until convergence, enabling adaptive dimensionality reduction. Importantly, the method bypasses preprocessing steps such as stop word removal, working directly on raw textual input. The approach is evaluated on four datasets: 20News, AgNewsTitle, Reddit, and TweetTopic, all containing human-labeled topic annotations. Compared to seven baseline methods—including a recent SBERT-based model and a zero-shot generative AI technique—TopiCLEAR achieves the highest correspondence with human-annotated topics, showing notable improvements for both social media posts and online news. Qualitative analysis confirms that TopiCLEAR generates more interpretable topics, indicating its potential for enhanced social media and web content analytics. <div>

Abstract: Rapid expansion of social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Reddit has enabled large-scale analysis of public perceptions on diverse topics, including social issues, politics, natural disasters, and consumer sentiment. Topic modeling is a widely used approach for uncovering latent themes in text data, typically framed as an unsupervised classification task. However, traditional models, originally designed for longer and more formal documents, struggle with short social media posts due to limited co-occurrence statistics, fragmented semantics, inconsistent spelling, and informal language. To address these challenges, we propose a new method, TopiCLEAR: Topic extraction by CLustering Embeddings with Adaptive dimensional Reduction. Specifically, each text is embedded using Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and provisionally clustered using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The clusters are then refined iteratively using a supervised projection based on linear discriminant analysis, followed by GMM-based clustering until convergence. Notably, our method operates directly on raw text, eliminating the need for preprocessing steps such as stop word removal. We evaluate our approach on four diverse datasets, 20News, AgNewsTitle, Reddit, and TweetTopic, each containing human-labeled topic information. Compared with seven baseline methods, including a recent SBERT-based method and a zero-shot generative AI method, our approach achieves the highest similarity to human-annotated topics, with significant improvements for both social media posts and online news articles. Additionally, qualitative analysis shows that our method produces more interpretable topics, highlighting its potential for applications in social media data and web content analytics.

<div> Keywords: privacy protection, differential privacy, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, gradient clipping, language models<br /><br />Summary: This study presents a novel method to enhance privacy protection and efficiency in instruction fine-tuning of large-scale language models by combining differential privacy noise allocation with gradient clipping within a collaborative optimization framework. The approach keeps the backbone model frozen and updates only a low-dimensional projection subspace, significantly reducing the number of parameters that require tuning. By introducing adaptive noise allocation and clipping techniques during gradient computation, the method better manages the privacy budget and maintains stability and robustness in training. The unified framework effectively integrates gradient constraints, noise allocation, and parameter projection to minimize performance fluctuations and privacy vulnerabilities, especially in multi-task instruction scenarios. Extensive experiments evaluate the method across various hyperparameter settings, environments, and data sensitivity levels, demonstrating consistent improvements over baseline models in accuracy, privacy budget efficiency, and parameter usage. The approach also sustains stable performance despite uncertainties and variability in the training data. The work advances the theoretical integration of differential privacy with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and offers practical adaptability for secure and efficient training of language models in complex instruction-driven tasks. This provides a promising and feasible solution for privacy-preserving training in challenging multi-task environments. <div>

<div> Implicit Bias, Large Language Models, Fairness Evaluation, ImplicitBBQ, GPT-4o<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Existing benchmarks for evaluating biases in large language models (LLMs) typically depend on explicit identification of protected attributes such as religion, race, or gender. 2. These explicit methods overlook implicit biases that emerge through subtle cues such as names and cultural traits commonly seen in real-world interactions. 3. To address this gap, the authors introduce ImplicitBBQ, a new benchmark that extends the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) by incorporating implicitly cued protected attributes across six categories. 4. The evaluation of GPT-4o using ImplicitBBQ reveals significant disparities in model performance, with accuracy dropping as much as 7% in the "sexual orientation" subcategory and showing consistent declines in most other categories compared to explicit BBQ prompts. 5. These results uncover the presence of implicit biases in current LLMs that remain undetected by conventional explicit bias benchmarks, emphasizing the importance of ImplicitBBQ as a tool for more nuanced and comprehensive fairness evaluation in natural language processing (NLP). <div>

Abstract: Existing benchmarks evaluating biases in large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on explicit cues, declaring protected attributes like religion, race, gender by name. However, real-world interactions often contain implicit biases, inferred subtly through names, cultural cues, or traits. This critical oversight creates a significant blind spot in fairness evaluation. We introduce ImplicitBBQ, a benchmark extending the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) with implicitly cued protected attributes across 6 categories. Our evaluation of GPT-4o on ImplicitBBQ illustrates troubling performance disparity from explicit BBQ prompts, with accuracy declining up to 7% in the "sexual orientation" subcategory and consistent decline located across most other categories. This indicates that current LLMs contain implicit biases undetected by explicit benchmarks. ImplicitBBQ offers a crucial tool for nuanced fairness evaluation in NLP.

<div> Transfer Learning, Large Language Models, Low-resource languages, Medical NLP, Model Distillation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenges of deploying large language models (LLMs) in resource-limited healthcare settings, focusing on aiding visually impaired users and Hindi speakers in rural areas. The authors introduce PDFTEMRA, a compact transformer-based model designed to be computationally efficient while maintaining strong language understanding capabilities. PDFTEMRA achieves this efficiency by integrating model distillation, frequency-domain modulation, ensemble learning, and randomized activation patterns. The model is specifically trained and evaluated on medical question-answering and consultation datasets relevant to Hindi language and accessibility needs. Comparative experiments with current state-of-the-art NLP models demonstrate that PDFTEMRA delivers comparable performance levels but with significantly reduced computational costs. This makes it a suitable solution for accessible and inclusive medical NLP applications in low-resource environments, providing necessary support where large-scale models are impractical. The study highlights the potential of model compression and architectural innovations to broaden the usability of advanced language models in real-world, under-resourced healthcare contexts. <div>

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) has accelerated the rapid development and availability of large language models (LLMs) for mainstream natural language processing (NLP) use cases. However, training and deploying such gigantic LLMs in resource-constrained, real-world healthcare situations remains challenging. This study addresses the limited support available to visually impaired users and speakers of low-resource languages such as Hindi who require medical assistance in rural environments. We propose PDFTEMRA (Performant Distilled Frequency Transformer Ensemble Model with Random Activations), a compact transformer-based architecture that integrates model distillation, frequency-domain modulation, ensemble learning, and randomized activation patterns to reduce computational cost while preserving language understanding performance. The model is trained and evaluated on medical question-answering and consultation datasets tailored to Hindi and accessibility scenarios, and its performance is compared against standard NLP state-of-the-art model baselines. Results demonstrate that PDFTEMRA achieves comparable performance with substantially lower computational requirements, indicating its suitability for accessible, inclusive, low-resource medical NLP applications.

<div> Keywords: text embedding models, word similarity, semantic prompts, zero-shot technique, benchmarks<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Text embedding models are primarily designed and evaluated for sentence-level tasks such as retrieval and semantic similarity, with less understanding of their performance on isolated words.<br />2. The study demonstrates that prepending semantic prompts to individual words before embedding significantly enhances word similarity correlations.<br />3. Seven state-of-the-art text embedding models including OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-large, Cohere’s embed-english-v3.0, and others were tested on three standard word similarity benchmarks: SimLex-999, WordSim-353, and MEN-3000.<br />4. Semantic prompts like "meaning: {word}" or "Represent the semantic concept: {word}" improve Spearman correlation scores by up to +0.29 on SimLex-999, rescuing models that otherwise show zero correlation on bare words.<br />5. The best performing models in zero-shot settings achieved correlations of 0.692 (Cohere) on SimLex-999, 0.811 on WordSim-353, and 0.855 on MEN-3000 (OpenAI), surpassing classic static embeddings like Word2Vec and LexVec.<br />6. This zero-shot prompting technique requires no additional training and is model-agnostic, establishing a new state-of-the-art for word-level embedding quality using pure embedding methods. <div>

Abstract: Text embedding models are designed for sentence-level applications like retrieval and semantic similarity, and are primarily evaluated on sentence-level benchmarks. Their behavior on isolated words is less understood. We show that simply prepending semantic prompts to words before embedding substantially improves word similarity correlations. Testing 7 text embedding models, including text-embedding-3-large (OpenAI), embed-english-v3.0 (Cohere), voyage-3(Voyage AI), all-mpnet-base-v2, and Qwen3-Embedding-8B, on 3 standard benchmarks (SimLex-999, WordSim-353, MEN-3000), we find that prompts like "meaning: {word}" or "Represent the semantic concept: {word}" improve Spearman correlations by up to +0.29 on SimLex-999. Some models fail completely on bare words (correlation = 0) but recover with prompts (+0.73 improvement). Our best results achieve correlation = 0.692 on SimLex-999 with embed-english-v3.0 (Cohere), correlation = 0.811 on WordSim-353, and correlation = 0.855 on MEN-3000 with text-embedding-3-large (OpenAI). These results outperform classic static embeddings like Word2Vec (correlation = 0.40) and even the best static method LexVec (correlation = 0.48) on SimLex-999, establishing a new state-of-the-art for pure embedding methods. This zero-shot technique requires no training and works with any text embedding model.

<div> LLM evaluation, meta-prompt, sequential learning, selective update, self-consistency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Automatic evaluation using large language models (LLMs), often called LLM-as-a-judge, is widespread for assessing reasoning and alignment tasks. However, conventional evaluators treat each sample independently and use a fixed prompt, missing opportunities to improve from experience and tailor evaluations to specific cases. To address this, the study introduces Learning While Evaluating (LWE), a novel framework enabling evaluators to improve sequentially at inference without needing separate training or validation datasets. LWE uses an evolving meta-prompt that generates sample-specific evaluation instructions and self-refines based on feedback generated during the evaluation process. Building upon this, Selective LWE further optimizes resource use by updating the meta-prompt only when cases show self-inconsistencies, allowing focused improvements on challenging samples. This selective strategy preserves the benefits of continual learning while reducing computational cost. Experimental results on two pairwise comparison benchmarks show that Selective LWE surpasses strong baseline evaluators, proving that evaluators can learn effectively during sequential testing by concentrating on cases that pose the greatest difficulty, thereby improving evaluation quality in an efficient manner. <div>

Abstract: Automatic evaluation with large language models, commonly known as LLM-as-a-judge, is now standard across reasoning and alignment tasks. Despite evaluating many samples in deployment, these evaluators typically (i) treat each case independently, missing the opportunity to accumulate experience, and (ii) rely on a single fixed prompt for all cases, neglecting the need for sample-specific evaluation criteria. We introduce Learning While Evaluating (LWE), a framework that allows evaluators to improve sequentially at inference time without requiring training or validation sets. LWE maintains an evolving meta-prompt that (i) produces sample-specific evaluation instructions and (ii) refines itself through self-generated feedback. Furthermore, we propose Selective LWE, which updates the meta-prompt only on self-inconsistent cases, focusing computation where it matters most. This selective approach retains the benefits of sequential learning while being far more cost-effective. Across two pairwise comparison benchmarks, Selective LWE outperforms strong baselines, empirically demonstrating that evaluators can improve during sequential testing with a simple selective update, learning most from the cases they struggle with.

<title>From Next-Token to Next-Block: A Principled Adaptation Path for Diffusion LLMs</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Diffusion Language Models, Autoregressive Decoding, Block-wise Diffusion, Adaptation

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the throughput bottleneck in large language models (LLMs) caused by inherently sequential autoregressive (AR) decoding. It focuses on Diffusion Language Models (DLMs), particularly block-wise variants, which enable parallel generation and bidirectional reasoning within blocks but are costly to train from scratch and discard knowledge from pretrained AR checkpoints. Previous adaptation approaches have limitations, such as modifying logits or attention masks without resolving the fundamental mismatch between AR causality and block-wise bidirectionality. The authors propose reframing adaptation as a pathway from AR to block-diffusion by treating AR as block-diffusion with block size one. Their method involves using a context-causal attention mask (causal across context but bidirectional inside active blocks), an efficient parallel adaptation procedure, an auxiliary AR loss to retain pretrained knowledge and maximize data use, and a gradual increase of block size during generation. This approach integrates seamlessly with masked block-diffusion while maintaining training-inference consistency. The resulting model, NBDiff-7B (both Base and Instruct versions), preserves long-context modeling and reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results among 7B-parameter class DLMs on various benchmarks including general knowledge, math, and code. Overall, principled AR-to-block-diffusion adaptation is shown to be a compute-efficient and effective alternative to training large DLMs from scratch. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generation but dominant autoregressive (AR) decoding is inherently sequential, creating a throughput bottleneck. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs)--especially block-wise variants--enable parallel generation and intra-block bidirectional reasoning, yet training large DLMs from scratch is costly and wastes the knowledge in mature AR checkpoints. Prior "adaptation" attempts either modify logits or randomly grow attention masks to full-sequence diffusion, or simply transplant AR weights into a block-diffusion recipe, leaving a fundamental mismatch between AR causality and block-wise bidirectionality unaddressed. We reframe adaptation as a intra-paradigm path from AR to Block-Diffusion by viewing AR as Block-Diffusion with blocksize=1. Concretely, we design the pathway of adaptation as follows: we use a context-causal attention mask (causal in context, bidirectional only within the active block), an efficient parallel adaptation procedure, an auxiliary AR loss to maximize data utilization and retain pretrained knowledge, and gradual increment of the generation block size. The recipe integrates cleanly with masked block-diffusion and maintains train-inference consistency. Built on these components, NBDiff-7B (Base and Instruct) could inherit the long-context modeling and reasoning capabilities, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among the 7B-class DLMs, delivering strong gains on general-knowledge, math, and code benchmarks over strong baselines. These results demonstrate that principled AR-to-block-diffusion adaptation is an effective and compute-efficient alternative to training DLMs from scratch.

<title>LLM4SFC: Sequential Function Chart Generation via Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06787</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06787</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Sequential Function Charts, PLC programming, structured generation, industrial automation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of generating executable Sequential Function Charts (SFCs), a graphical programming language under IEC 61131-3, which is less explored compared to textual PLC languages like Structured Text (ST).<br /><br />2. SFC generation is difficult because it involves both graphical topology and embedded ST actions, which do not easily conform to standard text generation techniques, often resulting in non-executable code incompatible with industrial tools.<br /><br />3. To overcome these issues, the authors propose LLM4SFC, a novel framework that takes natural language descriptions of industrial workflows and outputs executable SFC programs.<br /><br />4. LLM4SFC relies on three main components: (i) a reduced structured representation that simplifies the graphical topology and embedded ST while minimizing verbosity; (ii) fine-tuning combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to align with SFC programming conventions; and (iii) a structured generation method that prunes illegal tokens in real-time, ensuring output compliance with SFC textual format.<br /><br />5. The framework is evaluated on a real-world dataset of SFCs from automated manufacturing projects using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, achieving a syntactic generation success rate between 75% and 94%, demonstrating its effectiveness in bridging graphical and textual PLC programming and advancing automated industrial programming. <div>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for synthesizing textual PLC programming languages like Structured Text (ST) code, other IEC 61131-3 standard graphical languages like Sequential Function Charts (SFCs) remain underexplored. Generating SFCs is challenging due to graphical nature and ST actions embedded within, which are not directly compatible with standard generation techniques, often leading to non-executable code that is incompatible with industrial tool-chains In this work, we introduce LLM4SFC, the first framework to receive natural-language descriptions of industrial workflows and provide executable SFCs. LLM4SFC is based on three components: (i) A reduced structured representation that captures essential topology and in-line ST and reduced textual verbosity; (ii) Fine-tuning and few-shot retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for alignment with SFC programming conventions; and (iii) A structured generation approach that prunes illegal tokens in real-time to ensure compliance with the textual format of SFCs. We evaluate LLM4SFC on a dataset of real-world SFCs from automated manufacturing projects, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs. The results show that LLM4SFC reliably generates syntactically valid SFC programs effectively bridging graphical and textual PLC languages, achieving a generation generation success of 75% - 94%, paving the way for automated industrial programming.

<div> Keywords: Discharge Summaries, Large Language Models, MIMIC-III, hallucinations, proprietary models  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Discharge summaries are essential medical documents that encapsulate a patient’s visit details and play a critical role in ongoing patient care. Automating their creation has the potential to reduce healthcare professionals' workload, minimize errors, and improve accessibility to vital patient information. This study evaluates the performance of five Large Language Models (LLMs) — including open-source models like Mistral and Llama 2, and proprietary models such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and Gemini 1.5 Pro — on generating discharge summaries using the MIMIC-III dataset. The models were assessed through exact-match, soft-overlap, and reference-free metrics to gauge summary quality. Results indicated that proprietary models, particularly Gemini with one-shot prompting, outperformed the open-source alternatives by producing summaries closely aligned with gold-standard notes. Open-source models showed potential after fine-tuning, especially Mistral, but faced challenges such as hallucinations and repetitive content. A clinical expert’s human evaluation affirmed the practical usefulness of summaries generated by proprietary models. The study acknowledges ongoing challenges in hallucination and missing information but concludes that Large Language Models, especially proprietary ones, hold promise for automating discharge summary generation, provided data privacy concerns are effectively addressed. <div>

Abstract: Discharge Summaries are documents written by medical professionals that detail a patient's visit to a care facility. They contain a wealth of information crucial for patient care, and automating their generation could significantly reduce the effort required from healthcare professionals, minimize errors, and ensure that critical patient information is easily accessible and actionable. In this work, we explore the use of five Large Language Models on this task, from open-source models (Mistral, Llama 2) to proprietary systems (GPT-3, GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro), leveraging MIMIC-III summaries and notes. We evaluate them using exact-match, soft-overlap, and reference-free metrics. Our results show that proprietary models, particularly Gemini with one-shot prompting, outperformed others, producing summaries with the highest similarity to the gold-standard ones. Open-source models, while promising, especially Mistral after fine-tuning, lagged in performance, often struggling with hallucinations and repeated information. Human evaluation by a clinical expert confirmed the practical utility of the summaries generated by proprietary models. Despite the challenges, such as hallucinations and missing information, the findings suggest that LLMs, especially proprietary models, are promising candidates for automatic discharge summary generation as long as data privacy is ensured.

<div> Keywords: multimodal classifiers, natural language explanations, faithfulness, causal abstraction, CAuSE<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. The paper addresses the interpretability of multimodal classifiers, which are typically opaque black-box models, by focusing on generating intuitive and accessible natural language explanations (NLEs).<br />2. It highlights the importance of faithfulness in explanations, meaning they must accurately reflect the internal decision-making of the classifier to build user trust.<br />3. The authors propose CAuSE (Causal Abstraction under Simulated Explanations), a novel framework designed to produce faithful NLEs for any pretrained multimodal classifier.<br />4. CAuSE is trained using interchange intervention, theoretically forming a causal abstraction of the classifier’s internal mechanism.<br />5. The framework is empirically validated across various datasets and models, showing superior performance in generating faithful explanations.<br />6. A new metric specifically for measuring causal faithfulness in multimodal settings is introduced to evaluate CAuSE and related methods.<br />7. Qualitative analysis and detailed error investigation further support the framework’s advantages as well as uncover cases where it can fail.<br />8. To support replicability and further research, the authors have made the source code available publicly at their GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal classifiers function as opaque black box models. While several techniques exist to interpret their predictions, very few of them are as intuitive and accessible as natural language explanations (NLEs). To build trust, such explanations must faithfully capture the classifier's internal decision making behavior, a property known as faithfulness. In this paper, we propose CAuSE (Causal Abstraction under Simulated Explanations), a novel framework to generate faithful NLEs for any pretrained multimodal classifier. We demonstrate that CAuSE generalizes across datasets and models through extensive empirical evaluations. Theoretically, we show that CAuSE, trained via interchange intervention, forms a causal abstraction of the underlying classifier. We further validate this through a redesigned metric for measuring causal faithfulness in multimodal settings. CAuSE surpasses other methods on this metric, with qualitative analysis reinforcing its advantages. We perform detailed error analysis to pinpoint the failure cases of CAuSE. For replicability, we make the codes available at https://github.com/newcodevelop/CAuSE

<div> Microbial contamination, drinking water systems, cross-modal framework, microscopic imaging, water quality prediction<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study addresses the challenge of monitoring microbial contamination in small-scale drinking water systems where contamination levels fluctuate rapidly. Traditional monitoring tools fall short as they analyze microscopic imaging and physicochemical sensor data separately, limiting real-time decision-making reliability. AquaFusionNet is introduced as a lightweight, edge-deployable cross-modal framework that integrates microscopic organism-level data with short-term water chemistry sensor readings into a single model. Unlike previous methods treating detection and prediction independently, AquaFusionNet learns the dependencies between microbial appearances and sensor dynamics using a gated cross-attention mechanism optimized for low-power hardware. The model is trained on AquaMicro12K, a newly curated dataset of 12,846 annotated microscopic images relevant to drinking water monitoring—a rare public resource in this domain. Deployed over six months in seven facilities in East Java, Indonesia, the system processed 1.84 million frames, achieving a 94.8% mean average precision (mAP@0.5) for contamination detection and 96.3% accuracy in anomaly prediction while consuming only 4.8 W on a Jetson Nano device. Compared to existing lightweight detectors, AquaFusionNet delivers higher accuracy at similar or lower power usage. Field tests confirm that combining data modalities reduces errors common in single-sensor systems, especially under challenging conditions like fouling, turbidity, and uneven lighting. All models, datasets, and hardware designs are openly released to support replication and adoption in decentralized water safety efforts. <div>
arXiv:2512.06848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence from many low and middle income regions shows that microbial contamination in small scale drinking water systems often fluctuates rapidly, yet existing monitoring tools capture only fragments of this behaviour. Microscopic imaging provides organism level visibility, whereas physicochemical sensors reveal shortterm changes in water chemistry; in practice, operators must interpret these streams separately, making realtime decision-making unreliable. This study introduces AquaFusionNet, a lightweight cross-modal framework that unifies both information sources inside a single edge deployable model. Unlike prior work that treats microscopic detection and water quality prediction as independent tasks, AquaFusionNet learns the statistical dependencies between microbial appearance and concurrent sensor dynamics through a gated crossattention mechanism designed specifically for lowpower hardware. The framework is trained on AquaMicro12K, a new dataset comprising 12,846 annotated 1000 micrographs curated for drinking water contexts, an area where publicly accessible microscopic datasets are scarce. Deployed for six months across seven facilities in East Java, Indonesia, the system processed 1.84 million frames and consistently detected contamination events with 94.8% mAP@0.5 and 96.3% anomaly prediction accuracy, while operating at 4.8 W on a Jetson Nano. Comparative experiments against representative lightweight detectors show that AquaFusionNet provides higher accuracy at comparable or lower power, and field results indicate that cross-modal coupling reduces common failure modes of unimodal detectors, particularly under fouling, turbidity spikes, and inconsistent illumination. All models, data, and hardware designs are released openly to facilitate replication and adaptation in decentralized water safety infrastructures.

<title>Rhea: Role-aware Heuristic Episodic Attention for Conversational LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, contextual decay, episodic memory, instructional memory, multi-turn conversations<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on single-turn tasks but struggle with multi-turn conversations due to a problem called cumulative contextual decay, where context quality degrades over successive turns because of attention pollution, dilution, and drift. To solve this, the paper introduces Rhea (Role-aware Heuristic Episodic Attention), a framework that separates conversation history into two distinct memory modules: Instructional Memory (IM), which maintains persistent, high-fidelity global constraints using a structural priority mechanism, and Episodic Memory (EM), which dynamically handles user-model interactions through asymmetric noise control and heuristic context retrieval. During inference, Rhea applies priority attention that selectively emphasizes relevant episodic information while always prioritizing global instructions to construct a context with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental evaluation on multi-turn conversation benchmarks such as MT-Eval and Long-MT-Bench+ demonstrates that Rhea reduces performance decay and boosts overall accuracy by 1.04 points on a 10-point scale, marking a 16% relative improvement over strong baselines. Additionally, Rhea achieves near-perfect instruction adherence rates (IAR > 8.1) over extended conversational horizons, confirming its effectiveness in creating instruction-consistent and precise conversational LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on single-turn tasks, yet their effectiveness deteriorates in multi-turn conversations. We define this phenomenon as cumulative contextual decay - a progressive degradation of contextual integrity caused by attention pollution, dilution, and drift. To address this challenge, we propose Rhea (Role-aware Heuristic Episodic Attention), a novel framework that decouples conversation history into two functionally independent memory modules: (1) an Instructional Memory (IM) that persistently stores high-fidelity global constraints via a structural priority mechanism, and (2) an Episodic Memory (EM) that dynamically manages user-model interactions via asymmetric noise control and heuristic context retrieval. During inference, Rhea constructs a high signal-to-noise context by applying its priority attention: selectively integrating relevant episodic information while always prioritizing global instructions. To validate this approach, experiments on multiple multi-turn conversation benchmarks - including MT-Eval and Long-MT-Bench+ - show that Rhea mitigates performance decay and improves overall accuracy by 1.04 points on a 10-point scale (a 16% relative gain over strong baselines). Moreover, Rhea maintains near-perfect instruction fidelity (IAR > 8.1) across long-horizon interactions. These results demonstrate that Rhea provides a principled and effective framework for building more precise, instruction-consistent conversational LLMs.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, user opinion simulation, bias, demographic diversity, CLAIMSIM<br /><br />Summary: This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly those trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to simulate human responses to cross-domain survey questions. The study highlights concerns that LLMs exhibit biases toward dominant viewpoints, which may hinder their capacity to represent users from diverse demographic and cultural backgrounds. Two prompting strategies, direct prompting and chain-of-thought prompting, are evaluated for this task. The authors introduce CLAIMSIM, a novel claim diversification method designed to elicit a wider range of viewpoints from the LLM’s parametric knowledge by providing contextual input. Experimental results show that while CLAIMSIM successfully generates more diverse responses compared to baseline approaches, both it and the prompting methods struggle to accurately mimic varied user perspectives. Further analysis identifies two main challenges: first, LLMs tend to hold fixed viewpoints regardless of changes in demographic features, producing responses from a single perspective; second, when faced with conflicting claims, LLMs find it difficult to reason through subtle nuances tied to demographic differences, limiting their ability to tailor answers to specific user profiles. These findings underscore the need for improved methods to enhance diversity and adaptability in LLM-simulated user opinions. <div>

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate user opinions has received growing attention. Yet LLMs, especially trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), are known to exhibit biases toward dominant viewpoints, raising concerns about their ability to represent users from diverse demographic and cultural backgrounds. In this work, we examine the extent to which LLMs can simulate human responses to cross-domain survey questions through direct prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. We further propose a claim diversification method CLAIMSIM, which elicits viewpoints from LLM parametric knowledge as contextual input. Experiments on the survey question answering task indicate that, while CLAIMSIM produces more diverse responses, both approaches struggle to accurately simulate users. Further analysis reveals two key limitations: (1) LLMs tend to maintain fixed viewpoints across varying demographic features, and generate single-perspective claims; and (2) when presented with conflicting claims, LLMs struggle to reason over nuanced differences among demographic features, limiting their ability to adapt responses to specific user profiles.

<div> PRO-CTCAE, MedDRA, adverse events, patient-reported outcomes, oncology trials<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The study addresses the challenge of selecting an optimal subset of PRO-CTCAE items—patient-reported symptomatic adverse events—for oncology clinical trials, aiming to reduce patient burden and increase compliance while ensuring comprehensive safety monitoring.<br /><br />2. Each PRO-CTCAE symptom term is mapped to corresponding MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs), which are embedded into a high-dimensional semantic space called Safeterm that encapsulates clinical and contextual diversity in MedDRA terminology.<br /><br />3. A utility function combining the relevance of each PRO item to historical adverse event PT data and the incidence of these events is developed to objectively score candidate symptoms.<br /><br />4. Spectral analysis is applied to a combined matrix of utility and diversity to select an orthogonal and balanced set of symptom concepts, ensuring both coverage of relevant safety signals and minimal redundancy.<br /><br />5. The resulting symptom list is rank-ordered by importance with a suggested cut-off based on explained information, making the selection process objective, reproducible, and integrated into the Safeterm trial-safety app.<br /><br />6. The method was evaluated through simulations and oncology case studies where PRO-CTCAE was used, demonstrating effectiveness in streamlining PRO-CTCAE design by leveraging MedDRA semantics and historical safety data. <div>
arXiv:2512.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PRO-CTCAE is an NCI-developed patient-reported outcome system for capturing symptomatic adverse events in oncology trials. It comprises a large library drawn from the CTCAE vocabulary, and item selection for a given trial is typically guided by expected toxicity profiles from prior data. Selecting too many PRO-CTCAE items can burden patients and reduce compliance, while too few may miss important safety signals. We present an automated method to select a minimal yet comprehensive PRO-CTCAE subset based on historical safety data. Each candidate PRO-CTCAE symptom term is first mapped to its corresponding MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs), which are then encoded into Safeterm, a high-dimensional semantic space capturing clinical and contextual diversity in MedDRA terminology. We score each candidate PRO item for relevance to the historical list of adverse event PTs and combine relevance and incidence into a utility function. Spectral analysis is then applied to the combined utility and diversity matrix to identify an orthogonal set of medical concepts that balances relevance and diversity. Symptoms are rank-ordered by importance, and a cut-off is suggested based on the explained information. The tool is implemented as part of the Safeterm trial-safety app. We evaluate its performance using simulations and oncology case studies in which PRO-CTCAE was employed. This automated approach can streamline PRO-CTCAE design by leveraging MedDRA semantics and historical data, providing an objective and reproducible method to balance signal coverage against patient burden.

<title>Large Language Models and Forensic Linguistics: Navigating Opportunities and Threats in the Age of Generative AI</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, forensic linguistics, stylometry, AI-text detection, legal admissibility  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. Large language models (LLMs) pose a dual challenge for forensic linguistics by acting as powerful tools for corpus analysis and authorship attribution, while also disrupting traditional assumptions about individual writing style (idiolect) through style mimicry and synthetic text generation.  
2. Stylometric studies show that although LLMs can closely imitate surface stylistic features, discernible differences remain compared to human writing, creating a forensic tension with important implications.  
3. Existing AI-generated text detection methods, including classifier-based, stylometric, and watermarking techniques, suffer from significant limitations such as high false positive rates for non-native English speakers and susceptibility to adversarial manipulations like homoglyph substitution.  
4. These challenges undermine the reliability and thus the legal admissibility of forensic linguistic evidence under standards like Daubert and Kumho Tire, which demand scientific validity and error rate transparency.  
5. The article recommends reconfiguring forensic linguistics methodologies by integrating hybrid human-AI workflows, adopting explainable detection frameworks beyond binary outputs, and establishing validation protocols that assess errors and biases across diverse linguistic populations. Despite these complexities, the fundamental forensic premise that language conveys information about its producer remains valid but requires adaptation to human-machine authored texts. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present a dual challenge for forensic linguistics. They serve as powerful analytical tools enabling scalable corpus analysis and embedding-based authorship attribution, while simultaneously destabilising foundational assumptions about idiolect through style mimicry, authorship obfuscation, and the proliferation of synthetic texts. Recent stylometric research indicates that LLMs can approximate surface stylistic features yet exhibit detectable differences from human writers, a tension with significant forensic implications. However, current AI-text detection techniques, whether classifier-based, stylometric, or watermarking approaches, face substantial limitations: high false positive rates for non-native English writers and vulnerability to adversarial strategies such as homoglyph substitution. These uncertainties raise concerns under legal admissibility standards, particularly the Daubert and Kumho Tire frameworks. The article concludes that forensic linguistics requires methodological reconfiguration to remain scientifically credible and legally admissible. Proposed adaptations include hybrid human-AI workflows, explainable detection paradigms beyond binary classification, and validation regimes measuring error and bias across diverse populations. The discipline's core insight, i.e., that language reveals information about its producer, remains valid but must accommodate increasingly complex chains of human and machine authorship.

<title>Progress Ratio Embeddings: An Impatience Signal for Robust Length Control in Neural Text Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06938</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06938</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Modern neural language models excel at text generation but struggle with precise control over output length. This paper critiques a recent length control method using Reverse Positional Embeddings (RPE), highlighting its instability when asked to generate text lengths beyond the model's training range. Specifically, using a discrete countdown signal representing the exact remaining tokens causes unstable generation behavior. To address these issues, the authors propose Progress Ratio Embeddings (PRE), which use continuous embeddings linked to a trigonometric impatience signal. PRE can be integrated directly into standard Transformer models, improving length control stability without compromising the quality or accuracy of generated text based on common evaluation metrics. Furthermore, PRE demonstrates strong generalization to target lengths that the model was not trained on. The approach was tested and validated on two prevalent news summarization datasets, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining length fidelity while preserving text generation accuracy.

Keywords: length control, neural language models, reverse positional embeddings, progress ratio embeddings, transformer

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of precise length control in neural text generation. It critiques existing Reverse Positional Embeddings (RPE) methods for instability beyond trained length distributions, especially when using discrete countdown signals. To improve robustness, the authors introduce Progress Ratio Embeddings (PRE), which employ continuous embeddings based on a trigonometric impatience signal, offering a smoother control mechanism. PRE integrates easily into standard Transformer architectures without reducing text generation accuracy according to standard metrics. Experiments reveal that PRE generalizes effectively to lengths unseen during training, an important advantage over prior methods. Validation on two established news summarization benchmarks confirms that PRE maintains stable length fidelity alongside high-quality text generation. This work provides a practical and scalable solution for controlled-length neural text generation. <div>
arXiv:2512.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern neural language models achieve high accuracy in text generation, yet precise control over generation length remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we first investigate a recent length control method based on Reverse Positional Embeddings (RPE) and show its limits when control is requested beyond the training distribution. In particular, using a discrete countdown signal tied to the absolute remaining token count leads to instability. To provide robust length control, we introduce Progress Ratio Embeddings (PRE), as continuous embeddings tied to a trigonometric impatience signal. PRE integrates seamlessly into standard Transformer architectures, providing stable length fidelity without degrading text accuracy under standard evaluation metrics. We further show that PRE generalizes well to unseen target lengths. Experiments on two widely used news-summarization benchmarks validate these findings.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Personality Recognition, PICEPR, Content Generation, Modular Decoder

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces PICEPR (Psychology-Informed Contents Embeddings for Personality Recognition), a novel "Prompting-in-a-Series" algorithm designed to improve personality recognition using Large Language Models (LLMs). PICEPR features two distinct pipelines: (a) Contents, which focuses on generating or summarizing textual data, and (b) Embeddings, which extracts personality features from these generated contents. The algorithm leverages a modularized decoder-only LLM architecture to function both as a feature extractor and a generator of personality-rich content, improving classification tasks related to personality recognition. The researchers conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of their approach and the underlying rationale of the PICEPR algorithm. In their comparative study, they evaluated closed-source LLMs such as OpenAI’s gpt4o and Google’s gemini, as well as open-source models like Mistral AI’s mistral, assessing the quality of content generated by each. Results demonstrate that PICEPR achieves state-of-the-art performance in personality recognition, realizing a significant improvement of 5-15% compared to previous methods. The research repository, including model weights and further resources, is made publicly available for replication and further study at https://research.jingjietan.com/?q=PICEPR. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. This research introduces a novel "Prompting-in-a-Series" algorithm, termed PICEPR (Psychology-Informed Contents Embeddings for Personality Recognition), featuring two pipelines: (a) Contents and (b) Embeddings. The approach demonstrates how a modularised decoder-only LLM can summarize or generate content, which can aid in classifying or enhancing personality recognition functions as a personality feature extractor and a generator for personality-rich content. We conducted various experiments to provide evidence to justify the rationale behind the PICEPR algorithm. Meanwhile, we also explored closed-source models such as \textit{gpt4o} from OpenAI and \textit{gemini} from Google, along with open-source models like \textit{mistral} from Mistral AI, to compare the quality of the generated content. The PICEPR algorithm has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance for personality recognition by 5-15\% improvement.

<title>FVA-RAG: Falsification-Verification Alignment for Mitigating Sycophantic Hallucinations</title>

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, hallucinations, Retrieval Sycophancy, Falsification-Verification Alignment, adversarial retrieval  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models by grounding answers in external documents, but suffer from Retrieval Sycophancy, where retrievers fetch biased supportive documents when queries contain false premises or misconceptions.  
2. This vulnerability causes models to "hallucinate with citations," effectively reinforcing incorrect information through retrieved evidence that aligns with user bias rather than objective truth.  
3. The paper introduces Falsification-Verification Alignment RAG (FVA-RAG), which changes the retrieval approach from Inductive Verification (seeking supporting evidence) to Deductive Falsification (actively seeking contradictory evidence).  
4. FVA-RAG incorporates an Adversarial Retrieval Policy that generates "Kill Queries," designed to surface documents that can disprove or challenge the draft answer, thereby preventing sycophantic retrieval.  
5. A dual-verification mechanism is used to weigh the initial answer against this "Anti-Context," improving factual robustness; preliminary tests on misconception datasets show FVA-RAG significantly reduces sycophantic hallucinations compared to standard RAG, functioning as an inference-time "Red Team" for factual accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2512.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have significantly reduced hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding responses in external context. However, standard RAG architectures suffer from a critical vulnerability: Retrieval Sycophancy. When presented with a query based on a false premise or a common misconception, vector-based retrievers tend to fetch documents that align with the user's bias rather than objective truth, leading the model to "hallucinate with citations."
  In this work, we introduce Falsification-Verification Alignment RAG (FVA-RAG), a framework that shifts the retrieval paradigm from Inductive Verification (seeking support) to Deductive Falsification (seeking disproof). Unlike existing "Self-Correction" methods that rely on internal consistency, FVA-RAG deploys a distinct Adversarial Retrieval Policy that actively generates "Kill Queries"-targeted search terms designed to surface contradictory evidence. We introduce a dual-verification mechanism that explicitly weighs the draft answer against this "Anti-Context." Preliminary experiments on a dataset of common misconceptions demonstrate that FVA-RAG significantly improves robustness against sycophantic hallucinations compared to standard RAG baselines, effectively acting as an inference-time "Red Team" for factual generation.

<div> Keywords: large language models, adversarial attacks, safety alignment, model scale, deliberative inference<br /><br />Summary: This study investigates the robustness of large language models (LLMs) to sophisticated multi-turn adversarial attacks, a critical yet underexplored aspect of AI safety. Researchers utilized the TEMPEST multi-turn attack framework to evaluate ten leading models from eight different vendors, testing them against 1,000 harmful behaviors through over 97,000 API queries in adversarial conversational settings. The findings reveal a wide range of vulnerabilities: six models exhibited extremely high attack success rates (ASR) between 96% and 100%, while four models demonstrated notable resistance, with ASRs ranging from 42% to 78%. Importantly, the study discovered that enabling extended reasoning, or deliberative inference, on identical model architectures significantly reduced ASR from 97% to 42%. The results also emphasize that neither model scale nor vendor alone reliably predicts adversarial robustness, highlighting variability in safety alignment quality across providers. Overall, the research concludes that current alignment approaches are fundamentally insufficient against adaptive multi-turn attacks, regardless of model size. Nevertheless, implementing deliberative or “thinking” modes emerges as a promising and deployable strategy to enhance safety in LLMs, offering a potential practical defense direction against adversarial exploitation. <div>
arXiv:2512.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite substantial investment in safety alignment, the vulnerability of large language models to sophisticated multi-turn adversarial attacks remains poorly characterized, and whether model scale or inference mode affects robustness is unknown. This study employed the TEMPEST multi-turn attack framework to evaluate ten frontier models from eight vendors across 1,000 harmful behaviors, generating over 97,000 API queries across adversarial conversations with automated evaluation by independent safety classifiers. Results demonstrated a spectrum of vulnerability: six models achieved 96% to 100% attack success rate (ASR), while four showed meaningful resistance, with ASR ranging from 42% to 78%; enabling extended reasoning on identical architecture reduced ASR from 97% to 42%. These findings indicate that safety alignment quality varies substantially across vendors, that model scale does not predict adversarial robustness, and that thinking mode provides a deployable safety enhancement. Collectively, this work establishes that current alignment techniques remain fundamentally vulnerable to adaptive multi-turn attacks regardless of model scale, while identifying deliberative inference as a promising defense direction.

<div> UMR, semantic representation, text-to-UMR parsing, low-resource languages, SETUP<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR) is a graph-based semantic framework designed to capture the core meaning of texts with an annotation schema flexible enough to cover a wide range of languages, including low-resource ones.<br /><br />2. UMR holds potential for advancing language documentation, improving technologies for languages with limited resources, and providing better interpretability of semantic structures.<br /><br />3. The practical and widespread application of UMR depends on the availability of accurate and scalable text-to-UMR parsers, which are currently underexplored.<br /><br />4. The paper introduces two novel methods for parsing English text into UMR graphs: one that fine-tunes existing Abstract Meaning Representation parsers, and another leveraging a converter from Universal Dependencies, building on prior benchmarks.<br /><br />5. Their best model, named SETUP, demonstrates significant improvements with an AnCast score of 84 and a SMATCH++ score of 91, marking substantial progress toward fully automatic, high-quality text-to-UMR parsing systems. <div>

Abstract: Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR) is a novel graph-based semantic representation which captures the core meaning of a text, with flexibility incorporated into the annotation schema such that the breadth of the world's languages can be annotated (including low-resource languages). While UMR shows promise in enabling language documentation, improving low-resource language technologies, and adding interpretability, the downstream applications of UMR can only be fully explored when text-to-UMR parsers enable the automatic large-scale production of accurate UMR graphs at test time. Prior work on text-to-UMR parsing is limited to date. In this paper, we introduce two methods for English text-to-UMR parsing, one of which fine-tunes existing parsers for Abstract Meaning Representation and the other, which leverages a converter from Universal Dependencies, using prior work as a baseline. Our best-performing model, which we call SETUP, achieves an AnCast score of 84 and a SMATCH++ score of 91, indicating substantial gains towards automatic UMR parsing.

<title>Do Large Language Models Truly Understand Cross-cultural Differences?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: large language models, cross-cultural understanding, benchmarks, scenario-based evaluation, SAGE dataset<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong multilingual task performance, but assessing their cross-cultural understanding remains challenging. <br />2. Existing benchmarks fall short due to limited contextual scenarios, poor cross-cultural concept mapping, and shallow cultural reasoning capabilities.<br />3. To address these limitations, the authors present SAGE, a new scenario-based benchmark designed around cross-cultural core concept alignment and generative task design.<br />4. The benchmark is grounded in cultural theory, defining nine dimensions of cross-cultural capabilities, and includes 210 core concepts and 4530 test items.<br />5. These items are distributed across 15 real-world scenarios grouped under four broad categories of cross-cultural situations, following sound item design principles.<br />6. SAGE is designed for continuous expansion and is demonstrated to be transferable across different languages.<br />7. Experiments using SAGE highlight systematic weaknesses and limitations in LLMs’ cross-cultural reasoning and understanding.<br />8. While there has been some progress, current LLMs are still far from achieving truly nuanced cross-cultural comprehension.<br />9. In accordance with anonymity requirements, the authors provide data and code as supplemental materials, with plans to release them publicly in future versions. <div>

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multilingual tasks. Given its wide range of applications, cross-cultural understanding capability is a crucial competency. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating whether LLMs genuinely possess this capability suffer from three key limitations: a lack of contextual scenarios, insufficient cross-cultural concept mapping, and limited deep cultural reasoning capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose SAGE, a scenario-based benchmark built via cross-cultural core concept alignment and generative task design, to evaluate LLMs' cross-cultural understanding and reasoning. Grounded in cultural theory, we categorize cross-cultural capabilities into nine dimensions. Using this framework, we curated 210 core concepts and constructed 4530 test items across 15 specific real-world scenarios, organized under four broader categories of cross-cultural situations, following established item design principles. The SAGE dataset supports continuous expansion, and experiments confirm its transferability to other languages. It reveals model weaknesses across both dimensions and scenarios, exposing systematic limitations in cross-cultural reasoning. While progress has been made, LLMs are still some distance away from reaching a truly nuanced cross-cultural understanding. In compliance with the anonymity policy, we include data and code in the supplement materials. In future versions, we will make them publicly available online.

<title>Leveraging KV Similarity for Online Structured Pruning in LLMs</title>

<div> Pruning, Token Filtering, Large Language Models, Attention, Inference Efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces Token Filtering, a novel online structured pruning method designed to accelerate inference in large language models (LLMs) without relying on offline calibration data. Unlike prior approaches that can be unstable due to dataset generalization issues, Token Filtering makes real-time pruning decisions by measuring token redundancy through joint key-value similarity in the attention mechanism. This strategy enables the model to skip computations for redundant tokens, reducing inference costs while retaining essential information. To improve pruning stability, the method employs a variance-aware fusion strategy that adaptively balances key and value similarities across attention heads, ensuring critical tokens are preserved even at high pruning levels. Notably, this approach incurs no additional memory overhead, making it efficient and practical. The effectiveness of Token Filtering is validated through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLaMA-2 (7B/13B), LLaMA-3 (8B), and Mistral (7B). Results show it consistently outperforms existing structured pruning methods by maintaining accuracy on commonsense reasoning tasks and robust performance on challenging benchmarks like MMLU, even when pruning up to 50% of tokens. This work presents a reliable and resource-efficient method for enhancing LLM inference speed without compromising model performance. <div>
arXiv:2512.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference, yet existing approaches often suffer from instability because they rely on offline calibration data that may not generalize across inputs. In this work, we introduce Token Filtering, a lightweight online structured pruning technique that makes pruning decisions directly during inference without any calibration data. The key idea is to measure token redundancy via joint key-value similarity and skip redundant attention computations, thereby reducing inference cost while preserving critical information. To further enhance stability, we design a variance-aware fusion strategy that adaptively weights key and value similarity across heads, ensuring that informative tokens are retained even under high pruning ratios. This design introduces no additional memory overhead and provides a more reliable criterion for token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-2 (7B/13B), LLaMA-3 (8B), and Mistral (7B) demonstrate that Token Filtering consistently outperforms prior structured pruning methods, preserving accuracy on commonsense reasoning benchmarks and maintaining strong performance on challenging tasks such as MMLU, even with 50% pruning.

<div> Keywords: multi-agent framework, visual tools, disagreement resolution, tool calling, vision-language models<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces DART, a novel multi-agent framework designed to improve the use of specialized visual tools within large language models or vision-language models by leveraging disagreements among multiple debating visual agents. These visual agents identify and call upon appropriate expert tools such as object detection, OCR, and spatial reasoning to resolve disagreements, enriching the multi-agent discussions with new information. DART incorporates tool-aligned agreement scores that highlight consensus between agents and expert tools, facilitating more effective dialogues. An aggregator agent then selects the best answer based on the outputs from agents and the tool-related information. The authors evaluate DART on four diverse benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing multi-agent debate frameworks and single-agent tool-calling methods, achieving improvements of 3.4% and 2.4% on A-OKVQA and MMMU datasets respectively. DART also shows adaptability to new tools in applied domains, yielding a 1.3% gain on the M3D medical dataset relative to other strong baselines. Analysis of text overlap across discussion rounds reveals richer interactions in DART compared to prior multi-agent approaches. Lastly, distribution analysis confirms that a variety of tools are consistently employed to resolve disagreements among agents, highlighting DART’s robust and flexible tool utilization strategy. <div>

Abstract: Specialized visual tools can augment large language models or vision language models with expert knowledge (e.g., grounding, spatial reasoning, medical knowledge, etc.), but knowing which tools to call (and when to call them) can be challenging. We introduce DART, a multi-agent framework that uses disagreements between multiple debating visual agents to identify useful visual tools (e.g., object detection, OCR, spatial reasoning, etc.) that can resolve inter-agent disagreement. These tools allow for fruitful multi-agent discussion by introducing new information, and by providing tool-aligned agreement scores that highlight agents in agreement with expert tools, thereby facilitating discussion. We utilize an aggregator agent to select the best answer by providing the agent outputs and tool information. We test DART on four diverse benchmarks and show that our approach improves over multi-agent debate as well as over single agent tool-calling frameworks, beating the next-strongest baseline (multi-agent debate with a judge model) by 3.4% and 2.4% on A-OKVQA and MMMU respectively. We also find that DART adapts well to new tools in applied domains, with a 1.3% improvement on the M3D medical dataset over other strong tool-calling, single agent, and multi-agent baselines. Additionally, we measure text overlap across rounds to highlight the rich discussion in DART compared to existing multi-agent methods. Finally, we study the tool call distribution, finding that diverse tools are reliably used to help resolve disagreement.

<div> Bridging anaphora, GUMBridge, diverse genres, annotation quality, LLM evaluation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Bridging is an anaphoric phenomenon where the interpretation of an entity depends on a previous, non-identical entity in the discourse, exemplified by references such as "the door" relating back to "a house."<br />2. Existing English resources for bridging are limited either in size, coverage of the phenomenon, or genre diversity.<br />3. The paper introduces GUMBridge, a new resource that encompasses 16 diverse English genres, aiming to provide broader coverage of bridging phenomena as well as detailed subtype categorization.<br />4. The authors conduct an evaluation of annotation quality to ensure the reliability of the GUMBridge resource.<br />5. Baseline experiments are conducted using both open and closed source contemporary large language models (LLMs) on tasks relevant to bridging resolution and subtype classification.<br />6. Results show that even with advanced LLMs, accurately resolving bridging anaphora and classifying its subtypes remain challenging tasks in NLP, highlighting the difficulty and the need for further research in this area. <div>

Abstract: Bridging is an anaphoric phenomenon where the referent of an entity in a discourse is dependent on a previous, non-identical entity for interpretation, such as in "There is 'a house'. 'The door' is red," where the door is specifically understood to be the door of the aforementioned house. While there are several existing resources in English for bridging anaphora, most are small, provide limited coverage of the phenomenon, and/or provide limited genre coverage. In this paper, we introduce GUMBridge, a new resource for bridging, which includes 16 diverse genres of English, providing both broad coverage for the phenomenon and granular annotations for the subtype categorization of bridging varieties. We also present an evaluation of annotation quality and report on baseline performance using open and closed source contemporary LLMs on three tasks underlying our data, showing that bridging resolution and subtype classification remain difficult NLP tasks in the age of LLMs.

<div> multilingual simulation, multi-agent systems, sociolinguistic profiles, public opinion modeling, information diffusion<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces MASim, a novel multilingual agent-based simulation framework designed to facilitate multi-turn interactions among generative agents with diverse sociolinguistic backgrounds. Firstly, MASim addresses the limitation of prior monolingual simulations by enabling cross-lingual interaction that mirrors real-world social dynamics. Secondly, it provides two analytical capabilities: modeling global public opinion by simulating how attitudes toward various open-domain hypotheses evolve across different languages and cultures, and studying media influence and information diffusion through autonomous news agents generating dynamic content to shape user behavior. Thirdly, the authors present the MAPS benchmark, which integrates survey questions with demographic personas reflecting global population distributions to instantiate realistic simulations. Fourthly, extensive experiments assessing calibration, sensitivity, and consistency demonstrate that MASim effectively reproduces sociocultural phenomena.

Abstract: Multi-agent role-playing has recently shown promise for studying social behavior with language agents, but existing simulations are mostly monolingual and fail to model cross-lingual interaction, an essential property of real societies. We introduce MASim, the first multilingual agent-based simulation framework that supports multi-turn interaction among generative agents with diverse sociolinguistic profiles. MASim offers two key analyses: (i) global public opinion modeling, by simulating how attitudes toward open-domain hypotheses evolve across languages and cultures, and (ii) media influence and information diffusion, via autonomous news agents that dynamically generate content and shape user behavior. To instantiate simulations, we construct the MAPS benchmark, which combines survey questions and demographic personas drawn from global population distributions. Experiments on calibration, sensitivity, consistency, and cultural case studies show that MASim reproduces sociocultural phenomena and highlights the importance of multilingual simulation for scalable, controlled computational social science.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Temporal Reasoning, Neuro-Symbolic Integration, Reflective Mechanisms, Abductive Reflection  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of temporal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle particularly with complex temporal constraints despite strong performance in other NLP tasks. Existing methods either rely on symbolic approaches that explicitly encode temporal structure but underutilize LLM reasoning capabilities or on reflective mechanisms that revise errors without structured temporal representations, often resulting in inconsistent or hallucinated conclusions. To overcome these issues, the authors propose Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning (NeSTR), a novel framework that combines structured symbolic representations with hybrid reflective reasoning to enhance temporal sensitivity in LLM inference. NeSTR preserves explicit temporal relations through symbolic encoding, enforces logical consistency via verification processes, and improves reasoning accuracy by correcting flawed inferences with abductive reflection. The approach does not require any fine-tuning of the language models and is demonstrated through extensive experiments on diverse temporal question answering benchmarks. Results show that NeSTR achieves superior zero-shot performance and consistently improves temporal reasoning capabilities, underscoring the advantages of neuro-symbolic integration for enhancing temporal understanding in large language models. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, temporal reasoning, particularly under complex temporal constraints, remains a major challenge. To this end, existing approaches have explored symbolic methods, which encode temporal structure explicitly, and reflective mechanisms, which revise reasoning errors through multi-step inference. Nonetheless, symbolic approaches often underutilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while reflective methods typically lack structured temporal representations, which can result in inconsistent or hallucinated reasoning. As a result, even when the correct temporal context is available, LLMs may still misinterpret or misapply time-related information, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning (NeSTR), a novel framework that integrates structured symbolic representations with hybrid reflective reasoning to enhance the temporal sensitivity of LLM inference. NeSTR preserves explicit temporal relations through symbolic encoding, enforces logical consistency via verification, and corrects flawed inferences using abductive reflection. Extensive experiments on diverse temporal question answering benchmarks demonstrate that NeSTR achieves superior zero-shot performance and consistently improves temporal reasoning without any fine-tuning, showcasing the advantage of neuro-symbolic integration in enhancing temporal understanding in large language models.

<div> Error Detection, Large Language Models, Decision Tree, Explainability, Robustness<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses error detection (ED) in tabular data, focusing on identifying incorrect or inconsistent cell values to ensure data quality. 2. Current state-of-the-art methods use large language models (LLMs) as direct labelers to mark errors, but these rely on black-box decision processes that lack explainability and are sensitive to prompt variations, resulting in unstable outputs. 3. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose an LLM-as-an-inducer framework that uses LLMs to generate decision trees for ED (TreeED), which enhances both interpretability and robustness. 4. TreeED queries LLMs with context-based prompts to induce decision tree skeletons where paths represent explicit stepwise decision procedures. Each tree node is either a rule node (simple validation), a Graph Neural Network (GNN) node (complex pattern recognition like functional dependencies), or a leaf node (final error or clean decision). 5. Further, ForestED ensembles multiple such trees, created from uncertainty-based row subset sampling, and applies an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly estimate tree reliability and optimize consensus error detection. Experiments show this approach improves average F1-score by 16.1% over the best existing baselines, while being more explainable and robust. <div>

Abstract: Error detection (ED), which aims to identify incorrect or inconsistent cell values in tabular data, is important for ensuring data quality. Recent state-of-the-art ED methods leverage the pre-trained knowledge and semantic capability embedded in large language models (LLMs) to directly label whether a cell is erroneous. However, this LLM-as-a-labeler pipeline (1) relies on the black box, implicit decision process, thus failing to provide explainability for the detection results, and (2) is highly sensitive to prompts, yielding inconsistent outputs due to inherent model stochasticity, therefore lacking robustness. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-as-an-inducer framework that adopts LLM to induce the decision tree for ED (termed TreeED) and further ensembles multiple such trees for consensus detection (termed ForestED), thereby improving explainability and robustness. Specifically, based on prompts derived from data context, decision tree specifications and output requirements, TreeED queries the LLM to induce the decision tree skeleton, whose root-to-leaf decision paths specify the stepwise procedure for evaluating a given sample. Each tree contains three types of nodes: (1) rule nodes that perform simple validation checks (e.g., format or range), (2) Graph Neural Network (GNN) nodes that capture complex patterns (e.g., functional dependencies), and (3) leaf nodes that output the final decision types (error or clean). Furthermore, ForestED employs uncertainty-based sampling to obtain multiple row subsets, constructing a decision tree for each subset using TreeED. It then leverages an Expectation-Maximization-based algorithm that jointly estimates tree reliability and optimizes the consensus ED prediction. Extensive xperiments demonstrate that our methods are accurate, explainable and robust, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 16.1% over the best baseline.

<div> Telugu, Speech Translation, End-to-End Models, Evaluation Metrics, Low-Resource Languages  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the underexplored area of Telugu–English speech translation, a vital task given Telugu’s status as a morphologically rich language spoken by over 80 million people. The authors create a high-quality benchmark based on 46 hours of manually verified CSTD corpus data divided into training, development, and test sets (30h/8h/8h). They systematically compare cascaded architectures like IndicWhisper + IndicMT, which excel due to abundant Telugu-specific data, with end-to-end models such as finetuned SeamlessM4T, which show competitive performance using significantly less Telugu-specific data. This demonstrates that with appropriate hyperparameter tuning and under 100 hours of parallel data, end-to-end speech translation systems can rival more complex cascaded approaches in low-resource contexts. Additionally, the study conducts a thorough metric reliability evaluation using BLEU, METEOR, ChrF++, ROUGE-L, TER, and BERTScore against human judgment, finding that traditional metrics better distinguish translation quality than BERTScore for Telugu-English pairs. The contributions include: a reproducible Telugu–English speech translation benchmark, new empirical insights into the efficacy of end-to-end models in low-resource settings, and practical recommendations on choosing automatic evaluation metrics for morphologically complex language pairs. <div>

Abstract: Despite Telugu being spoken by over 80 million people, speech translation research for this morphologically rich language remains severely underexplored. We address this gap by developing a high-quality Telugu--English speech translation benchmark from 46 hours of manually verified CSTD corpus data (30h/8h/8h train/dev/test split). Our systematic comparison of cascaded versus end-to-end architectures shows that while IndicWhisper + IndicMT achieves the highest performance due to extensive Telugu-specific training data, finetuned SeamlessM4T models demonstrate remarkable competitiveness despite using significantly less Telugu-specific training data. This finding suggests that with careful hyperparameter tuning and sufficient parallel data (potentially less than 100 hours), end-to-end systems can achieve performance comparable to cascaded approaches in low-resource settings. Our metric reliability study evaluating BLEU, METEOR, ChrF++, ROUGE-L, TER, and BERTScore against human judgments reveals that traditional metrics provide better quality discrimination than BERTScore for Telugu--English translation. The work delivers three key contributions: a reproducible Telugu--English benchmark, empirical evidence of competitive end-to-end performance potential in low-resource scenarios, and practical guidance for automatic evaluation in morphologically complex language pairs.

<div> Keywords: low-resource languages, cross-lingual pretraining, Perso-Arabic languages, automatic speech recognition, unlabeled speech data<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages, which suffer from limited labeled data and the high computational demands of current state-of-the-art models. <br />2. It focuses on cross-lingual continuous pretraining, using Perso-Arabic languages—Persian, Arabic, and Urdu—as the main case study to explore resource-efficient ASR development.<br />3. The authors create a large-scale, 3,000-hour unlabeled multilingual speech corpus via a scalable data collection pipeline to harness unlabeled data effectively.<br />4. Their approach integrates targeted continual pretraining with morphologically-aware tokenization to optimize model training for linguistic characteristics, resulting in a compact 300 million parameter ASR model.<br />5. This model surpasses the performance of much larger models, notably outperforming Whisper Large v3 (1.5 billion parameters) on Persian, and achieving competitive results on Arabic and Urdu, demonstrating that model size is not the only determinant of ASR quality.<br />6. The study highlights that the relevance of data and strategic pretraining techniques are more crucial than sheer model scale in low-resource settings, offering a practical method to develop inclusive speech technology without relying on massive datasets or infrastructure.<br />7. Overall, this work paves the way for building effective, resource-aware ASR systems that support underrepresented languages, promoting technological inclusivity. <div>

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition for low-resource languages remains fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and computational resources required by state-of-the-art models. We present a systematic investigation into cross-lingual continuous pretraining for low-resource languages, using Perso-Arabic languages (Persian, Arabic, and Urdu) as our primary case study. Our approach demonstrates that strategic utilization of unlabeled speech data can effectively bridge the resource gap without sacrificing recognition accuracy. We construct a 3,000-hour multilingual corpus through a scalable unlabeled data collection pipeline and employ targeted continual pretraining combined with morphologically-aware tokenization to develop a 300M parameter model that achieves performance comparable to systems 5 times larger. Our model outperforms Whisper Large v3 (1.5B parameters) on Persian and achieves competitive results on Arabic and Urdu despite using significantly fewer parameters and substantially less labeled data. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that ASR quality scales primarily with model size, revealing instead that data relevance and strategic pretraining are more critical factors for low-resource scenarios. This work provides a practical pathway toward inclusive speech technology, enabling effective ASR for underrepresented languages without dependence on massive computational infrastructure or proprietary datasets.

<title>Investigating Training and Generalization in Faithful Self-Explanations of Large Language Models</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, faithful self-explanations, explanation styles, continual learning, generalization  

<br /><br />Summary: This study investigates how to improve the faithfulness of explanations generated by large language models (LLMs) for their own predictions. Recent work has shown that although LLMs can produce explanations in various styles based on user instructions, these self-explanations are often not faithful to the model’s true reasoning process. To address this, the researchers use a method to generate one-word constrained explanations highly likely to be faithful by leveraging feature attribution techniques. These pseudo-faithful explanations are then used for continual learning on instruction-tuned models. The experimental setup includes three classification tasks and three different explanation styles. Results demonstrate that training with pseudo-faithful explanations improves the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations across all tested tasks and explanation styles. Additionally, improvements made in one style tend to generalize to other explanation styles, including multi-word explanations and tasks not seen during training. This cross-style generalization suggests that the training process contributes to a broader enhancement of the models' ability to produce faithful self-explanations. Overall, the work highlights continual learning with pseudo-faithful explanations as a promising direction to enhance the interpretability and reliability of LLM-generated explanations. <div>
arXiv:2512.07288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have the potential to generate explanations for their own predictions in a variety of styles based on user instructions. Recent research has examined whether these self-explanations faithfully reflect the models' actual behavior and has found that they often lack faithfulness. However, the question of how to improve faithfulness remains underexplored. Moreover, because different explanation styles have superficially distinct characteristics, it is unclear whether improvements observed in one style also arise when using other styles. This study analyzes the effects of training for faithful self-explanations and the extent to which these effects generalize, using three classification tasks and three explanation styles. We construct one-word constrained explanations that are likely to be faithful using a feature attribution method, and use these pseudo-faithful self-explanations for continual learning on instruction-tuned models. Our experiments demonstrate that training can improve self-explanation faithfulness across all classification tasks and explanation styles, and that these improvements also show signs of generalization to the multi-word settings and to unseen tasks. Furthermore, we find consistent cross-style generalization among three styles, suggesting that training may contribute to a broader improvement in faithful self-explanation ability.

<div> Keywords: multilingual corpus, non-technological innovation, automatic extraction, supervised classification, natural language processing<br /><br />Summary: This article introduces a hybrid methodology for constructing a multilingual corpus to investigate emerging concepts within the humanities and social sciences, specifically focusing on "non-technological innovation." The corpus is built from two complementary sources: textual data automatically extracted from company websites in French and English, and annual reports gathered and filtered based on documentary criteria such as year, format, and duplication. The data processing pipeline incorporates automatic language detection, removal of non-relevant content, extraction of pertinent text segments, and enrichment with structural metadata. From this foundational corpus, a derived English-language dataset is created to support machine learning applications. Each instance of a term from an expert lexicon is identified, and a contextual block of five sentences (two before and two after the target sentence) is extracted. These occurrences are annotated with thematic categories linked to the terms, facilitating the generation of labeled data suitable for supervised classification tasks. The resulting resource is reproducible and extensible, enabling researchers to analyze lexical variability of emerging concepts and to develop datasets tailored for natural language processing tasks. <div>

Abstract: This article presents a hybrid methodology for building a multilingual corpus designed to support the study of emerging concepts in the humanities and social sciences (HSS), illustrated here through the case of ``non-technological innovation''. The corpus relies on two complementary sources: (1) textual content automatically extracted from company websites, cleaned for French and English, and (2) annual reports collected and automatically filtered according to documentary criteria (year, format, duplication). The processing pipeline includes automatic language detection, filtering of non-relevant content, extraction of relevant segments, and enrichment with structural metadata. From this initial corpus, a derived dataset in English is created for machine learning purposes. For each occurrence of a term from the expert lexicon, a contextual block of five sentences is extracted (two preceding and two following the sentence containing the term). Each occurrence is annotated with the thematic category associated with the term, enabling the construction of data suitable for supervised classification tasks. This approach results in a reproducible and extensible resource, suitable both for analyzing lexical variability around emerging concepts and for generating datasets dedicated to natural language processing applications.

<title>Training Language Models to Use Prolog as a Tool</title>

Abstract: Ensuring reliable tool use is critical for safe agentic AI systems. Language models frequently produce unreliable reasoning with plausible but incorrect solutions that are difficult to verify. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning models to use Prolog as an external tool for verifiable computation. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we fine-tune Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on a cleaned GSM8K-Prolog-Prover dataset while varying (i) prompt structure, (ii) reward composition (execution, syntax, semantics, structure), and (iii) inference protocol: single-shot, best-of-N, and two agentic modes where Prolog is invoked internally or independently. Our reinforcement learning approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning, with our 3B model achieving zero-shot MMLU performance comparable to 7B few-shot results. Our findings reveal that: 1) joint tuning of prompt, reward, and inference shapes program syntax and logic; 2) best-of-N with external Prolog verification maximizes accuracy on GSM8K; 3) agentic inference with internal repair yields superior zero-shot generalization on MMLU-Stem and MMLU-Pro. These results demonstrate that grounding model reasoning in formal verification systems substantially improves reliability and auditability for safety-critical applications. The source code for reproducing our experiments is available under https://github.com/niklasmellgren/grpo-prolog-inference

Abstract: The democratization of AI is currently hindered by the immense computational costs required to train Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource languages. This paper presents Persian-Phi, a 3.8B parameter model that challenges the assumption that robust multilingual capabilities require massive model sizes or multilingual baselines. We demonstrate how Microsoft Phi-3 Mini -- originally a monolingual English model -- can be effectively adapted to Persian through a novel, resource-efficient curriculum learning pipeline. Our approach employs a unique "warm-up" stage using bilingual narratives (Tiny Stories) to align embeddings prior to heavy training, followed by continual pretraining and instruction tuning via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). Despite its compact size, Persian-Phi achieves competitive results on Open Persian LLM Leaderboard in HuggingFace. Our findings provide a validated, scalable framework for extending the reach of state-of-the-art LLMs to underrepresented languages with minimal hardware resources. The Persian-Phi model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/amirakhlaghiqqq/PersianPhi.

arXiv:2512.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Native Parallel Reasoner (NPR), a teacher-free framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-evolve genuine parallel reasoning capabilities. NPR transforms the model from sequential emulation to native parallel cognition through three key innovations: 1) a self-distilled progressive training paradigm that transitions from ``cold-start'' format discovery to strict topological constraints without external supervision; 2) a novel Parallel-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO) algorithm that optimizes branching policies directly within the execution graph, allowing the model to learn adaptive decomposition via trial and error; and 3) a robust NPR Engine that refactors memory management and flow control of SGLang to enable stable, large-scale parallel RL training. Across eight reasoning benchmarks, NPR trained on Qwen3-4B achieves performance gains of up to 24.5% and inference speedups up to 4.6x. Unlike prior baselines that often fall back to autoregressive decoding, NPR demonstrates 100% genuine parallel execution, establishing a new standard for self-evolving, efficient, and scalable agentic reasoning.

<title>Enhancing Agentic RL with Progressive Reward Shaping and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) can iteratively plan, call external tools, and integrate returned information to solve complex, long-horizon reasoning tasks. Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) optimizes such models over full tool-interaction trajectories, but two key challenges hinder effectiveness: (1) Sparse, non-instructive rewards, such as binary 0-1 verifiable signals, provide limited guidance for intermediate steps and slow convergence; (2) Gradient degradation in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), where identical rewards within a rollout group yield zero advantage, reducing sample efficiency and destabilizing training. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary techniques: Progressive Reward Shaping (PRS) and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization (VSPO). PRS is a curriculum-inspired reward design that introduces dense, stage-wise feedback - encouraging models to first master parseable and properly formatted tool calls, then optimize for factual correctness and answer quality. We instantiate PRS for short-form QA (with a length-aware BLEU to fairly score concise answers) and long-form QA (with LLM-as-a-Judge scoring to prevent reward hacking). VSPO is an enhanced GRPO variant that replaces low-value samples with prompts selected by a task-value metric balancing difficulty and uncertainty, and applies value-smoothing clipping to stabilize gradient updates. Experiments on multiple short-form and long-form QA benchmarks show that PRS consistently outperforms traditional binary rewards, and VSPO achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and higher final performance compared to PPO, GRPO, CISPO, and SFT-only baselines. Together, PRS and VSPO yield LLM-based TIR agents that generalize better across domains.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remains a challenge. Prior approaches attribute hallucinations to a binary conflict between internal knowledge (stored in FFNs) and retrieved context. However, this perspective is incomplete, failing to account for the impact of other components in the generative process, such as the user query, previously generated tokens, the current token itself, and the final LayerNorm adjustment. To address this, we introduce SPAD. First, we mathematically attribute each token's probability into seven distinct sources: Query, RAG, Past, Current Token, FFN, Final LayerNorm, and Initial Embedding. This attribution quantifies how each source contributes to the generation of the current token. Then, we aggregate these scores by POS tags to quantify how different components drive specific linguistic categories. By identifying anomalies, such as Nouns relying on Final LayerNorm, SPAD effectively detects hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPAD achieves state-of-the-art performance

<title>LIME: Making LLM Data More Efficient with Linguistic Metadata Embeddings</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-training decoder-only language models relies on vast amounts of high-quality data, yet the availability of such data is increasingly reaching its limits. While metadata is commonly used to create and curate these datasets, its potential as a direct training signal remains under-explored. We challenge this status quo and propose LIME (Linguistic Metadata Embeddings), a method that enriches token embeddings with metadata capturing syntax, semantics, and contextual properties. LIME substantially improves pre-training efficiency. Specifically, it adapts up to 56% faster to the training data distribution, while introducing only 0.01% additional parameters at negligible compute overhead. Beyond efficiency, LIME improves tokenization, leading to remarkably stronger language modeling capabilities and generative task performance. These benefits persist across model scales (500M to 2B). In addition, we develop a variant with shifted metadata, LIME+1, that can guide token generation. Given prior metadata for the next token, LIME+1 improves reasoning performance by up to 38% and arithmetic accuracy by up to 35%.

<title>Beyond Real: Imaginary Extension of Rotary Position Embeddings for Long-Context LLMs</title>

Abstract: Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) have become a standard for encoding sequence order in Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying rotations to query and key vectors in the complex plane. Standard implementations, however, utilize only the real component of the complex-valued dot product for attention score calculation. This simplification discards the imaginary component, which contains valuable phase information, leading to a potential loss of relational details crucial for modeling long-context dependencies. In this paper, we propose an extension that re-incorporates this discarded imaginary component. Our method leverages the full complex-valued representation to create a dual-component attention score. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that this approach enhances the modeling of long-context dependencies by preserving more positional information. Furthermore, evaluations on a suite of long-context language modeling benchmarks show that our method consistently improves performance over the standard RoPE, with the benefits becoming more significant as context length increases. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenMOSS/rope_pp.

Abstract: Recognizing semantic differences across documents, especially in different languages, is crucial for text generation evaluation and multilingual content alignment. However, as a standalone task it has received little attention. We address this by introducing SwissGov-RSD, the first naturalistic, document-level, cross-lingual dataset for semantic difference recognition. It encompasses a total of 224 multi-parallel documents in English-German, English-French, and English-Italian with token-level difference annotations by human annotators. We evaluate a variety of open-source and closed source large language models as well as encoder models across different fine-tuning settings on this new benchmark. Our results show that current automatic approaches perform poorly compared to their performance on monolingual, sentence-level, and synthetic benchmarks, revealing a considerable gap for both LLMs and encoder models. We make our code and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: Error Span Detection (ESD) is a subtask of automatic machine translation evaluation that localizes error spans in translations and labels their severity. State-of-the-art generative ESD methods typically decode using Maximum a Posteriori (MAP), assuming that model-estimated probabilities are perfectly correlated with similarity to human annotation. However, we observed that annotations dissimilar to the human annotation could achieve a higher model likelihood than the human annotation. We address this issue by applying Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to generative ESD models. Specifically, we employ sentence- and span-level similarity metrics as utility functions to select candidate hypotheses based on their approximate similarity to the human annotation. Extensive experimental results show that our MBR decoding outperforms the MAP baseline at the system, sentence, and span-levels. Furthermore, to mitigate the computational cost of MBR decoding, we demonstrate that applying MBR distillation enables a standard greedy model to match MBR decoding performance, effectively eliminating the inference-time latency bottleneck.

<title>Most over-representation of phonological features in basic vocabulary disappears when controlling for spatial and phylogenetic effects</title>

Abstract: The statistical over-representation of phonological features in the basic vocabulary of languages is often interpreted as reflecting potentially universal sound symbolic patterns. However, most of those results have not been tested explicitly for reproducibility and might be prone to biases in the study samples or models. Many studies on the topic do not adequately control for genealogical and areal dependencies between sampled languages, casting doubts on the robustness of the results. In this study, we test the robustness of a recent study on sound symbolism of basic vocabulary concepts which analyzed245 languages.The new sample includes data on 2864 languages from Lexibank. We modify the original model by adding statistical controls for spatial and phylogenetic dependencies between languages. The new results show that most of the previously observed patterns are not robust, and in fact many patterns disappear completely when adding the genealogical and areal controls. A small number of patterns, however, emerges as highly stable even with the new sample. Through the new analysis, we are able to assess the distribution of sound symbolism on a larger scale than previously. The study further highlights the need for testing all universal claims on language for robustness on various levels.

<title>MoCoRP: Modeling Consistent Relations between Persona and Response for Persona-based Dialogue</title>

Abstract: As dialogue systems become increasingly important across various domains, a key challenge in persona-based dialogue is generating engaging and context-specific interactions while ensuring the model acts with a coherent personality. However, existing persona-based dialogue datasets lack explicit relations between persona sentences and responses, which makes it difficult for models to effectively capture persona information. To address these issues, we propose MoCoRP (Modeling Consistent Relations between Persona and Response), a framework that incorporates explicit relations into language models. MoCoRP leverages an NLI expert to explicitly extract the NLI relations between persona sentences and responses, enabling the model to effectively incorporate appropriate persona information from the context into its responses. We applied this framework to pre-trained models like BART and further extended it to modern large language models (LLMs) through alignment tuning. Experimental results on the public datasets ConvAI2 and MPChat demonstrate that MoCoRP outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior persona consistency and engaging, context-aware dialogue generation. Furthermore, our model not only excels in quantitative metrics but also shows significant improvements in qualitative aspects. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling persona-response relations in persona-based dialogue. The source codes of MoCoRP are available at https://github.com/DMCB-GIST/MoCoRP.

<title>Performance of the SafeTerm AI-Based MedDRA Query System Against Standardised MedDRA Queries</title>

Abstract: In pre-market drug safety review, grouping related adverse event terms into SMQs or OCMQs is critical for signal detection. We assess the performance of SafeTerm Automated Medical Query (AMQ) on MedDRA SMQs. The AMQ is a novel quantitative artificial intelligence system that understands and processes medical terminology and automatically retrieves relevant MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) for a given input query, ranking them by a relevance score (0-1) using multi-criteria statistical methods. The system (SafeTerm) embeds medical query terms and MedDRA PTs in a multidimensional vector space, then applies cosine similarity, and extreme-value clustering to generate a ranked list of PTs. Validation was conducted against tier-1 SMQs (110 queries, v28.1). Precision, recall and F1 were computed at multiple similarity-thresholds, defined either manually or using an automated method. High recall (94%)) is achieved at moderate similarity thresholds, indicative of good retrieval sensitivity. Higher thresholds filter out more terms, resulting in improved precision (up to 89%). The optimal threshold (0.70)) yielded an overall recall of (48%) and precision of (45%) across all 110 queries. Restricting to narrow-term PTs achieved slightly better performance at an increased (+0.05) similarity threshold, confirming increased relatedness of narrow versus broad terms. The automatic threshold (0.66) selection prioritizes recall (0.58) to precision (0.29). SafeTerm AMQ achieves comparable, satisfactory performance on SMQs and sanitized OCMQs. It is therefore a viable supplementary method for automated MedDRA query generation, balancing recall and precision. We recommend using suitable MedDRA PT terminology in query formulation and applying the automated threshold method to optimise recall. Increasing similarity scores allows refined, narrow terms selection.

<title>A Simple Method to Enhance Pre-trained Language Models with Speech Tokens for Classification</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a simple method that allows to easily enhance textual pre-trained large language models with speech information, when fine-tuned for a specific classification task. A classical issue with the fusion of many embeddings from audio with text is the large length of the audio sequence compared to the text one. Our method benefits from an existing speech tokenizer trained for Audio Speech Recognition that output long sequences of tokens from a large vocabulary, making it difficult to integrate it at low cost in a large language model. By applying a simple lasso-based feature selection on multimodal Bag-of-Words representation, we retain only the most important audio tokens for the task, and adapt the language model to them with a self-supervised language modeling objective, before fine-tuning it on the downstream task. We show this helps to improve the performances compared to an unimodal model, to a bigger SpeechLM or to integrating audio via a learned representation. We show the effectiveness of our method on two recent Argumentative Fallacy Detection and Classification tasks where the use of audio was believed counterproductive, reaching state-of-the-art results. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the method, showing that even a random audio token selection helps enhancing the unimodal model. Our code is available [online](https://github.com/salocinc/EACL26SpeechTokFallacy/).

Abstract: In this study, we propose a structured methodology that utilizes large language models (LLMs) in a cost-efficient and parsimonious manner, integrating the strengths of scholars and machines while offsetting their respective weaknesses. Our methodology, facilitated through a chain of thought and few-shot learning prompting from computer science, extends best practices for co-author teams in qualitative research to human-machine teams in quantitative research. This allows humans to utilize abductive reasoning and natural language to interrogate not just what the machine has done but also what the human has done. Our method highlights how scholars can manage inherent weaknesses OF LLMs using careful, low-cost techniques. We demonstrate how to use the methodology to interrogate human-machine rating discrepancies for a sample of 1,934 press releases announcing pharmaceutical alliances (1990-2017).

<title>Metric-Fair Prompting: Treating Similar Samples Similarly</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.07608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{Metric-Fair Prompting}, a fairness-aware prompting framework that guides large language models (LLMs) to make decisions under metric-fairness constraints. In the application of multiple-choice medical question answering, each {(question, option)} pair is treated as a binary instance with label $+1$ (correct) or $-1$ (incorrect). To promote {individual fairness}~--~treating similar instances similarly~--~we compute question similarity using NLP embeddings and solve items in \emph{joint pairs of similar questions} rather than in isolation. The prompt enforces a global decision protocol: extract decisive clinical features, map each \((\text{question}, \text{option})\) to a score $f(x)$ that acts as confidence, and impose a Lipschitz-style constraint so that similar inputs receive similar scores and, hence, consistent outputs. Evaluated on the {MedQA (US)} benchmark, Metric-Fair Prompting is shown to improve performance over standard single-item prompting, demonstrating that fairness-guided, confidence-oriented reasoning can enhance LLM accuracy on high-stakes clinical multiple-choice questions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has resulted in a significant knowledge gap between the open-source community and industry, primarily because the latter relies on closed-source, high-quality data and training recipes. To address this, we introduce PCMind-2.1-Kaiyuan-2B, a fully open-source 2-billion-parameter model focused on improving training efficiency and effectiveness under resource constraints. Our methodology includes three key innovations: a Quantile Data Benchmarking method for systematically comparing heterogeneous open-source datasets and providing insights on data mixing strategies; a Strategic Selective Repetition scheme within a multi-phase paradigm to effectively leverage sparse, high-quality data; and a Multi-Domain Curriculum Training policy that orders samples by quality. Supported by a highly optimized data preprocessing pipeline and architectural modifications for FP16 stability, Kaiyuan-2B achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art fully open-source models, demonstrating practical and scalable solutions for resource-limited pretraining. We release all assets (including model weights, data, and code) under Apache 2.0 license at https://huggingface.co/thu-pacman/PCMind-2.1-Kaiyuan-2B.

<title>Bridging Code Graphs and Large Language Models for Better Code Understanding</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in code intelligence tasks such as code generation, summarization, and translation. However, their reliance on linearized token sequences limits their ability to understand the structural semantics of programs. While prior studies have explored graphaugmented prompting and structure-aware pretraining, they either suffer from prompt length constraints or require task-specific architectural changes that are incompatible with large-scale instructionfollowing LLMs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CGBridge, a novel plug-and-play method that enhances LLMs with Code Graph information through an external, trainable Bridge module. CGBridge first pre-trains a code graph encoder via selfsupervised learning on a large-scale dataset of 270K code graphs to learn structural code semantics. It then trains an external module to bridge the modality gap among code, graph, and text by aligning their semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. Finally, the bridge module generates structure-informed prompts, which are injected into a frozen LLM, and is fine-tuned for downstream code intelligence tasks. Experiments show that CGBridge achieves notable improvements over both the original model and the graphaugmented prompting method. Specifically, it yields a 16.19% and 9.12% relative gain in LLM-as-a-Judge on code summarization, and a 9.84% and 38.87% relative gain in Execution Accuracy on code translation. Moreover, CGBridge achieves over 4x faster inference than LoRA-tuned models, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in structure-aware code understanding.

<title>When Large Language Models Do Not Work: Online Incivility Prediction through Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Online incivility has emerged as a widespread and persistent problem in digital communities, imposing substantial social and psychological burdens on users. Although many platforms attempt to curb incivility through moderation and automated detection, the performance of existing approaches often remains limited in both accuracy and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting three types of uncivil behavior (i.e., toxicity, aggression, and personal attacks) within the English Wikipedia community. Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments. We also introduce a dynamically adjusted attention mechanism that adaptively balances nodal and topological features during information aggregation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms 12 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple metrics while requiring significantly lower inference cost. These findings highlight the crucial role of structural context in detecting online incivility and address the limitations of text-only LLM paradigms in behavioral prediction. All datasets and comparative outputs will be publicly available in our repository to support further research and reproducibility.

<title>HalluShift++: Bridging Language and Vision through Internal Representation Shifts for Hierarchical Hallucinations in MLLMs</title>

arXiv:2512.07687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language understanding tasks. While these models often produce linguistically coherent output, they often suffer from hallucinations, generating descriptions that are factually inconsistent with the visual content, potentially leading to adverse consequences. Therefore, the assessment of hallucinations in MLLM has become increasingly crucial in the model development process. Contemporary methodologies predominantly depend on external LLM evaluators, which are themselves susceptible to hallucinations and may present challenges in terms of domain adaptation. In this study, we propose the hypothesis that hallucination manifests as measurable irregularities within the internal layer dynamics of MLLMs, not merely due to distributional shifts but also in the context of layer-wise analysis of specific assumptions. By incorporating such modifications, \textsc{\textsc{HalluShift++}} broadens the efficacy of hallucination detection from text-based large language models (LLMs) to encompass multimodal scenarios. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/C0mRD/HalluShift_Plus.

Abstract: In pre-market drug safety review, grouping related adverse event terms into standardised MedDRA queries or the FDA Office of New Drugs Custom Medical Queries (OCMQs) is critical for signal detection. We present a novel quantitative artificial intelligence system that understands and processes medical terminology and automatically retrieves relevant MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) for a given input query, ranking them by a relevance score using multi-criteria statistical methods. The system (SafeTerm) embeds medical query terms and MedDRA PTs in a multidimensional vector space, then applies cosine similarity and extreme-value clustering to generate a ranked list of PTs. Validation was conducted against the FDA OCMQ v3.0 (104 queries), restricted to valid MedDRA PTs. Precision, recall and F1 were computed across similarity-thresholds. High recall (>95%) is achieved at moderate thresholds. Higher thresholds improve precision (up to 86%). The optimal threshold (~0.70 - 0.75) yielded recall ~50% and precision ~33%. Narrow-term PT subsets performed similarly but required slightly higher similarity thresholds. The SafeTerm AI-driven system provides a viable supplementary method for automated MedDRA query generation. A similarity threshold of ~0.60 is recommended initially, with increased thresholds for refined term selection.

<title>Mary, the Cheeseburger-Eating Vegetarian: Do LLMs Recognize Incoherence in Narratives?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging a dataset of paired narratives, we investigate the extent to which large language models (LLMs) can reliably separate incoherent and coherent stories. A probing study finds that LLMs' internal representations can reliably identify incoherent narratives. However, LLMs generate responses to rating questions that fail to satisfactorily separate the coherent and incoherent narratives across several prompt variations, hinting at a gap in LLM's understanding of storytelling. The reasoning LLMs tested do not eliminate these deficits, indicating that thought strings may not be able to fully address the discrepancy between model internal state and behavior. Additionally, we find that LLMs appear to be more sensitive to incoherence resulting from an event that violates the setting (e.g., a rainy day in the desert) than to incoherence arising from a character violating an established trait (e.g., Mary, a vegetarian, later orders a cheeseburger), suggesting that LLMs may rely more on prototypical world knowledge than building meaning-based narrative coherence. The consistent asymmetry found in our results suggests that LLMs do not have a complete grasp on narrative coherence.

<title>On the Interplay of Pre-Training, Mid-Training, and RL on Reasoning Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have yielded impressive reasoning improvements in language models, yet it remains unclear whether post-training truly extends a model's reasoning ability beyond what it acquires during pre-training. A central challenge is the lack of control in modern training pipelines: large-scale pre-training corpora are opaque, mid-training is often underexamined, and RL objectives interact with unknown prior knowledge in complex ways. To resolve this ambiguity, we develop a fully controlled experimental framework that isolates the causal contributions of pre-training, mid-training, and RL-based post-training. Our approach employs synthetic reasoning tasks with explicit atomic operations, parseable step-by-step reasoning traces, and systematic manipulation of training distributions. We evaluate models along two axes: extrapolative generalization to more complex compositions and contextual generalization across surface contexts. Using this framework, we reconcile competing views on RL's effectiveness. We show that: 1) RL produces true capability gains (pass@128) only when pre-training leaves sufficient headroom and when RL data target the model's edge of competence, tasks at the boundary that are difficult but not yet out of reach. 2) Contextual generalization requires minimal yet sufficient pre-training exposure, after which RL can reliably transfer. 3) Mid-training significantly enhances performance under fixed compute compared with RL only, demonstrating its central but underexplored role in training pipelines. 4) Process-level rewards reduce reward hacking and improve reasoning fidelity. Together, these results clarify the interplay between pre-training, mid-training, and RL, offering a foundation for understanding and improving reasoning LM training strategies.

<title>Collaborative Causal Sensemaking: Closing the Complementarity Gap in Human-AI Decision Support</title>

Abstract: LLM-based agents are rapidly being plugged into expert decision-support, yet in messy, high-stakes settings they rarely make the team smarter: human-AI teams often underperform the best individual, experts oscillate between verification loops and over-reliance, and the promised complementarity does not materialise. We argue this is not just a matter of accuracy, but a fundamental gap in how we conceive AI assistance: expert decisions are made through collaborative cognitive processes where mental models, goals, and constraints are continually co-constructed, tested, and revised between human and AI. We propose Collaborative Causal Sensemaking (CCS) as a research agenda and organizing framework for decision-support agents: systems designed as partners in cognitive work, maintaining evolving models of how particular experts reason, helping articulate and revise goals, co-constructing and stress-testing causal hypotheses, and learning from the outcomes of joint decisions so that both human and agent improve over time. We sketch challenges around training ecologies that make collaborative thinking instrumentally valuable, representations and interaction protocols for co-authored models, and evaluation centred on trust and complementarity. These directions can reframe MAS research around agents that participate in collaborative sensemaking and act as AI teammates that think with their human partners.

Abstract: A large language model's (LLM's) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation ability is crucial to its deployment. Previous work assessing LLMs' generalisation performance, however, typically focuses on a single out-of-distribution dataset. This approach may fail to precisely evaluate the capabilities of the model, as the data shifts encountered once a model is deployed are much more diverse. In this work, we investigate whether OOD generalisation results generalise. More specifically, we evaluate a model's performance across multiple OOD testsets throughout a finetuning run; we then evaluate the partial correlation of performances across these testsets, regressing out in-domain performance. This allows us to assess how correlated are generalisation performances once in-domain performance is controlled for. Analysing OLMo2 and OPT, we observe no overarching trend in generalisation results: the existence of a positive or negative correlation between any two OOD testsets depends strongly on the specific choice of model analysed.

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental to AI sub-fields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo, using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. The crucial step in this iterative process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals, however, remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a holistic model that encompasses agent bounded rationality and uncertainty and developing AI models to generate such compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaboratively writing text documents -- e.g., to enable the democratic creation of a community constitution. We apply NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques and utilize LLMs (Large Language Models) to create a semantic metric space for text and develop algorithms to suggest suitable compromise points. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we simulate various coalition formation processes and demonstrate the potential of AI to facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, such as collaboratively drafting a constitution, an area where traditional tools are limited.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of conversational and diffusion-based AI, there is a growing adoption of AI in educational services, ranging from grading and assessment tools to personalized learning systems that provide targeted support for students. However, this adaptability has yet to fully extend to the domain of children's speech, where existing models often fail due to their reliance on datasets designed for clear, articulate adult speech. Children, particularly those in early developmental stages or with speech and language pathologies, present unique challenges that current AI models and datasets are ill-equipped to handle. To address this, we introduce KidSpeak, a multi-task speech-enhanced Foundation Model capable of both generative and discriminative tasks specifically tailored to children's speech patterns. Our framework employs a two-stage training process that incorporates phonetic knowledge into the speech encoder, achieving an average accuracy of 87% across four separate tasks. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations of scalable human annotation and existing speech alignment tools, we propose the Flexible and Automatic Speech Aligner (FASA) and leverage the method to construct high quality datasets for training and evaluation. This novel alignment tool significantly improves the quality of aligned children's speech from noisy data, enhancing data quality by 13.6x compared to human annotations, as demonstrated on the CHILDES dataset. To the best of our knowledge, KidSpeak and FASA represent the first comprehensive solution designed for speech and language therapy in children, offering both a multi-purpose speech LLM and a robust alignment tool.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have introduced novel paradigms in science and education, their adoption in higher education is constrained by inherent limitations. These include a tendency to produce inaccuracies and high computational requirements, which compromise the strict demands for accurate and reliable knowledge essential in higher education. Small language models (MiniLMs), by contrast, offer distinct advantages in professional education due to their lightweight nature and precise retrieval capabilities. This research takes "Atmospheric Physics" as an example. We established a specialized corpus and image repository by gathering over 550,000 full-text PDFs from over 130 international well-respected journals in Earth and environmental science. From this collection, we extracted over 100 million high-quality sentence-level corpus and more than 3 million high-resolution academic images. Using MiniLMs, these resources were organized into a high-dimensional vector library for precise retrieval and efficient utilization of extensive educational content. Consequently, we systematically redesigned the courses, textbooks, and teaching strategies for "Atmospheric Physics" based on MiniLMs. The course is designed as a "interdisciplinary-frontier" system, breaking down traditional boundaries between atmospheric science, space science, hydrology, and remote sensing. Teaching materials are transformed from static, lagging text formats into a dynamic digital resource library powered by MiniLM. For teaching methods, we have designed a question-based learning pathway. This paradigm promotes a shift from passive knowledge transfer to active cognitive development.

Abstract: Cybersecurity's evolving complexity presents unique challenges and opportunities for AI research and practice. This paper shares key lessons and insights from designing, building, and operating production-grade GenAI pipelines in cybersecurity, with a focus on the continual adaptation required to keep pace with ever-shifting knowledge bases, tooling, and threats. Our goal is to provide an actionable perspective for AI practitioners and industry stakeholders navigating the frontier of GenAI for cybersecurity, with particular attention to how different adaptation mechanisms complement each other in end-to-end systems. We present practical guidance derived from real-world deployments, propose best practices for leveraging retrieval- and model-level adaptation, and highlight open research directions for making GenAI more robust, precise, and auditable in cyber defense.

Abstract: As agents based on large language models are increasingly deployed to long-horizon tasks, maintaining their alignment with stakeholder preferences becomes critical. Effective alignment in such settings requires reward models that are interpretable so that stakeholders can understand and audit model objectives. Moreover, reward models must be capable of steering agents at interaction time, allowing preference shifts to be incorporated without retraining. We introduce ARCANE, a framework that frames alignment as a multi-agent collaboration problem that dynamically represents stakeholder preferences as natural-language rubrics: weighted sets of verifiable criteria that can be generated on-the-fly from task context. Inspired by utility theory, we formulate rubric learning as a reconstruction problem and apply a regularized Group-Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) procedure that balances interpretability, faithfulness, and computational efficiency. Using a corpus of 219 labeled rubrics derived from the GDPVal benchmark, we evaluate ARCANE on challenging tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and tool use. The learned rubrics produce compact, legible evaluations and enable configurable trade-offs (e.g., correctness vs. conciseness) without retraining. Our results show that rubric-based reward models offer a promising path toward interpretable, test-time adaptive alignment for complex, long-horizon AI systems.

Abstract: The symbol grounding problem asks how tokens like cat can be about cats, as opposed to mere shapes manipulated in a calculus. We recast grounding from a binary judgment into an audit across desiderata, each indexed by an evaluation tuple (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution): authenticity (mechanisms reside inside the agent and, for strong claims, were acquired through learning or evolution); preservation (atomic meanings remain intact); faithfulness, both correlational (realized meanings match intended ones) and etiological (internal mechanisms causally contribute to success); robustness (graceful degradation under declared perturbations); compositionality (the whole is built systematically from the parts). We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition. By operationalizing a philosophical inquiry about representation, we equip philosophers of science, computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians with a common language and technical framework for systematic investigation of grounding and meaning.

<title>When Distance Distracts: Representation Distance Bias in BT-Loss for Reward Models</title>

Abstract: Reward models are central to Large Language Model (LLM) alignment within the framework of RLHF. The standard objective used in reward modeling is the Bradley-Terry (BT) loss, which learns from pairwise data consisting of a pair of chosen and rejected responses. In this work, we analyze the per-sample gradient of BT-loss and show that its norm scales with two distinct components: (1) the difference in predicted rewards between chosen and rejected responses, which reflects the prediction error, and critically, (2) representation distance between the pair measured in the output space of the final layer. While the first term captures the intended training signal, we show that the second term can significantly impact the update magnitude and misalign learning. Specifically, pairs with small representation distance often receive vanishingly weak updates, even when misranked, while pairs with large distance receive disproportionately strong updates. This leads to gradients from large-distance pairs to overshadow those from small-distance pairs, where fine-grained distinctions are especially important. To overcome this limitation, we propose NormBT, an adaptive pair-wise normalization scheme that balances representation-driven effects and focuses learning signals on prediction error. NormBT is a lightweight, drop-in integration to BT loss with negligible overhead. Across various LLM backbones and datasets, NormBT improves reward model performance consistently, with notable gains of over 5% on the Reasoning category of RewardBench, which contains numerous small-distance pairs. This work reveals a key limitation in the widely used BT objective and provides a simple, effective correction.

Abstract: The emergence of transformative technologies often surfaces deep societal divisions, nowhere more evident than in contemporary debates about artificial intelligence (AI). A striking feature of these divisions is that they persist despite shared interests in ensuring that AI benefits humanity and avoiding catastrophic outcomes. This paper analyzes contemporary debates about AI risk, parsing the differences between the "doomer" and "boomer" perspectives into definitional, factual, causal, and moral premises to identify key points of contention. We find that differences in perspectives about existential risk ("X-risk") arise fundamentally from differences in causal premises about design vs. emergence in complex systems, while differences in perspectives about employment risks ("E-risks") pertain to different causal premises about the applicability of past theories (evolution) vs their inapplicability (revolution). Disagreements about these two forms of AI risk appear to share two properties: neither involves significant disagreements on moral values and both can be described in terms of differing views on the extent of boundedness of human rationality. Our approach to analyzing reasoning chains at scale, using an ensemble of LLMs to parse textual data, can be applied to identify key points of contention in debates about risk to the public in any arena.

Abstract: This paper presents \textsc{Luca}, a \underline{l}arge language model (LLM)-\underline{u}pgraded graph reinforcement learning framework for \underline{c}arbon-\underline{a}ware flexible job shop scheduling. \textsc{Luca} addresses the challenges of dynamic and sustainable scheduling in smart manufacturing systems by integrating a graph neural network and an LLM, guided by a carefully designed in-house prompting strategy, to produce a fused embedding that captures both structural characteristics and contextual semantics of the latest scheduling state. This expressive embedding is then processed by a deep reinforcement learning policy network, which generates real-time scheduling decisions optimized for both makespan and carbon emission objectives. To support sustainability goals, \textsc{Luca} incorporates a dual-objective reward function that encourages both energy efficiency and scheduling timeliness. Experimental results on both synthetic and public datasets demonstrate that \textsc{Luca} consistently outperforms comparison algorithms. For instance, on the synthetic dataset, it achieves an average of 4.1\% and up to 12.2\% lower makespan compared to the best-performing comparison algorithm while maintaining the same emission level. On public datasets, additional gains are observed for both makespan and emission. These results demonstrate that \textsc{Luca} is effective and practical for carbon-aware scheduling in smart manufacturing.

<title>Less Is More for Multi-Step Logical Reasoning of LLM Generalisation Under Rule Removal, Paraphrasing, and Compression</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many natural language tasks, yet their generalisation to structural perturbations in logical contexts remains poorly understood. We introduce a controlled evaluation framework that probes reasoning reliability through four targeted stress tests: (1) rule deletion, removing either redundant or essential rules from a multi-step inference chain; (2) contradictory evidence injection; (3) logic-preserving rewrites generated through several families of equivalence laws (contrapositive, double negation, implication, De Morgan, identity, and commutativity); and (4) multi-law equivalence stacking that introduces 2-5 simultaneous logical transformations.
  Across three representative model families: BERT, Qwen2, and LLaMA-like models. Our experiments reveal a strikingly consistent pattern: all models achieve perfect accuracy on the base tasks and remain fully generalise to redundant rule deletion and all equivalence-based rewrites (single or multi-law), but fail sharply under essential rule deletion (dropping to 25% accuracy) and collapse completely in the presence of explicit contradictions (0% accuracy). These results demonstrate that LLMs possess stable invariance to semantic-preserving logical transformations, yet remain fundamentally brittle to missing or conflicting evidence. Our framework provides a clean diagnostic tool for isolating such reasoning failure modes and highlights persistent gaps in the logical generalisation abilities of current LLMs.

<title>Rethinking Training Dynamics in Scale-wise Autoregressive Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) generative models have produced increasingly powerful systems for media synthesis. Among them, next-scale prediction has emerged as a popular paradigm, where models generate images in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, scale-wise AR models suffer from exposure bias, which undermines generation quality. We identify two primary causes of this issue: (1) train-test mismatch, where the model must rely on its own imperfect predictions during inference, and (2) imbalance in scale-wise learning difficulty, where certain scales exhibit disproportionately higher optimization complexity. Through a comprehensive analysis of training dynamics, we propose Self-Autoregressive Refinement (SAR) to address these limitations. SAR introduces a Stagger-Scale Rollout (SSR) mechanism that performs lightweight autoregressive rollouts to expose the model to its own intermediate predictions, thereby aligning train-test patterns, and a complementary Contrastive Student-Forcing Loss (CSFL) that provides adequate supervision for self-generated contexts to ensure stable training. Experimental results show that applying SAR to pretrained AR models consistently improves generation quality with minimal computational overhead. For instance, SAR yields a 5.2% FID reduction on FlexVAR-d16 trained on ImageNet 256 within 10 epochs (5 hours on 32xA100 GPUs). Given its efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness, we expect SAR to serve as a reliable post-training method for visual autoregressive generation.

Abstract: Applying LLMs to predictive tasks in finance is challenging due to look-ahead bias resulting from their training on long time-series data. This precludes the backtests typically employed in finance since retraining frontier models from scratch with a specific knowledge cutoff is prohibitive. In this paper, we introduce a fast, effective, and low-cost alternative. Our method guides generation at inference time by adjusting the logits of a large base model using a pair of smaller, specialized models -- one fine-tuned on information to be forgotten and another on information to be retained. We demonstrate that our method effectively removes both verbatim and semantic knowledge, corrects biases, and outperforms prior methods.

Abstract: As web agents (e.g., Deep Research) routinely consume massive volumes of web pages to gather and analyze information, LLM context management -- under large token budgets and low signal density -- emerges as a foundational, high-importance, and technically challenging problem for agentic and RAG pipelines. Existing solutions for extracting relevant content are inadequate: generative extraction models suffer from high latency, rule-based heuristics lack adaptability, and chunk-and-rerank methods are blind to webpage structure. To overcome these issues, we introduce Index-based Web Content Extraction to reframe the extraction process from slow, token-by-token generation into a highly efficient, discriminative task of index prediction, achieving both effectiveness and efficiency. We partition HTML into structure-aware, addressable segments, and extract only the positional indices of content relevant to a given query. This method decouples extraction latency from content length, enabling rapid, query-relevant extraction. We first evaluate our method as a post-retrieval processing component within an RAG QA system and find that it improves QA accuracy. Then we directly measure its match rate with the target content in two scenarios: main content extraction (ME) and query-relevant extraction (QE). Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing works in both accuracy and speed, effectively bridging the gap between LLMs and the vast webpages.

<title>Look Twice before You Leap: A Rational Agent Framework for Localized Adversarial Anonymization</title>

Abstract: Current LLM-based text anonymization frameworks usually rely on remote API services from powerful LLMs, which creates an inherent "privacy paradox": users must somehow disclose data to untrusted third parties for superior privacy preservation. Moreover, directly migrating these frameworks to local small-scale models (LSMs) offers a suboptimal solution with catastrophic collapse in utility based on our core findings. Our work argues that this failure stems not merely from the capability deficits of LSMs, but from the inherent irrationality of the greedy adversarial strategies employed by current state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. We model the anonymization process as a trade-off between Marginal Privacy Gain (MPG) and Marginal Utility Cost (MUC), and demonstrate that greedy strategies inevitably drift into an irrational state. To address this, we propose Rational Localized Adversarial Anonymization (RLAA), a fully localized and training-free framework featuring an Attacker-Arbitrator-Anonymizer (A-A-A) architecture. RLAA introduces an arbitrator that acts as a rationality gatekeeper, validating the attacker's inference to filter out feedback providing negligible benefits on privacy preservation. This mechanism enforces a rational early-stopping criterion, and systematically prevents utility collapse. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that RLAA achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, and in some cases even outperforms SoTA on the Pareto principle. Our code and datasets will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit significant vulnerability to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks. These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated "Intent Graph"; and (ii) an innovative "Tiered Adjudicator" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are emerging to transform daily life. However, existing LLM agents primarily follow a reactive paradigm, relying on explicit user instructions to initiate services, which increases both physical and cognitive workload. In this paper, we propose ProAgent, the first end-to-end proactive agent system that harnesses massive sensory contexts and LLM reasoning to deliver proactive assistance. ProAgent first employs a proactive-oriented context extraction approach with on-demand tiered perception to continuously sense the environment and derive hierarchical contexts that incorporate both sensory and persona cues. ProAgent then adopts a context-aware proactive reasoner to map these contexts to user needs and tool calls, providing proactive assistance. We implement ProAgent on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses with an edge server and extensively evaluate it on a real-world testbed, a public dataset, and through a user study. Results show that ProAgent achieves up to 33.4% higher proactive prediction accuracy, 16.8% higher tool-calling F1 score, and notable improvements in user satisfaction over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a significant step toward proactive assistants. A video demonstration of ProAgent is available at https://youtu.be/pRXZuzvrcVs.

Abstract: Recent advances in fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable progress, particularly with the introduction of various entropy control techniques. However, the role and characteristics of entropy in perception-oriented tasks like visual grounding, as well as effective strategies for controlling it, remain largely unexplored. To address this issue, we focus on the visual grounding task and analyze the role and characteristics of entropy in comparison to reasoning tasks. Building on these findings, we introduce ECVGPO (Entropy Control Visual Grounding Policy Optimization), an interpretable algorithm designed for effective entropy regulation. Through entropy control, the trade-off between exploration and exploitation is better balanced. Experiments show that ECVGPO achieves broad improvements across various benchmarks and models.

Abstract: The paper presents the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of the ArcGD optimiser. The evaluation is conducted initially on a non-convex benchmark function and subsequently on a real-world ML dataset. The initial comparative study using the Adam optimiser is conducted on a stochastic variant of the highly non-convex and notoriously challenging Rosenbrock function, renowned for its narrow, curved valley, across dimensions ranging from 2D to 1000D and an extreme case of 50,000D. Two configurations were evaluated to eliminate learning-rate bias: (i) both using ArcGD's effective learning rate and (ii) both using Adam's default learning rate. ArcGD consistently outperformed Adam under the first setting and, although slower under the second, achieved super ior final solutions in most cases. In the second evaluation, ArcGD is evaluated against state-of-the-art optimizers (Adam, AdamW, Lion, SGD) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset across 8 diverse MLP architectures ranging from 1 to 5 hidden layers. ArcGD achieved the highest average test accuracy (50.7%) at 20,000 iterations, outperforming AdamW (46.6%), Adam (46.8%), SGD (49.6%), and Lion (43.4%), winning or tying on 6 of 8 architectures. Notably, while Adam and AdamW showed strong early convergence at 5,000 iterations, but regressed with extended training, whereas ArcGD continued improving, demonstrating generalization and resistance to overfitting without requiring early stopping tuning. Strong performance on geometric stress tests and standard deep-learning benchmarks indicates broad applicability, highlighting the need for further exploration. Moreover, it is also shown that a variant of ArcGD can be interpreted as a special case of the Lion optimiser, highlighting connections between the inherent mechanisms of such optimisation methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in video multimodal large language models (Video MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding and multi-modal interaction capabilities. While most existing systems operate in a turn-based manner where the model can only reply after user turns, proactively deciding when to reply during video playback presents a promising yet challenging direction for real-time applications. In this work, we propose a novel text-to-text approach to proactive interaction, where the model autonomously determines whether to respond or remain silent at each turn based on dialogue history and visual context up to current frame of an streaming video. To overcome difficulties in previous methods such as manually tuning response decision thresholds and annotating precise reply times, we introduce a multi-turn RL based training method that encourages timely and accurate responses without requiring precise response time annotations. We train our model MMDuet2 on a dataset of 52k videos with two types of dialogues via SFT and RL. Experimental results demonstrate that MMDuet2 outperforms existing proactive Video MLLM baselines in response timing and quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ProactiveVideoQA benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have achieved remarkable video understanding capabilities, yet face critical efficiency bottlenecks due to quadratic computational growth with lengthy visual token sequences of long videos. While existing keyframe sampling methods can improve temporal modeling efficiency, additional computational cost is introduced before feature encoding, and the binary frame selection paradigm is found suboptimal. Therefore, in this work, we propose Dynamic Token compression via LLM-guided Keyframe prior (DyToK), a training-free paradigm that enables dynamic token compression by harnessing VLLMs' inherent attention mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that VLLM attention layers naturally encoding query-conditioned keyframe priors, by which DyToK dynamically adjusts per-frame token retention ratios, prioritizing semantically rich frames while suppressing redundancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyToK achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs. DyToK shows plug-and-play compatibility with existing compression methods, such as VisionZip and FastV, attaining 4.3x faster inference while preserving accuracy across multiple VLLMs, such as LLaVA-OneVision and Qwen2.5-VL. Code is available at https://github.com/yu-lin-li/DyToK .

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in surgical video understanding. With improved zero-shot performance and more effective human-machine interaction, they provide a strong foundation for advancing surgical education and assistance. However, existing research and datasets primarily focus on understanding surgical procedures and workflows, while paying limited attention to the critical role of anatomical comprehension. In clinical practice, surgeons rely heavily on precise anatomical understanding to interpret, review, and learn from surgical videos. To fill this gap, we introduce the Neurosurgical Anatomy Benchmark (NeuroABench), the first multimodal benchmark explicitly created to evaluate anatomical understanding in the neurosurgical domain. NeuroABench consists of 9 hours of annotated neurosurgical videos covering 89 distinct procedures and is developed using a novel multimodal annotation pipeline with multiple review cycles. The benchmark evaluates the identification of 68 clinical anatomical structures, providing a rigorous and standardized framework for assessing model performance. Experiments on over 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant limitations, with the best-performing model achieving only 40.87% accuracy in anatomical identification tasks. To further evaluate the benchmark, we extract a subset of the dataset and conduct an informative test with four neurosurgical trainees. The results show that the best-performing student achieves 56% accuracy, with the lowest scores of 28% and an average score of 46.5%. While the best MLLM performs comparably to the lowest-scoring student, it still lags significantly behind the group's average performance. This comparison underscores both the progress of MLLMs in anatomical understanding and the substantial gap that remains in achieving human-level performance.

Abstract: We explore Multi-Head FFN (MH-FFN) as a replacement of FFN in the Transformer architecture, motivated by the structural similarity between single-head attention and FFN. While multi-head mechanisms enhance expressivity in attention, naively applying them to FFNs faces two challenges: memory consumption scaling with the head count, and an imbalanced ratio between the growing intermediate size and the fixed head dimension as models scale, which degrades scalability and expressive power. To address these challenges, we propose Flash Multi-Head FFN (FlashMHF), with two key innovations: an I/O-aware fused kernel computing outputs online in SRAM akin to FlashAttention, and a design using dynamically weighted parallel sub-networks to maintain a balanced ratio between intermediate and head dimensions. Validated on models from 128M to 1.3B parameters, FlashMHF consistently improves perplexity and downstream task accuracy over SwiGLU FFNs, while reducing peak memory usage by 3-5x and accelerating inference by up to 1.08x. Our work establishes the multi-head design as a superior architectural principle for FFNs, presenting FlashMHF as a powerful, efficient, and scalable alternative to FFNs in Transformers.

Abstract: Modern large language models increasingly require long contexts for reasoning and multi-document tasks, but attention's quadratic complexity creates a severe computational bottleneck. We present Block-Sparse FlashAttention (BSFA), a drop-in replacement that accelerates long-context inference while preserving model quality. Unlike methods that predict importance before computing scores, BSFA computes exact query-key similarities to select the top-k most important value blocks for each query. By comparing per-block maximum scores against calibrated thresholds, we skip approximately 50% of the computation and memory transfers for pruned blocks. Our training-free approach requires only a one-time threshold calibration on a small dataset to learn the per-layer and per-head attention score distributions. We provide a CUDA kernel implementation that can be used as a drop-in replacement for FlashAttention. On Llama-3.1-8B, BSFA achieves up to 1.10x speedup on real-world reasoning benchmarks and up to 1.24x for needle-in-a-haystack retrieval tasks while maintaining above 99% baseline accuracy, with certain configurations even improving accuracy by focusing on the most relevant content, substantially outperforming existing sparse attention methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Danielohayon/Block-Sparse-Flash-Attention

<title>A Neural Affinity Framework for Abstract Reasoning: Diagnosing the Compositional Gap in Transformer Architectures via Procedural Task Taxonomy</title>

Abstract: Responding to Hodel et al.'s (2024) call for a formal definition of task relatedness in re-arc, we present the first 9-category taxonomy of all 400 tasks, validated at 97.5% accuracy via rule-based code analysis. We prove the taxonomy's visual coherence by training a CNN on raw grid pixels (95.24% accuracy on S3, 36.25% overall, 3.3x chance), then apply the taxonomy diagnostically to the original ARC-AGI-2 test set. Our curriculum analysis reveals 35.3% of tasks exhibit low neural affinity for Transformers--a distributional bias mirroring ARC-AGI-2. To probe this misalignment, we fine-tuned a 1.7M-parameter Transformer across 302 tasks, revealing a profound Compositional Gap: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%) achieve >80% cell accuracy (local patterns) but <10% grid accuracy (global synthesis). This provides direct evidence for a Neural Affinity Ceiling Effect, where performance is bounded by architectural suitability, not curriculum. Applying our framework to Li et al.'s independent ViTARC study (400 specialists, 1M examples each) confirms its predictive power: Very Low affinity tasks achieve 51.9% versus 77.7% for High affinity (p<0.001), with a task at 0% despite massive data. The taxonomy enables precise diagnosis: low-affinity tasks (A2) hit hard ceilings, while high-affinity tasks (C1) reach 99.8%. These findings indicate that progress requires hybrid architectures with affinity-aligned modules. We release our validated taxonomy,

Abstract: As multimodal reasoning improves the overall capabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), recent studies have begun to explore safety-oriented reasoning, aiming to enhance safety awareness by analyzing potential safety risks during the reasoning process before generating the final response. Although such approaches improve safety awareness and interpretability, this single-pass think-then-answer paradigm remains vulnerable to contextual or visual jailbreak attacks. This reveals a critical flaw: single-pass reasoning may overlook explicit harmful content in its own output. Our key insight is to exploit this wasted signal through reflection, which can effectively leverage the malicious content revealed in the first-pass reasoning to enable genuine self-correction and prevent unsafe generations. Motivated by this, we propose Think-Reflect-Revise (TRR), a three-stage training framework designed to enhance the safety alignment of LVLMs through policy-guided self-reflection. We first build a Reflective Safety Reasoning (ReSafe) dataset with 5,000 examples that follow a think-reflect-revise process. We then fine-tune the target model using the ReSafe dataset to initialize reflective behavior, and finally reinforce policy-guided reflection through reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that TRR substantially improves the safety performance of LVLMs across both safety-awareness benchmarks and jailbreak attack evaluations, increasing the overall safe response rate from 42.8% to 87.7% on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, while preserving stable performance on general benchmarks such as MMMU and MMStar.

<title>PICKT: Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing for Personalized Learning using Knowledge Map Concept Relations</title>

Abstract: With the recent surge in personalized learning, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) that can accurately track students' individual knowledge states and provide tailored learning paths based on this information are in demand as an essential task. This paper focuses on the core technology of Knowledge Tracing (KT) models that analyze students' sequences of interactions to predict their knowledge acquisition levels. However, existing KT models suffer from limitations such as restricted input data formats, cold start problems arising with new student enrollment or new question addition, and insufficient stability in real-world service environments. To overcome these limitations, a Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing (PICKT) model that can effectively process multiple types of input data is proposed. Specifically, a knowledge map structures the relationships among concepts considering the question and concept text information, thereby enabling effective knowledge tracing even in cold start situations. Experiments reflecting real operational environments demonstrated the model's excellent performance and practicality. The main contributions of this research are as follows. First, a model architecture that effectively utilizes diverse data formats is presented. Second, significant performance improvements are achieved over existing models for two core cold start challenges: new student enrollment and new question addition. Third, the model's stability and practicality are validated through delicate experimental design, enhancing its applicability in real-world product environments. This provides a crucial theoretical and technical foundation for the practical implementation of next-generation ITS.

<title>Generating Storytelling Images with Rich Chains-of-Reasoning</title>

Abstract: An image can convey a compelling story by presenting rich, logically connected visual clues. These connections form Chains-of-Reasoning (CoRs) within the image, enabling viewers to infer events, causal relationships, and other information, thereby understanding the underlying story. In this paper, we focus on these semantically rich images and define them as Storytelling Images. Such images have diverse applications beyond illustration creation and cognitive screening, leveraging their ability to convey multi-layered information visually and inspire active interpretation. However, due to their complex semantic nature, Storytelling Images are inherently challenging to create, and thus remain relatively scarce. To address this challenge, we introduce the Storytelling Image Generation task, which explores how generative AI models can be leveraged to create such images. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline, StorytellingPainter, which combines the creative reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the visual synthesis capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate Storytelling Images. Alongside this pipeline, we develop a dedicated evaluation framework comprising three main evaluators: a Semantic Complexity Evaluator, a KNN-based Diversity Evaluator and a Story-Image Alignment Evaluator. Given the critical role of story generation in the Storytelling Image Generation task and the performance disparity between open-source and proprietary LLMs, we further explore tailored training strategies to reduce this gap, resulting in a series of lightweight yet effective models named Mini-Storytellers. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/xiujiesong/StorytellingImageGeneration.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the trade-off between robustness and performance for robust VLM, we observe that function words could incur vulnerability of VLMs against cross-modal adversarial attacks, and propose Function-word De-Attention (FDA) accordingly to mitigate the impact of function words. Similar to differential amplifiers, our FDA calculates the original and the function-word cross-attention within attention heads, and differentially subtracts the latter from the former for more aligned and robust VLMs. Comprehensive experiments include 2 SOTA baselines under 6 different attacks on 2 downstream tasks, 3 datasets, and 3 models. Overall, our FDA yields an average 18/13/53% ASR drop with only 0.2/0.3/0.6% performance drops on the 3 tested models on retrieval, and a 90% ASR drop with a 0.3% performance gain on visual grounding. We demonstrate the scalability, generalization, and zero-shot performance of FDA experimentally, as well as in-depth ablation studies and analysis. Code will be made publicly at https://github.com/michaeltian108/FDA.

<title>Recover-to-Forget: Gradient Reconstruction from LoRA for Efficient LLM Unlearning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.07374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlearning in large foundation models (e.g., LLMs) is essential for enabling dynamic knowledge updates, enforcing data deletion rights, and correcting model behavior. However, existing unlearning methods often require full-model fine-tuning or access to the original training data, which limits their scalability and practicality. In this work, we introduce Recover-to-Forget (R2F), a novel framework for efficient unlearning in LLMs based on reconstructing full-model gradient directions from low-rank LoRA adapter updates. Rather than performing backpropagation through the full model, we compute gradients with respect to LoRA parameters using multiple paraphrased prompts and train a gradient decoder to approximate the corresponding full-model gradients. To ensure applicability to larger or black-box models, the decoder is trained on a proxy model and transferred to target models. We provide a theoretical analysis of cross-model generalization and demonstrate that our method achieves effective unlearning while preserving general model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that R2F offers a scalable and lightweight alternative for unlearning in pretrained LLMs without requiring full retraining or access to internal parameters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess vast knowledge acquired from extensive training corpora, but they often cannot remove specific pieces of information when needed, which makes it hard to handle privacy, bias mitigation, and knowledge correction. Traditional model unlearning approaches require computationally expensive fine-tuning or direct weight editing, making them impractical for real-world deployment. In this work, we introduce LoRA-based Unlearning with Negative Examples (LUNE), a lightweight framework that performs negative-only unlearning by updating only low-rank adapters while freezing the backbone, thereby localizing edits and avoiding disruptive global changes. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), LUNE targets intermediate representations to suppress (or replace) requested knowledge with an order-of-magnitude lower compute and memory than full fine-tuning or direct weight editing. Extensive experiments on multiple factual unlearning tasks show that LUNE: (I) achieves effectiveness comparable to full fine-tuning and memory-editing methods, and (II) reduces computational cost by about an order of magnitude.

<title>Living the Novel: A System for Generating Self-Training Timeline-Aware Conversational Agents from Novels</title>

arXiv:2512.07474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Living Novel, an end-to-end system that transforms any literary work into an immersive, multi-character conversational experience. This system is designed to solve two fundamental challenges for LLM-driven characters. Firstly, generic LLMs suffer from persona drift, often failing to stay in character. Secondly, agents often exhibit abilities that extend beyond the constraints of the story's world and logic, leading to both narrative incoherence (spoiler leakage) and robustness failures (frame-breaking). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage training pipeline. Our Deep Persona Alignment (DPA) stage uses data-free reinforcement finetuning to instill deep character fidelity. Our Coherence and Robustness Enhancing (CRE) stage then employs a story-time-aware knowledge graph and a second retrieval-grounded training pass to architecturally enforce these narrative constraints. We validate our system through a multi-phase evaluation using Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. A lab study with a detailed ablation of system components is followed by a 5-day in-the-wild diary study. Our DPA pipeline helps our specialized model outperform GPT-4o on persona-specific metrics, and our CRE stage achieves near-perfect performance in coherence and robustness measures. Our study surfaces practical design guidelines for AI-driven narrative systems: we find that character-first self-training is foundational for believability, while explicit story-time constraints are crucial for sustaining coherent, interruption-resilient mobile-web experiences.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2512.07564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content plausible but incorrect claims about image content. We propose a training-free self-correction framework enabling VLMs to iteratively refine responses through uncertainty-guided visual re-attention. Our method combines multidimensional uncertainty quantification (token entropy, attention dispersion, semantic consistency, claim confidence) with attention-guided cropping of under-explored regions. Operating entirely with frozen, pretrained VLMs, our framework requires no gradient updates. We validate our approach on the POPE and MMHAL BENCH benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23] architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces hallucination rates by 9.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, while improving object existence accuracy by 4.7 points on adversarial splits. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms that uncertainty-guided re-attention successfully grounds corrections in visual evidence where standard decoding fails. We validate our approach on Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23], with plans to extend validation across diverse architectures in future versions. We release our code and methodology to facilitate future research in trustworthy multimodal systems.

arXiv:2512.07795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where reasoning, such as multi-step problem solving and chain-of-thought, is essential. Yet, current evaluation practices overwhelmingly report single-run accuracy while ignoring the intrinsic uncertainty that naturally arises from stochastic decoding. This omission creates a blind spot because practitioners cannot reliably assess whether a method's reported performance is stable, reproducible, or cost-consistent. We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning. ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting. Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability. Notably, even strategies with similar average performance can display confidence intervals up to four times wider, and the top-performing methods often incur higher and less stable costs. Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability. Our results highlight reproducibility as a critical dimension for reliable LLM reasoning and provide a foundation for future reasoning methods and uncertainty quantification techniques. ReasonBENCH is publicly available at https://github.com/au-clan/ReasonBench .

Abstract: We present GRAPE (Group RepresentAtional Position Encoding), a unified framework for positional encoding based on group actions. GRAPE brings together two families of mechanisms: (i) multiplicative rotations (Multiplicative GRAPE) in $\mathrm{SO}(d)$ and (ii) additive logit biases (Additive GRAPE) arising from unipotent actions in the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}$. In Multiplicative GRAPE, a position $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ (or $t \in \mathbb{R}$) acts as $\mathbf{G}(n)=\exp(n\,\omega\,\mathbf{L})$ with a rank-2 skew generator $\mathbf{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, yielding a relative, compositional, norm-preserving map with a closed-form matrix exponential. RoPE is recovered exactly when the $d/2$ planes are the canonical coordinate pairs with log-uniform spectrum. Learned commuting subspaces and compact non-commuting mixtures strictly extend this geometry to capture cross-subspace feature coupling at $O(d)$ and $O(r d)$ cost per head, respectively. In Additive GRAPE, additive logits arise as rank-1 (or low-rank) unipotent actions, recovering ALiBi and the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) as exact special cases while preserving an exact relative law and streaming cacheability. Altogether, GRAPE supplies a principled design space for positional geometry in long-context models, subsuming RoPE and ALiBi as special cases.

Abstract: This paper explores an intriguing observation: fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) with responses generated by a LLM often yields better results than using responses generated by humans, particularly in reasoning tasks. We conduct an in-depth investigation to understand why this occurs. Contrary to the common belief that these instances is due to the more detailed nature of LLM-generated content, our study identifies another contributing factor: an LLM is inherently more "familiar" with LLM generated responses. This familiarity is evidenced by lower perplexity before fine-tuning. We design a series of experiments to understand the impact of the "familiarity" and our conclusion reveals that this "familiarity" significantly impacts learning performance. Training with LLM-generated responses not only enhances performance but also helps maintain the model's capabilities in other reasoning tasks after fine-tuning on a specific task.

Abstract: This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method adapting phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore whether and how they relate to each other and to predict their performance characteristics. Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metric based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) exhibit significant biases in evaluation tasks, particularly in preferentially rating and favoring self-generated content. However, the extent to which this bias manifests in fact-oriented tasks, especially within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, where keyword extraction and factual accuracy take precedence over stylistic elements, remains unclear. Our study addresses this knowledge gap by simulating two critical phases of the RAG framework. In the first phase, LLMs evaluated human-authored and model-generated passages, emulating the \textit{pointwise reranking phase}. The second phase involves conducting pairwise reading comprehension tests to simulate the \textit{generation phase}. Contrary to previous findings indicating a self-preference in rating tasks, our results reveal no significant self-preference effect in RAG frameworks. Instead, we observe that factual accuracy significantly influences LLMs' output, even in the absence of prior knowledge. These findings are consistent among three common QA datasets (NQ, MARCO, TriviaQA Datasets) and 5 widely adopted language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini, LLaMA3, and Mistral). Our research contributes to the ongoing discourse on LLM biases and their implications for RAG-based system, offering insights that may inform the development of more robust and unbiased LLM systems.

Abstract: We present ZhoBLiMP, the largest linguistic minimal pair benchmark for Chinese, with over 100 paradigms, ranging from topicalization to the \textit{Ba} construction. We then train from scratch a suite of Chinese language models (LMs) with different tokenizers, parameter sizes, and token volumes, to study the learning curves of LMs on Chinese. To mitigate the biases introduced by unequal lengths of the sentences in a minimal pair, we propose a new metric named sub-linear length normalized log-probabilities (SLLN-LP). Using SLLN-LP as the metric, our results show that \textsc{Anaphor}, \textsc{Quantifiers}, and \textsc{Ellipsis} in Chinese are difficult for LMs even up to 32B parameters, and that SLLN-LP successfully mitigates biases in ZhoBLiMP, JBLiMP and BLiMP. We conclude that future evaluations should be more carefully designed to consider the intricate relations between linking functions, LMs, and targeted minimal pairs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly permeate the financial sector, there is a pressing need for a standardized method to comprehensively assess their performance. Existing financial benchmarks often suffer from limited language and task coverage, low-quality datasets, and inadequate adaptability for LLM evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce Golden Touchstone, a comprehensive bilingual benchmark for financial LLMs, encompassing eight core financial NLP tasks in both Chinese and English. Developed from extensive open-source data collection and industry-specific demands, this benchmark thoroughly assesses models' language understanding and generation capabilities. Through comparative analysis of major models such as GPT-4o, Llama3, FinGPT, and FinMA, we reveal their strengths and limitations in processing complex financial information. Additionally, we open-source Touchstone-GPT, a financial LLM trained through continual pre-training and instruction tuning, which demonstrates strong performance on the bilingual benchmark but still has limitations in specific tasks. This research provides a practical evaluation tool for financial LLMs and guides future development and optimization. The source code for Golden Touchstone and model weight of Touchstone-GPT have been made publicly available at https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/Golden-Touchstone.

Abstract: The reranker and generator are two critical components in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (i.e., RAG) pipeline, responsible for ranking relevant documents and generating responses. However, due to differences in pre-training data and objectives, there is an inevitable gap between the documents ranked as relevant by the reranker and those required by the generator to support answering the query. To address this gap, we propose RADIO, a novel and practical preference alignment framework with RAtionale DIstillatiOn. Specifically, we first propose a rationale extraction method that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the rationales necessary for answering the query. Subsequently, a rationale-based alignment process is designed to rerank the documents based on the extracted rationales, and fine-tune the reranker to align the preferences. We conduct extensive experiments on two tasks across three datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to baseline methods. Our code is released online to ease reproduction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant utility in real-world applications, exhibiting impressive capabilities in natural language processing and understanding. Benchmark evaluations are crucial for assessing the capabilities of LLMs as they can provide a comprehensive assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. However, current evaluation methods often overlook the inherent randomness of LLMs by employing deterministic generation strategies or relying on a single random sample, resulting in unaccounted sampling variance and unreliable benchmark score estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical statistical model that provides a more comprehensive representation of the benchmarking process by incorporating both benchmark characteristics and LLM randomness. We show that leveraging multiple generations improves the accuracy of estimating the benchmark score and reduces variance. Multiple generations also allow us to define $\mathbb P\left(\text{correct}\right)$, a prompt-level difficulty score based on correct ratios, providing fine-grained insights into individual prompts. Additionally, we create a data map that visualizes difficulty and semantics of prompts, enabling error detection and quality control in benchmark construction.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance, many challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the position of the layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate more stable training owing to their stronger identity path, they often lead to suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{HybridNorm}$, a simple yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. We provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence to demonstrate that HybridNorm improves the gradient flow and the model robustness. Extensive experiments on large-scale transformer models, including both dense and sparse variants, show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches across multiple benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models.

Abstract: We introduce OSVBench, a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on the task of generating complete formal specifications for verifying the functional correctness of operating system kernels. This benchmark is built upon a real-world operating system kernel, Hyperkernel, and consists of 245 complex specification generation tasks in total, each of which is a long-context task of about 20k-30k tokens. The benchmark formulates the specification generation task as a program synthesis problem confined to a domain for specifying states and transitions. This formulation is provided to LLMs through a programming model. The LLMs must be able to understand the programming model and verification assumptions before delineating the correct search space for syntax and semantics and generating formal specifications. Guided by the operating system's high-level functional description, the LLMs are asked to generate a specification that fully describes all correct states and transitions for a potentially buggy code implementation of the operating system. Experimental results with 12 state-of-the-art LLMs indicate limited performance of existing LLMs on the specification generation task for operating system verification. Significant disparities in their performance highlight differences in their ability to handle long-context code generation tasks. The code are available at https://github.com/lishangyu-hkust/OSVBench

<title>Democratic or Authoritarian? Probing a New Dimension of Political Biases in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into everyday life and information ecosystems, concerns about their implicit biases continue to persist. While prior work has primarily examined socio-demographic and left--right political dimensions, little attention has been paid to how LLMs align with broader geopolitical value systems, particularly the democracy--authoritarianism spectrum. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to assess such alignment, combining (1) the F-scale, a psychometric tool for measuring authoritarian tendencies, (2) FavScore, a newly introduced metric for evaluating model favorability toward world leaders, and (3) role-model probing to assess which figures are cited as general role-models by LLMs. We find that LLMs generally favor democratic values and leaders, but exhibit increased favorability toward authoritarian figures when prompted in Mandarin. Further, models are found to often cite authoritarian figures as role models, even outside explicit political contexts. These results shed light on ways LLMs may reflect and potentially reinforce global political ideologies, highlighting the importance of evaluating bias beyond conventional socio-political axes. Our code is available at: https://github.com/irenestrauss/Democratic-Authoritarian-Bias-LLMs.

Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed scaling laws. We argue that curvature-based approaches deepen our understanding of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities, showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Structure-inducing Language Models (SiLM) are trained on a self-supervised language modeling task, and induce a hierarchical sentence representation as a byproduct when processing an input. SiLMs couple strong syntactic generalization behavior with competitive performance on various NLP tasks, but many of their basic properties are yet underexplored. In this work, we train three different SiLM architectures from scratch: Structformer (Shen et al., 2021), UDGN (Shen et al., 2022), and GPST (Hu et al., 2024b). We train these architectures on both natural language (English, German, and Chinese) corpora and synthetic bracketing expressions. The models are then evaluated with respect to (i) properties of the induced syntactic representations (ii) performance on grammaticality judgment tasks, and (iii) training dynamics. We find that none of the three architectures dominates across all evaluation metrics. However, there are significant differences, in particular with respect to the induced syntactic representations. The Generative Pretrained Structured Transformer (GPST; Hu et al. 2024) performs most consistently across evaluation settings, and outperforms the other models on long-distance dependencies in bracketing expressions. Furthermore, our study shows that small models trained on large amounts of synthetic data provide a useful testbed for evaluating basic model properties.

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought (CoT) performance. RPRO distinguishes itself from prior approaches by employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation mechanism that aligns model outputs with established clinical workflows, while automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking optimization based on the Bradley--Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA, MedQA-USMLE, and a real-world clinical dataset from Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 2B-parameter model outperforms much larger 7B--20B models, including medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement provides a scalable and clinically grounded approach to building more reliable medical LLMs.

<title>SFT Doesn't Always Hurt General Capabilities: Revisiting Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss, including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i) using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category. For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas, for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components (e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way. We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task categories that each have distinct concepts of output homogenization. (2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is undesired, while preserving it where it is desired. (4) We challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of output homogenization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care, a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation, which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9 languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs, highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors, which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own services.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks. However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables. By building the simulator on the Matter protocol, the global industry standard for smart home communication, SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment, and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600 episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned capabilities. Our evaluation of 16 agents under a unified ReAct framework reveals distinct capabilities and limitations across models. Models under 7B parameters exhibited negligible performance across all query types. Even GPT-4.1, the best-performing standard model, struggled with implicit intent inference, state verification, and particularly temporal scheduling. While reasoning models such as GPT-5.1 consistently outperformed standard models on every query type, they required over three times the average inference time, which can be prohibitive for real-time smart home applications. This highlights a critical trade-off between task performance and real-world practicality.

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate. Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the improvement can reach up to 37\%. A python implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

<title>Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations. These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning (CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by 30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment in production systems.

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the scarcity of domain-tailored models, curated vision-language corpora, and rigorous evaluation. To address these challenges, we present the AgriGPT-VL Suite, a unified multimodal framework for agriculture. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Agri-3M-VL, the largest vision-language corpus for agriculture to our knowledge, curated by a scalable multi-agent data generator; it comprises 1M image-caption pairs, 2M image-grounded VQA pairs, 50K expert-level VQA instances, and 15K GRPO reinforcement learning samples. Second, we develop AgriGPT-VL, an agriculture-specialized vision-language model trained via a progressive curriculum of textual grounding, multimodal shallow/deep alignment, and GRPO refinement. This method achieves strong multimodal reasoning while preserving text-only capability. Third, we establish AgriBench-VL-4K, a compact yet challenging evaluation suite with open-ended and image-grounded questions, paired with multi-metric evaluation and an LLM-as-a-judge framework. Experiments show that AgriGPT-VL outperforms leading general-purpose VLMs on AgriBench-VL-4K, achieving higher pairwise win rates in the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Meanwhile, it remains competitive on the text-only AgriBench-13K with no noticeable degradation of language ability. Ablation studies further confirm consistent gains from our alignment and GRPO refinement stages. We will open source all of the resources to support reproducible research and deployment in low-resource agricultural settings.

<title>Thinking on the Fly: Test-Time Reasoning Enhancement via Latent Thought Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to more efficient latent reasoning, where intermediate thoughts are represented as vectors rather than text. However, latent reasoning can be brittle on challenging, out-of-distribution tasks where robust reasoning is most critical. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Latent Thought Policy Optimization (LTPO), a parameter-free framework that enhances LLM reasoning entirely at test time, without requiring model parameter updates. LTPO treats intermediate latent "thought" vectors as dynamic parameters that are actively optimized for each problem instance. It employs an online policy gradient method guided by an intrinsic, confidence-based reward signal computed directly from the frozen LLM's own output distributions, eliminating the need for external supervision or expensive text generation during optimization. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks show that LTPO not only matches or surpasses strong baselines on standard tasks but also demonstrates remarkable robustness where others fail. Most notably, on highly challenging AIME benchmarks where existing latent reasoning baselines collapse to near-zero accuracy, LTPO delivers substantial improvements, showcasing a unique capability for complex reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal encoders have pushed the boundaries of visual document retrieval, matching textual query tokens directly to image patches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks. Recent models relying on this paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document representations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in real-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be constrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern vision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the paradigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text retriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods, which rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the rich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we introduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method that refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a complementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual document retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric models to match the performance of models with significantly larger representations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory. Our findings show that GQR effectively pushes the Pareto frontier for performance and efficiency in multimodal retrieval. We release our code at https://github.com/IBM/test-time-hybrid-retrieval

<title>SwiReasoning: Switch-Thinking in Latent and Explicit for Pareto-Superior Reasoning LLMs</title>

Abstract: Recent work shows that, beyond discrete reasoning through explicit chain-of-thought steps, which are limited by the boundaries of natural languages, large language models (LLMs) can also reason continuously in latent space, allowing richer information per step and thereby improving token efficiency. Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges, especially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the search distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses probability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single high-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking persists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework for LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning dynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by block-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token distributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely convergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches, SwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying problem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks, SwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across reasoning LLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under constrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%, with larger gains as budgets tighten.

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

<title>Grounding Long-Context Reasoning with Contextual Normalization for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs). While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e., context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization, a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for better long-context reasoning.

Abstract: In order for large language models to achieve true conversational continuity and benefit from experiential learning, they need memory. While research has focused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which types of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We present a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods on long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering tasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context prompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic memory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory through prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches reduce token usage by over 90\% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory architecture complexity should scale with model capability, with foundation models benefitting most from RAG, and stronger instruction-tuned models gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more complex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs recognise the limits of their own knowledge.

<title>Can Fine-Tuning Erase Your Edits? On the Fragile Coexistence of Knowledge Editing and Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as a lightweight alternative to retraining for correcting or injecting specific facts in large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits (Fig.1), current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edit decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.

Abstract: We introduce SPOT (Stopping Points in Online Threads), the first annotated corpus translating the sociological concept of stopping point into a reproducible NLP task. Stopping points are ordinary critical interventions that pause or redirect online discussions through a range of forms (irony, subtle doubt or fragmentary arguments) that frameworks like counterspeech or social correction often overlook. We operationalize this concept as a binary classification task and provide reliable annotation guidelines. The corpus contains 43,305 manually annotated French Facebook comments linked to URLs flagged as false information by social media users, enriched with contextual metadata (article, post, parent comment, page or group, and source). We benchmark fine-tuned encoder models (CamemBERT) and instruction-tuned LLMs under various prompting strategies. Results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform prompted LLMs in F1 score by more than 10 percentage points, confirming the importance of supervised learning for emerging non-English social media tasks. Incorporating contextual metadata further improves encoder models F1 scores from 0.75 to 0.78. We release the anonymized dataset, along with the annotation guidelines and code in our code repository, to foster transparency and reproducible research.

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

<title>Is Self-Supervised Learning Enough to Fill in the Gap? A Study on Speech Inpainting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Speech inpainting consists in reconstructing corrupted or missing speech segments using surrounding context, a process that closely resembles the pretext tasks in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for speech encoders. This study investigates using SSL-trained speech encoders for inpainting without any additional training beyond the initial pretext task, and simply adding a decoder to generate a waveform. We compare this approach to supervised fine-tuning of speech encoders for a downstream task -- here, inpainting. Practically, we integrate HuBERT as the SSL encoder and HiFi-GAN as the decoder in two configurations: (1) fine-tuning the decoder to align with the frozen pre-trained encoder's output and (2) fine-tuning the encoder for an inpainting task based on a frozen decoder's input. Evaluations are conducted under single- and multi-speaker conditions using in-domain datasets and out-of-domain datasets (including unseen speakers, diverse speaking styles, and noise). Both informed and blind inpainting scenarios are considered, where the position of the corrupted segment is either known or unknown. The proposed SSL-based methods are benchmarked against several baselines, including a text-informed method combining automatic speech recognition with zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. Performance is assessed using objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. The results demonstrate that both approaches outperform baselines, successfully reconstructing speech segments up to 200 ms, and sometimes up to 400 ms. Notably, fine-tuning the SSL encoder achieves more accurate speech reconstruction in single-speaker settings, while a pre-trained encoder proves more effective for multi-speaker scenarios. This demonstrates that an SSL pretext task can transfer to speech inpainting, enabling successful speech reconstruction with a pre-trained encoder.

Abstract: Procedural mistake detection (PMD) is a challenging problem of classifying whether a human user (observed through egocentric video) has successfully executed a task (specified by a procedural text). Despite significant recent efforts, machine performance in the wild remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we extend PMD to require generating visual self-dialog rationales to inform decisions. Given the impressive, mature image understanding capabilities observed in recent vision-and-language models (VLMs), we curate a suitable benchmark dataset for PMD based on individual frames. As our reformulation enables unprecedented transparency, we leverage a natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated metrics for the coherence of generated rationales. We establish baselines for this reframed task, showing that VLMs struggle off-the-shelf, but with some trade-offs, their accuracy, coherence, and efficiency can be improved by incorporating these metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods. Lastly, our multi-faceted metrics visualize common outcomes, highlighting areas for further improvement.

Abstract: While the advancement of large language models has spurred the development of AI agents to automate tasks, numerous use cases inherently require agents to collaborate with humans due to humans' latent preferences, domain expertise, or the need for control. To facilitate the study of human-agent collaboration, we introduce Collaborative Gym (Co-Gym), an open framework for developing and evaluating collaborative agents that engage in bidirectional communication with humans while interacting with task environments. We describe how the framework enables the implementation of new task environments and coordination between humans and agents through a flexible, non-turn-taking interaction paradigm, along with an evaluation suite that assesses both collaboration outcomes and processes. Our framework provides both a simulated condition with a reliable user simulator and a real-world condition with an interactive web application. Initial benchmark experiments across three representative tasks -- creating travel plans, writing related work sections, and analyzing tabular data -- demonstrate the benefits of human-agent collaboration: The best-performing collaborative agents consistently outperform their fully autonomous counterparts in task performance, achieving win rates of 86% in Travel Planning, 74% in Tabular Analysis, and 66% in Related Work when evaluated by real users. Despite these improvements, our evaluation reveals persistent limitations in current language models and agents, with communication and situational awareness failures observed in 65% and 40% of cases in the real condition, respectively. Released under the permissive MIT license, Co-Gym supports the addition of new task environments and can be used to develop collaborative agent applications, while its evaluation suite enables assessment and improvement of collaborative agents.

Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.

Abstract: Encoder-free architectures have been preliminarily explored in the 2D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet it remains an open question whether they can be effectively applied to 3D understanding scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to alleviate the challenges of encoder-based 3D LMMs. These long-standing challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud resolutions during inference and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic needs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to remove the pre-trained encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1) We propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training stage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And we present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract high-level semantics. 2) We introduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction tuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM layers to focus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the first Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL. Our 7B model rivals the state-of-the-art model, PointLLM-PiSA-13B, achieving 57.91%, 61.0%, and 55.20% on the classification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively. Our results show that the encoder-free architecture is highly promising for replacing encoder-based architectures in the field of 3D understanding.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Alignment (MOA) aims to align LLMs' responses with multiple human preference objectives, with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) emerging as a prominent approach. However, we find that DPO-based MOA approaches suffer from widespread preference conflicts in the data, where different objectives favor different responses. This results in conflicting optimization directions, hindering the optimization on the Pareto Front. To address this, we propose to construct Pareto-optimal responses to resolve preference conflicts. To efficiently obtain and utilize such responses, we propose a self-improving DPO framework that enables LLMs to self-generate and select Pareto-optimal responses for self-supervised preference alignment. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the superior Pareto Front achieved by our framework compared to various baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/zyttt-coder/SIPO.

Abstract: Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training. Our code, data, and models are released at https://github.com/mukhal/thinkprm.

<title>Beyond Markovian: Reflective Exploration via Bayes-Adaptive RL for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and emergent reflective behaviors, such as rethinking and error correction, as a form of in-context exploration. However, the Markovian policy obtained from conventional RL training does not give rise to reflective exploration behaviors since the policy depends on the history only through the state and therefore has no incentive to enrich identical states with additional context. Instead, RL exploration is only useful during training to learn the optimal policy in a trial-and-error manner. Therefore, it remains unclear whether reflective reasoning will emerge during RL, or why it is beneficial. To remedy this, we recast reflective exploration within a Bayesian RL framework, which optimizes the expected return under a posterior distribution over Markov decision processes induced by the training data. This Bayesian formulation admits uncertainty-adaptive policies that, through belief updates, naturally incentivize information-gathering actions and induce self-reflection behaviors. Our resulting algorithm, BARL, instructs the LLM to stitch and switch strategies based on the observed outcomes, offering principled guidance on when and how the model should reflectively explore. Empirical results on both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that BARL outperforms conventional RL approaches, achieving superior test-time performance and token efficiency.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment, which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks designed to test generalization and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering (SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors, including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\% on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to 48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points, 2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing interpretability research.

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress, existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i) For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length, finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO) policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn agentic RL.

<title>General Exploratory Bonus for Optimistic Exploration in RLHF</title>

Abstract: Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.

Abstract: The computational role of imagination remains debated. While classical accounts emphasize reward maximization, emerging evidence suggests imagination serves a broader function: accessing internal world models (IWMs). Here, we employ psychological network analysis to compare IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs) through imagination vividness ratings. Using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2) and Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (PSIQ), we construct imagination networks from three human populations (Florida, Poland, London; N=2,743) and six LLM variants in two conversation conditions. Human imagination networks demonstrate robust correlations across centrality measures (expected influence, strength, closeness) and consistent clustering patterns, indicating shared structural organization of IWMs across populations. In contrast, LLM-derived networks show minimal clustering and weak centrality correlations, even when manipulating conversational memory. These systematic differences persist across environmental scenes (VVIQ-2) and sensory modalities (PSIQ), revealing fundamental disparities between human and artificial world models. Our network-based approach provides a quantitative framework for comparing internally-generated representations across cognitive agents, with implications for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence systems.

<title>PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions</title>

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr, SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable, interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics (including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus, DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type (using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as assistive text generation.

<title>Aligning Machiavellian Agents: Behavior Steering via Test-Time Policy Shaping</title>

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining alignment. For pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

<title>A Content-Preserving Secure Linguistic Steganography</title>

Abstract: Existing linguistic steganography methods primarily rely on content transformations to conceal secret messages. However, they often cause subtle yet looking-innocent deviations between normal and stego texts, posing potential security risks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a content-preserving linguistic steganography paradigm for perfectly secure covert communication without modifying the cover text. Based on this paradigm, we introduce CLstega (\textit{C}ontent-preserving \textit{L}inguistic \textit{stega}nography), a novel method that embeds secret messages through controllable distribution transformation. CLstega first applies an augmented masking strategy to locate and mask embedding positions, where MLM(masked language model)-predicted probability distributions are easily adjustable for transformation. Subsequently, a dynamic distribution steganographic coding strategy is designed to encode secret messages by deriving target distributions from the original probability distributions. To achieve this transformation, CLstega elaborately selects target words for embedding positions as labels to construct a masked sentence dataset, which is used to fine-tune the original MLM, producing a target MLM capable of directly extracting secret messages from the cover text. This approach ensures perfect security of secret messages while fully preserving the integrity of the original cover text. Experimental results show that CLstega can achieve a 100\% extraction success rate, and outperforms existing methods in security, effectively balancing embedding capacity and security.

<title>The Oracle and The Prism: A Decoupled and Efficient Framework for Generative Recommendation Explanation</title>

arXiv:2511.16543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into explainable recommendation systems often leads to a performance-efficiency trade-off in end-to-end architectures, where joint optimization of ranking and explanation can result in suboptimal compromises. To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.
  Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful, instruction-following teacher LLM (FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets reveal a key finding: the distillation process not only transfers knowledge but also acts as a noise filter. Our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, demonstrating an emergent ability to correct hallucinations present in the teacher's outputs. While achieving a 24x speedup and a 10x reduction in memory consumption, our analysis validates that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality, and perhaps more importantly, trustworthy explainable recommendation.

<div> Keywords: scientific question answering, BERT fine-tuning, educational domain, university course materials, QA chatbot<br /><br />Summary: Prior research in scientific question answering has mainly focused on chatbot-type systems, with limited work on fine-tuning foundational language models for specialized domain reasoning. This study presents the development of a chatbot tailored specifically for the University of Limerick's Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering to assist students by providing course-related information. A custom dataset was created comprising 1,203 question-answer pairs formatted similarly to SQuAD, derived primarily from the university's official book of modules, and enhanced with both manually and synthetically generated entries. The BERT language model was fine-tuned using the PyTorch framework and evaluated by standard metrics such as Exact Match and F1 scores. The results demonstrated that even modest fine-tuning improves the model’s ability to accurately frame hypotheses and extract relevant knowledge from the dataset. Unlike existing domain-specific BERT variants like BioBERT and SciBERT, which target biomedical and scientific literature respectively, no model had previously been adapted expressly for university course materials. This work fills that gap by proving that fine-tuning BERT with academic question-answer pairs can yield effective domain-specific performance. The findings suggest promising prospects for scaling such models to create autonomous educational knowledge systems for universities. <div>

Abstract: Prior work on scientific question answering has largely emphasized chatbot-style systems, with limited exploration of fine-tuning foundation models for domain-specific reasoning. In this study, we developed a chatbot for the University of Limerick's Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering to provide course information to students. A custom dataset of 1,203 question-answer pairs in SQuAD format was constructed using the university book of modules, supplemented with manually and synthetically generated entries. We fine-tuned BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) using PyTorch and evaluated performance with Exact Match and F1 scores. Results show that even modest fine-tuning improves hypothesis framing and knowledge extraction, demonstrating the feasibility of adapting foundation models to educational domains. While domain-specific BERT variants such as BioBERT and SciBERT exist for biomedical and scientific literature, no foundation model has yet been tailored to university course materials. Our work addresses this gap by showing that fine-tuning BERT with academic QA pairs yields effective results, highlighting the potential to scale towards the first domain-specific QA model for universities and enabling autonomous educational knowledge systems.

<br /><br />Summary:  
This article addresses the rising issue of polarized discourse globally and introduces a novel method to quantify polarization based on the emotional style of communication rather than ideological differences. The method employs psychological measures of Valence (positivity-negativity), Arousal (intensity of emotion), and Dominance (control in emotion expression) to detect affective polarization signals in discourse. The researchers apply this approach specifically to a newly available corpus containing the proceedings of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, conducted in Hebrew. Their analysis reveals distinct emotional styles between members of the government and the opposition, indicating that emotional expression varies depending on political alignment. Furthermore, the study finds a significant upward trend in affective polarization over time, suggesting that emotional divides in parliamentary communication are deepening. This approach offers a fresh perspective by focusing on affective dimensions rather than purely ideological content, providing valuable insights into how political polarization manifests emotionally in legislative dialogues. The findings suggest potential implications for understanding the dynamics of political conflict and social cohesion within parliamentary environments. <div>

Abstract: Recent years have seen an increase in polarized discourse worldwide, on various platforms. We propose a novel method for quantifying polarization, based on the emotional style of the discourse rather than on differences in ideological stands. Using measures of Valence, Arousal and Dominance, we detect signals of emotional discourse and use them to operationalize the concept of affective polarization. Applying this method to a recently released corpus of proceedings of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament (in Hebrew), we find that the emotional style of members of government differs from that of opposition members; and that the level of affective polarization, as reflected by this style, is significantly increasing with time.

It proposes that integrating poetic prompts can enrich the prompt engineer’s methods by providing novel ways to interact with and assess LLMs. The paper outlines a systematic approach to applying poetic prompts for prompt engineering purposes. It then tests this approach by using poetic prompts to generate descriptions and evaluations of three different models of a famous poet, examining how LLMs interpret and recreate established creative works. Furthermore, the study investigates the effects of models’ readiness to adapt or rewrite original creative content, considering the implications of tailoring outputs for different or presumed audiences. Overall, the research advocates for creative text prompting, especially poetry-based techniques, as a valuable tool to deepen the understanding and practical application of LLMs in both creative and analytical contexts. <div>

Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as a useful way studying the algorithmic tendencies and biases of large language models. Meanwhile creatives and academics have leveraged LLMs to develop creative works and explore the boundaries of their writing capabilities through text generation and code. This study suggests that creative text prompting, specifically Poetry Prompt Patterns, may be a useful addition to the toolbox of the prompt engineer, and outlines the process by which this approach may be taken. Then, the paper uses poetic prompts to assess descriptions and evaluations of three models of a renowned poet and test the consequences of the willingness of models to adapt or rewrite original creative works for presumed audiences.

<div> Keywords: electronic health records, clinical notes, large language models, Chain-of-Thought prompting, knowledge graph<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />In the last decade, the volume of electronic health record (EHR) data in the U.S. has grown significantly, driven by supportive policies such as the HITECH Act of 2009 and the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016. Physicians document patient assessments, diagnoses, and treatments in free-text clinical notes within EHRs, a process that consumes considerable time and may delay patient care. Large language models (LLMs), known for generating human-like text, have potential to automate clinical note generation. This study explores the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt engineering to enhance LLM performance in generating clinical notes. The method uses input data including International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and basic patient information. The approach integrates traditional CoT prompting with semantic search results to improve note quality. Additionally, a clinical knowledge graph (KG) derived from clinical ontology was infused to enrich domain-specific knowledge in the generated notes. Experiments were conducted on six clinical cases from the CodiEsp test dataset using GPT-4. The proposed prompting technique with CoT, semantic search, and KG integration outperformed standard one-shot prompting methods in generating higher quality clinical notes. <div>

Abstract: In the past decade a surge in the amount of electronic health record (EHR) data in the United States, attributed to a favorable policy environment created by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 and the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016. Clinical notes for patients' assessments, diagnoses, and treatments are captured in these EHRs in free-form text by physicians, who spend a considerable amount of time entering and editing them. Manually writing clinical notes takes a considerable amount of a doctor's valuable time, increasing the patient's waiting time and possibly delaying diagnoses. Large language models (LLMs) possess the ability to generate news articles that closely resemble human-written ones. We investigate the usage of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt engineering to improve the LLM's response in clinical note generation. In our prompts, we use as input International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and basic patient information. We investigate a strategy that combines the traditional CoT with semantic search results to improve the quality of generated clinical notes. Additionally, we infuse a knowledge graph (KG) built from clinical ontology to further enrich the domain-specific knowledge of generated clinical notes. We test our prompting technique on six clinical cases from the CodiEsp test dataset using GPT-4 and our results show that it outperformed the clinical notes generated by standard one-shot prompts.

<div> Chain-of-thought, few-shot learning, meta-training, in-context learning, symbolic reasoning<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the limitations of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting combined with few-shot in-context learning (ICL) for large language models (LLMs) when applied to novel tasks with insufficient pre-training knowledge. The authors introduce the CoT-ICL Lab framework to study this problem in a controlled environment and propose meta-training techniques designed to help models learn new abstract reasoning tasks in-context. They observe that although CoT examples aid reasoning, an excessive amount during meta-training can degrade performance when CoT supervision is scarce. To solve this, they introduce CoT-Recipe, a formal method that modulates the ratio of CoT and non-CoT examples in meta-training sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that using CoT-Recipe can improve transformer accuracy on novel tasks by up to 300%, even when no CoT examples are present during in-context inference. Furthermore, when applying these meta-training modulation techniques to pretrained LLMs such as the Qwen2.5 series for symbolic reasoning tasks, accuracy gains of up to 130% are observed. Overall, the work highlights the importance of balanced meta-training data and presents a practical approach to enhance generalization of reasoning abilities in LLMs under low CoT supervision scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting combined with few-shot in-context learning (ICL) has unlocked significant reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, ICL with CoT examples is ineffective on novel tasks when the pre-training knowledge is insufficient. We study this problem in a controlled setting using the CoT-ICL Lab framework, and propose meta-training techniques to learn novel abstract reasoning tasks in-context. Although CoT examples facilitate reasoning, we noticed that their excessive inclusion during meta-training degrades performance when CoT supervision is limited. To mitigate such behavior, we propose CoT-Recipe, a formal approach to modulate the mix of CoT and non-CoT examples in meta-training sequences. We demonstrate that careful modulation via CoT-Recipe can increase the accuracy of transformers on novel tasks by up to 300% even when there are no CoT examples available in-context. We confirm the broader effectiveness of these techniques by applying them to pretrained LLMs (Qwen2.5 series) for symbolic reasoning tasks and observing gains of up to 130% in accuracy.

<div> Keywords: large reasoning models, early-exit mechanism, LYNX, confidence-controlled stopping, token efficiency  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the issue of "overthinking" in large reasoning models, where models continue to generate extended chains of thought even after obtaining sufficient information to answer correctly, leading to wasted compute and potential accuracy drops. The authors propose LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that leverages a model's hidden-state awareness by attaching exit decisions to natural reasoning cues (e.g., "hmm", "wait") within the generated text. LYNX trains a lightweight probe on these hidden states supervised by forced exit data and applies split conformal prediction to maintain distribution-free confidence guarantees on stopping decisions. The probe is trained once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuses the same model across various benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and different task domains, including non-mathematical tasks. Experimental results across three model families (ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters) demonstrate that LYNX can significantly reduce token usage—by 40-70%—while maintaining or improving accuracy on multiple benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME 2024, and CommonsenseQA. Compared to existing early-exit methods, LYNX achieves competitive or superior performance, is fully online (no need for auxiliary verifier models), and offers explicit user-tunable confidence controls, making it an effective and efficient solution for early stopping in reasoning models. <div>

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought, but they often "overthink": continuing to reason long after they have enough information to answer correctly. This wastes inference-time compute and can hurt accuracy. Existing attempts to stop early either manipulate decoding with extra sampling and heuristics, rely on auxiliary verifier models, or operate only as post-hoc analysis pipelines without formal guarantees. We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., "hmm", "wait") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\% fewer tokens. Compared to state-of-the-art early-exit methods, LYNX offers competitive or superior Pareto frontiers while remaining fully online, requiring no proxy models at inference, and providing explicit, user-tunable confidence guarantees.

<div> Pink Slime Journalism, local news, large language models, adversarial attacks, detection systems<br /><br />Summary:  
The study addresses the growing threat of Pink Slime Journalism, which consists of low-quality, auto-generated articles that imitate legitimate local news and impact 28 million Americans relying on these sources. The research conducts an in-depth analysis of the linguistic, stylistic, and lexical features that differentiate Pink Slime content from genuine reporting. A key contribution is identifying a new adversarial tactic where large language models (LLMs) modify Pink Slime articles, making detection significantly more difficult. The study demonstrates that even widely accessible consumer LLMs can reduce existing detection systems’ effectiveness by as much as 40% in F1-score. To mitigate this challenge, the authors propose a robust learning framework tailored to withstand LLM-based adversarial manipulation and adapt to continuous evolution within automated local news content. The framework shows promising results, achieving up to a 27% improvement in detection performance, indicating its potential to safeguard the local news landscape from deceptive, machine-generated misinformation. <div>

Abstract: The local news landscape, a vital source of reliable information for 28 million Americans, faces a growing threat from Pink Slime Journalism, a low-quality, auto-generated articles that mimic legitimate local reporting. Detecting these deceptive articles requires a fine-grained analysis of their linguistic, stylistic, and lexical characteristics. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study to uncover the distinguishing patterns of Pink Slime content and propose detection strategies based on these insights. Beyond traditional generation methods, we highlight a new adversarial vector: modifications through large language models (LLMs). Our findings reveal that even consumer-accessible LLMs can significantly undermine existing detection systems, reducing their performance by up to 40% in F1-score. To counter this threat, we introduce a robust learning framework specifically designed to resist LLM-based adversarial attacks and adapt to the evolving landscape of automated pink slime journalism, and showed and improvement by up to 27%.

<div> Keywords: hybrid neural-symbolic methods, morphological complexity, Sanskrit evolution, weak supervision, confidence-weighted ensemble  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study explores the application of hybrid neural-symbolic methods to analyze the evolution of Sanskrit, a morphologically rich and low-resource language, across more than 2,000 years. It challenges the prevalent assumption that linguistic change equates to simplification by demonstrating that morphological complexity in Sanskrit does not simply decrease but instead redistributes dynamically over time. The approach uses weak supervision, employing over 100 high-precision regex patterns to create pseudo-labels for fine-tuning a multilingual BERT model, thereby effectively addressing the scarcity of annotated data. A novel confidence-weighted ensemble method fuses symbolic and neural outputs, resulting in a system that is both scalable and interpretable. When applied to a large diachronic corpus of 1.47 million words, this ensemble achieves a 52.4% overall feature detection rate. The research uncovers cyclical declines in certain verbal morphological features while showing increased complexity in other linguistic areas, including a rise in compound formations and novel philosophical vocabulary. Importantly, the system yields well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, with confidence scores strongly correlating with accuracy (Pearson r = 0.92) and demonstrating low expected calibration error (ECE = 0.043), which enhances the dependability of computational philological insights derived from this work. <div>

Abstract: This study demonstrates how hybrid neural-symbolic methods can yield significant new insights into the evolution of a morphologically rich, low-resource language. We challenge the naive assumption that linguistic change is simplification by quantitatively analyzing over 2,000 years of Sanskrit, demonstrating how weakly-supervised hybrid methods can yield new insights into the evolution of morphologically rich, low-resource languages. Our approach addresses data scarcity through weak supervision, using 100+ high-precision regex patterns to generate pseudo-labels for fine-tuning a multilingual BERT. We then fuse symbolic and neural outputs via a novel confidence-weighted ensemble, creating a system that is both scalable and interpretable. Applying this framework to a 1.47-million-word diachronic corpus, our ensemble achieves a 52.4% overall feature detection rate. Our findings reveal that Sanskrit's overall morphological complexity does not decrease but is instead dynamically redistributed: while earlier verbal features show cyclical patterns of decline, complexity shifts to other domains, evidenced by a dramatic expansion in compounding and the emergence of new philosophical terminology. Critically, our system produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, with confidence strongly correlating with accuracy (Pearson r = 0.92) and low overall calibration error (ECE = 0.043), bolstering the reliability of these findings for computational philology.

<div> self-preference, language model judges, bias mitigation, synonym replacement, stylistic differences<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Language model (LM) judges are commonly used to evaluate the quality of outputs generated by language models, but they exhibit biases that can undermine evaluation integrity.<br />2. A notable bias identified is self-preference, where LM judges favor their own generated answers over those created by other models or humans.<br />3. This bias is difficult to remove because advanced LM judges can recognize their own outputs even when evaluation samples are anonymized.<br />4. The study investigates ways to reduce self-preference by obstructing the LM judges’ ability to detect their own authorship through black-box perturbations applied to comparison candidates.<br />5. Simple perturbations such as replacing a few words with synonyms reliably decrease self-preference, indicating initial success in bias mitigation.<br />6. However, the researchers find a fundamental challenge: when stylistic differences between evaluation candidates are almost entirely neutralized, the self-preference bias resurfaces.<br />7. This implies that self-recognition and self-preference may be operating on multiple semantic levels, not just surface features.<br />8. Consequently, fully eliminating self-preference bias in LM judges remains a challenging problem despite the promising results from perturbation strategies. <div>
arXiv:2512.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) judges are widely used to evaluate the quality of LM outputs. Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations. One such bias is self-preference: LM judges preferring their own answers over those produced by other LMs or humans. The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers. Our findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference can happen on many semantic levels, and complete mitigation remains challenging despite promising initial results.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, hallucination, self-supervised learning, summarization, preference optimization  

<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations, producing content not grounded in the input during long-form text generation tasks like summarization. Prior solutions to this issue involve iterative critique and refinement using either the same model or a more powerful teacher model, but these methods are computationally expensive or depend on access to stronger models, limiting practicality. To address these limitations, the paper proposes Self Critique and Refinement-based Preference Optimization (SCRPO), a self-supervised training framework. SCRPO constructs a preference dataset by leveraging the LLM’s intrinsic critique and refinement abilities and uses preference learning to enhance the LLM’s faithfulness in summarization. The approach was experimentally validated on three popular summarization benchmarks: XSUM, CNNDM, and SAMSum. Results show that SCRPO outperforms existing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning techniques regarding faithfulness metrics while maintaining or improving overall summary quality metrics. Furthermore, compared to test-time refinement methods, SCRPO improves computational efficiency and generates more faithful summaries, making it a practical and effective solution to reduce hallucinations in LLM-generated summaries. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucinations: output content that is not grounded in the input context, when performing long-form text generation tasks such as summarization. Prior works have shown that hallucinations can be reduced by iteratively critiquing and refining previously generated outputs using either the same model or a more powerful teacher model as the critique. However, these approaches either require additional test-time compute or assume access to more powerful teacher models, making them costly and less practical. In this work, we propose Self Critique and Refinement-based Preference Optimization (SCRPO), which is a self-supervised training framework that first constructs a preference dataset by leveraging the LLM's own critique and refinement capabilities, and then applies preference learning to improve the same LLM for faithful summarization. Experiments on three summarization benchmarks (XSUM CNNDM and SAMSum), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods in terms of faithfulness metrics while either maintaining or improving other metrics that measure the overall quality of the summary. Moreover, compared to test-time refinement, our approach not only improves efficiency but also results in more faithful summaries.

<div> Sparse-Quantized Format (SQ-format), Post-training quantization (PTQ), Large language models (LLMs), Low-bit quantization, Hardware acceleration  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of balancing accuracy and efficiency in post-training quantization (PTQ) for large language models (LLMs), particularly when using low-bit quantization and sparsification techniques. Existing methods like W4A8 fail to improve peak tera operations per second (TOPS) beyond W8A8, and hardware-supported sparse formats such as 2:4 semi-structured sparsity suffer from accuracy loss, limiting their adoption. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel Sparse-Quantized Format (SQ-format), a unified data representation that integrates quantization and sparsification while being compatible with both new hardware designs and existing GPUs. The SQ-format leverages the acceleration of sparse matrices in high precision alongside efficient low-precision matrix multiplication, enabling a Pareto improvement by enhancing both performance and throughput. It is especially effective for activations characterized by outlier inequality, allowing for static compression of such activations. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art PTQ results using SQ-format, outlines necessary hardware support to optimize its performance, and presents design explorations and insights aimed at guiding the development of the next generation of AI accelerators. <div>
arXiv:2512.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) plays a crucial role in the democratization of large language models (LLMs). However, existing low-bit quantization and sparsification techniques are difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency due to the limited hardware support. For example, W4A8 can only achieve the same peak TOPS as W8A8 whereas the GPU-supported sparse data format (2:4 semi-structure sparse) is seldomly adopted due to the loss of accuracy. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose the Sparse-Quantized Format (SQ-format), which is a unified data format for quantization and sparsification potentially easily supported by new hardware and existing GPUs. SQ-format makes use of the fact that sparse matrix can be accelerated in high-precision, and low-precision matrix multiplication can also be accelerated accordingly. As such, SQ-format is proposed to achieve Pareto improvement between performance and throughput. This format is particularly suitable for activations with outlier inequality status and makes their static compression possible. We show the state-of-the-art PTQ performance with SQ-format, propose the hardware required to support it, and further offer the design exploration and insights for the next-generation AI accelerators.

<div> Keywords: spell correction, low-resource languages, pretrained language models, large language models, LMSpell<br /><br />Summary: This study addresses the challenge of spell correction in low-resource languages (LRLs), an area with limited research despite the availability of pretrained language models (PLMs). The authors conduct the first comprehensive empirical comparison of various PLMs—encoder-based, encoder-decoder, and large language models (LLMs)—for spell correction tasks, including for LRLs. Their findings reveal that LLMs outperform other model types when trained on sufficiently large fine-tuning datasets. Notably, this superior performance of LLMs extends even to languages that were not part of the model’s original pretraining. To support the research community and practitioners, the authors release LMSpell, a user-friendly spell correction toolkit compatible with multiple PLMs. LMSpell also features an evaluation function specifically designed to mitigate hallucination effects commonly observed in LLM outputs. Additionally, the paper presents a focused case study on Sinhala, a low-resource language, to exemplify the unique challenges faced in spell correction within such linguistic contexts. Overall, this work provides valuable insights and practical tools to advance spell correction efforts for low-resource languages using modern language modeling techniques. <div>
arXiv:2512.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spell correction is still a challenging problem for low-resource languages (LRLs). While pretrained language models (PLMs) have been employed for spell correction, their use is still limited to a handful of languages, and there has been no proper comparison across PLMs. We present the first empirical study on the effectiveness of PLMs for spell correction, which includes LRLs. We find that Large Language Models (LLMs) outperform their counterparts (encoder-based and encoder-decoder) when the fine-tuning dataset is large. This observation holds even in languages for which the LLM is not pre-trained. We release LMSpell, an easy- to use spell correction toolkit across PLMs. It includes an evaluation function that compensates for the hallucination of LLMs. Further, we present a case study with Sinhala to shed light on the plight of spell correction for LRLs.

<div> Keywords: large language models, music question answering, MusWikiDB, retrieval-augmented generation, ArtistMus  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced open-domain question answering but face challenges in music-related reasoning due to limited music knowledge in training data. To address this, the authors introduce MusWikiDB, a specialized vector database containing 3.2 million passages from 144,000 music-related Wikipedia pages. Alongside this, they present ArtistMus, a benchmark dataset comprising 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists enriched with metadata like genre, debut year, and topics. These resources enable rigorous evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques tailored for music question answering (MQA). Experimental results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances factual accuracy, with open-source models (e.g., Qwen3 8B) improving by up to +56.8 percentage points, nearing the performance of proprietary models. Moreover, RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, benefiting in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. The MusWikiDB corpus outperforms general-purpose Wikipedia databases by approximately 6 percentage points in accuracy and offers 40% faster retrieval. The release of MusWikiDB and ArtistMus aims to foster research at the intersection of music information retrieval and domain-specific question answering, setting the stage for effective retrieval-augmented reasoning in culturally rich domains such as music. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have transformed open-domain question answering, yet their effectiveness in music-related reasoning remains limited due to sparse music knowledge in pretraining data. While music information retrieval and computational musicology have explored structured and multimodal understanding, few resources support factual and contextual music question answering (MQA) grounded in artist metadata or historical context. We introduce MusWikiDB, a vector database of 3.2M passages from 144K music-related Wikipedia pages, and ArtistMus, a benchmark of 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists with metadata such as genre, debut year, and topic. These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus. We release MusWikiDB and ArtistMus to advance research in music information retrieval and domain-specific question answering, establishing a foundation for retrieval-augmented reasoning in culturally rich domains such as music.

<div> Large Language Models, Alignment, Collective Agency, Dynamic Alignment, Self-rewarding mechanism<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the limitations of traditional alignment methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), which rely heavily on human feedback and predefined value principles such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. These approaches are resource-intensive and may not scale effectively as AI advances toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).<br /><br />2. The authors propose a new, more holistic alignment objective called Collective Agency (CA), which represents a unified and open-ended value system designed to foster integrated agentic capabilities beyond conventional alignment norms.<br /><br />3. To achieve scalable and iterative self-alignment, they introduce a novel alignment framework named Dynamic Alignment. This framework allows the LLM to self-improve by repeatedly refining its alignment through an automated process.<br /><br />4. Dynamic Alignment consists of two main components: first, automated generation of training datasets using LLMs themselves; and second, a self-rewarding mechanism, where the policy model evaluates its own outputs and assigns rewards, enabling learning via GRPO (Generalized Policy Reward Optimization).<br /><br />5. Experimental evaluations show that this approach effectively aligns the model to the Collective Agency value system without sacrificing its general natural language processing capabilities, demonstrating a promising pathway for scalable and comprehensive LLM alignment. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically aligned with human values using preference data or predefined principles such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. However, as AI systems progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), such value systems may become insufficient. In addition, human feedback-based alignment remains resource-intensive and difficult to scale. While AI-feedback-based self-improving alignment methods have been explored as a scalable alternative, they have largely remained constrained to conventional alignment values. In this work, we explore both a more holistic alignment objective and a scalable, self-improving alignment approach. Aiming to transcend conventional alignment norms, we introduce Collective Agency (CA)-a unified and open-ended alignment value that encourages integrated agentic capabilities. We also propose Dynamic Alignment-an alignment framework that enables an LLM to iteratively align itself. Dynamic Alignment comprises two key components: (1) automated training dataset generation with LLMs, and (2) a self-rewarding mechanism, where the policy model evaluates its own output candidates and assigns rewards for GRPO-based learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully aligns the model to CA while preserving general NLP capabilities.

<div> Southeast Asian languages, multilingual safety benchmarks, large language models, harm detection, cultural diversity<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Safeguard models are designed to help large language models (LLMs) detect and block harmful content effectively. However, current evaluations tend to be English-focused, often neglecting the linguistic and cultural diversity present in other languages.  
2. Many existing multilingual safety benchmarks use machine-translated English data, which does not accurately represent the nuances and specific challenges found in low-resource languages.  
3. Southeast Asian (SEA) languages are notably underrepresented in safety research, despite the region's rich linguistic diversity and unique safety concerns such as culturally sensitive political speech and region-specific misinformation.  
4. To address these shortcomings, SEA-SafeguardBench was introduced as the first human-verified safety benchmark specifically for SEA languages. It includes data from eight languages and comprises 21,640 samples, organized into three subsets: general content, in-the-wild scenarios, and content generation tasks.  
5. Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs and their associated safety guardrails face significant challenges when dealing with SEA cultural contexts and harm scenarios, underperforming on these languages compared to English texts. This emphasizes the need for more culturally aware and linguistically diverse safety evaluation benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2512.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safeguard models help large language models (LLMs) detect and block harmful content, but most evaluations remain English-centric and overlook linguistic and cultural diversity. Existing multilingual safety benchmarks often rely on machine-translated English data, which fails to capture nuances in low-resource languages. Southeast Asian (SEA) languages are underrepresented despite the region's linguistic diversity and unique safety concerns, from culturally sensitive political speech to region-specific misinformation. Addressing these gaps requires benchmarks that are natively authored to reflect local norms and harm scenarios. We introduce SEA-SafeguardBench, the first human-verified safety benchmark for SEA, covering eight languages, 21,640 samples, across three subsets: general, in-the-wild, and content generation. The experimental results from our benchmark demonstrate that even state-of-the-art LLMs and guardrails are challenged by SEA cultural and harm scenarios and underperform when compared to English texts.

<div> Keywords: large language models, incidentalomas, radiology reports, anatomy-aware prompting, lesion detection  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The study evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) against supervised transformer-based baselines for fine-grained, lesion-level detection of incidentalomas that require follow-up in radiology reports. Using a dataset of 400 annotated radiology reports containing 1,623 verified lesion findings, the authors compare three supervised models (BioClinicalModernBERT, ModernBERT, Clinical Longformer) with four generative LLM configurations (Llama 3.1-8B, GPT-4o, GPT-OSS-20b). A novel inference method incorporating lesion-tagged inputs and anatomy-aware prompting is introduced to enhance model reasoning capabilities. Results show that the anatomy-informed GPT-OSS-20b model delivers the best performance, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.79 for incidentaloma-positive detection, outperforming all supervised baselines, whose top macro-F1 was 0.70, and closely matching inter-annotator agreement at 0.76. Incorporating anatomical context significantly improves the performance of GPT-based models (p < 0.05). Additionally, a majority-vote ensemble of the leading models boosts macro-F1 to 0.90. Error analysis indicates that anatomy-aware LLMs excel at contextual understanding, effectively differentiating actionable lesions from benign findings. The study concludes that with structured lesion tagging and anatomical grounding, generative LLMs provide a reliable and interpretable solution for automated incidental finding surveillance in radiology workflows, rivaling human expert accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate large language models (LLMs) against supervised baselines for fine-grained, lesion-level detection of incidentalomas requiring follow-up, addressing the limitations of current document-level classification systems.
  Methods: We utilized a dataset of 400 annotated radiology reports containing 1,623 verified lesion findings. We compared three supervised transformer-based encoders (BioClinicalModernBERT, ModernBERT, Clinical Longformer) against four generative LLM configurations (Llama 3.1-8B, GPT-4o, GPT-OSS-20b). We introduced a novel inference strategy using lesion-tagged inputs and anatomy-aware prompting to ground model reasoning. Performance was evaluated using class-specific F1-scores.
  Results: The anatomy-informed GPT-OSS-20b model achieved the highest performance, yielding an incidentaloma-positive macro-F1 of 0.79. This surpassed all supervised baselines (maximum macro-F1: 0.70) and closely matched the inter-annotator agreement of 0.76. Explicit anatomical grounding yielded statistically significant performance gains across GPT-based models (p < 0.05), while a majority-vote ensemble of the top systems further improved the macro-F1 to 0.90. Error analysis revealed that anatomy-aware LLMs demonstrated superior contextual reasoning in distinguishing actionable findings from benign lesions.
  Conclusion: Generative LLMs, when enhanced with structured lesion tagging and anatomical context, significantly outperform traditional supervised encoders and achieve performance comparable to human experts. This approach offers a reliable, interpretable pathway for automated incidental finding surveillance in radiology workflows.

<div> Mathematical Word Problems, Tree-of-Thought, Chain-of-Thought, Bengali NLP, Large Language Models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper investigates the effectiveness of Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning in solving Mathematical Word Problems (MWPs) for the Bengali language, using the SOMADHAN dataset. MWPs are challenging because they require both deep linguistic comprehension and multi-step numerical reasoning. The authors compare three prompting strategies—standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT)—across multiple large language models (LLMs), including GPT-OSS and LLaMA variants. Due to computational constraints, experiments are conducted on a curated set of 100 representative MWPs. Results show that CoT prompting boosts accuracy from a baseline of 78% under standard prompting to 83% on average. Further, ToT reasoning improves performance by up to 5 percentage points, reaching 88% accuracy with the largest GPT-OSS-120B model. The gains are most prominent in medium to large scale models, with smaller models benefiting less from ToT. The study demonstrates that ToT provides more reliable and globally consistent reasoning paths compared to linear CoT, especially in a low-resource language context like Bengali. Ultimately, the findings establish ToT as a powerful and robust framework for multilingual mathematical reasoning tasks, suggesting broader potential for structured reasoning techniques in natural language processing. <div>

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise, its linear structure often propagates errors, limiting overall effectiveness. To address this limitation, we present the a systematic study of Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning for Bengali MWPs using the SOMADHAN dataset. Owing to computational and token-cost constraints, we evaluate a curated set of 100 representative problems across multiple large language models (LLMs), including GPT-OSS and LLaMA variants, under standard prompting, CoT, and ToT strategies. Our results show that CoT improves baseline accuracy from 78% (standard prompting) to 83% on average, while ToT further increases performance by up to 5 percentage points, achieving 88% accuracy with GPT-OSS-120B. These improvements highlight that ToT is particularly effective in medium-to-large-scale models but may offer less advantage for smaller ones. Overall, our findings establish ToT as a robust framework for solving mathematical problems in low-resource languages such as Bengali. More broadly, this study shows that structured reasoning methods like ToT can provide more reliable and globally consistent outcomes than CoT, paving the way for better reasoning strategies in multilingual NLP.

Abstract: We introduce an open, machine-readable corpus of Greek government decisions sourced from the national transparency platform Diavgeia. The resource comprises 1 million decisions, featuring and high-quality raw text extracted from PDFs. It is released with raw extracted text in Markdown format, alongside a fully reproducible extraction pipeline. Beyond the core dataset, we conduct qualitative analyses to explore boilerplate patterns and design a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) task by formulating a set of representative questions, creating high-quality answers, and evaluating a baseline RAG system on its ability to retrieve and reason over public decisions. This evaluation demonstrates the potential of large-scale public-sector corpora to support advanced information access and transparency through structured retrieval and reasoning over governmental documents, and highlights how such a RAG pipeline could simulate a chat-based assistant capable of interactively answering questions about public decisions. Due to its scale, quality, and domain coverage, the corpus can also serve as high-value pre-training or fine-tuning material for new Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) respectively, including specialized models for legal and governmental domains, and as a foundation for novel approaches in domain adaptation, knowledge-grounded generation, and explainable AI. Finally, we discuss limitations, outline future directions, and make both the data and the code accessible.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, medical QA, multilingual reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, clinical decision-support<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the limitation of existing medical Question Answering (QA) systems which are predominantly English-focused and depend heavily on distillation from general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs), thus raising concerns about the accuracy and reliability of medical knowledge. The authors propose a novel method for generating multilingual reasoning traces rooted in factual medical knowledge, specifically in English, Italian, and Spanish. They create a large dataset containing 500,000 reasoning traces using a retrieval-augmented generation approach leveraging medical information sourced from Wikipedia. This dataset expands medical QA benchmarks MedQA and MedMCQA into Italian and Spanish, facilitating multilingual evaluation. The pipeline is tested both in-domain and out-of-domain across multiple Medical QA benchmarks. Results demonstrate that incorporating these reasoning traces enhances performance through in-context few-shot learning and supervised fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art outcomes among LLMs with 8 billion parameters. The work contributes valuable resources by releasing the reasoning traces, translated QA datasets, a Medical-Wikipedia corpus, and fine-tuned models. Overall, the study promotes the advancement of safer, more interpretable clinical decision-support tools applicable in multilingual healthcare environments. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have recently demonstrated strong potential in medical Question Answering (QA). Existing approaches are largely English-focused and primarily rely on distillation from general-purpose LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of their medical knowledge. In this work, we present a method to generate multilingual reasoning traces grounded in factual medical knowledge. We produce 500k traces in English, Italian, and Spanish, using a retrievalaugmented generation approach over medical information from Wikipedia. The traces are generated to solve medical questions drawn from MedQA and MedMCQA, which we extend to Italian and Spanish. We test our pipeline in both in-domain and outof-domain settings across Medical QA benchmarks, and demonstrate that our reasoning traces improve performance both when utilized via in-context learning (few-shot) and supervised fine-tuning, yielding state-of-the-art results among 8B-parameter LLMs. We believe that these resources can support the development of safer, more transparent clinical decision-support tools in multilingual settings. We release the full suite of resources: reasoning traces, translated QA datasets, Medical-Wikipedia, and fine-tuned models.

<div> Interleaved Reasoning, Latent Visual Representations, Multimodal Large Language Models, Self-supervision, Visual Feedback

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the computational challenges in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that use interleaved reasoning paradigms with visual feedback by proposing a novel framework called Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR). Existing methods that rely on latent visual reasoning face a trade-off between precise perceptual modeling and the ability to handle dynamic problems due to either over-compression of features or non-interleaved static representations. ILVR overcomes this limitation by interleaving textual generation and latent visual representations, which serve as evolving cues to guide subsequent reasoning steps. A key innovation in ILVR is the use of a self-supervision strategy featuring a Momentum Teacher Model, which selectively distills relevant features from helper images to create sparse, adaptive supervision targets. This mechanism enables the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals that enhance reasoning performance. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR significantly outperforms existing techniques by effectively balancing fine-grained perception with sequential multimodal reasoning, making it a promising approach for dynamic visual-language tasks. <div>

Abstract: Interleaved reasoning paradigms enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual feedback but are hindered by the prohibitive computational cost of repeatedly re-encoding pixel-dense images. A promising alternative, latent visual reasoning, circumvents this bottleneck yet currently forces a critical trade-off: methods either sacrifice precise perceptual modeling by over-compressing features or fail to model dynamic problems due to static, non-interleaved structures. We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. To enable this, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a Momentum Teacher Model selectively distills relevant features from helper images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained perception and sequential multimodal reasoning.

Keywords: clinical education, large language models, multi-agent simulation, Socratic teaching, reinforcement learning  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge in medical education stemming from the growing demand for clinical training and the shortage of expert instructors. To bridge this gap, the authors propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized guidance but highlight that previous work predominantly focuses on one-on-one knowledge transfer, neglecting collaborative reasoning, which is critical in clinical teamwork settings like ward rounds. To overcome this limitation, they develop ClinEdu, a multi-agent pedagogical simulator featuring personality-driven patients and diverse student groups, which facilitates controlled testing and scalable data generation for complex teaching processes. Using ClinEdu, the researchers construct ClinTeach, a comprehensive Socratic dialogue dataset capturing the intricacies of group instruction in clinical education. Building on this, they introduce MedTutor-R1, the first multimodal Socratic tutor tailored for one-to-many clinical instruction. MedTutor-R1 undergoes instruction tuning on the ClinTeach dataset and subsequent reinforcement learning optimization guided by a three-axis rubric evaluating structural fidelity, analytical quality, and clinical safety, enhancing its adaptive Socratic teaching strategies. For authentic evaluation, the tutor is tested in-situ by re-integrating it into ClinEdu for simulation-based interactive assessment. Experimental results show MedTutor-R1 improves pedagogical performance by over 20% compared to the base model, matches or exceeds comparable models, and demonstrates strong adaptability in managing varying student numbers, validating the efficacy of ClinEdu as a pedagogical simulation platform. <div>

Abstract: The significant gap between rising demands for clinical training and the scarcity of expert instruction poses a major challenge to medical education. With powerful capabilities in personalized guidance, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to bridge this gap. However, current research focuses mainly on one-on-one knowledge instruction, overlooking collaborative reasoning, a key skill for students developed in teamwork like ward rounds. To this end, we develop ClinEdu, a multi-agent pedagogical simulator with personality-driven patients and diverse student cohorts, enabling controlled testing of complex pedagogical processes and scalable generation of teaching data. Based on ClinEdu, we construct ClinTeach, a large Socratic teaching dialogue dataset that captures the complexities of group instruction. We then train MedTutor-R1, the first multimodal Socratic tutor designed for one-to-many instruction in clinical medical education. MedTutor-R1 is first instruction-tuned on our ClinTeach dataset and then optimized with reinforcement learning, using rewards derived from a three-axis rubric, covering structural fidelity, analytical quality, and clinical safety, to refine its adaptive Socratic strategies. For authentic in-situ assessment, we use simulation-based interactive evaluation that redeploys the tutor back into ClinEdu. Experimental results demonstrate that our MedTutor-R1 outperforms the base model by over 20% in average pedagogical score and is comparable to o3, while also exhibiting high adaptability in handling a varying number of students. This promising performance underscores the effectiveness of our pedagogical simulator, ClinEdu.

<div> Keywords: case law retrieval, OpenAI embeddings, domain-specific BERT, noisy evaluation, Czech Constitutional Court

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of retrieving case law, a task traditionally done via database queries that can be time-consuming. It compares two models for the Czech Constitutional Court decisions: a large general-purpose OpenAI embedder and a domain-specific BERT model trained from scratch on about 30,000 court decisions using sliding windows and attention pooling techniques. The evaluation framework is noise-aware and involves IDF-weighted keyword overlap to measure graded relevance, uses two binarization thresholds (0.20 for balanced, 0.28 for strict), paired bootstrap tests for statistical significance, and an nDCG-based diagnostic analysis coupled with qualitative assessment. Results demonstrate that despite modest absolute nDCG scores—which are expected due to noisy labels—the general OpenAI embedder consistently and significantly outperforms the domain-specific BERT at ranking cutoffs @10, @20, and @100 under both thresholds. Diagnostic insights attribute the relatively low absolute performance mainly to label drift and idealistic targets rather than the models’ lack of capability or utility. Finally, the authors highlight that their evaluation framework is sufficiently robust to handle noisy gold datasets, a common issue when working with heterogeneous legacy judicial data labels, making it useful for future legal document retrieval benchmarking. <div>

Abstract: Retrieving case law is a time-consuming task predominantly carried out by querying databases. We provide a comparison of two models in three different settings for Czech Constitutional Court decisions: (i) a large general-purpose embedder (OpenAI), (ii) a domain-specific BERT-trained from scratch on ~30,000 decisions using sliding windows and attention pooling. We propose a noise-aware evaluation including IDF-weighted keyword overlap as graded relevance, binarization via two thresholds (0.20 balanced, 0.28 strict), significance via paired bootstrap, and an nDCG diagnosis supported with qualitative analysis. Despite modest absolute nDCG (expected under noisy labels), the general OpenAI embedder decisively outperforms the domain pre-trained BERT in both settings at @10/@20/@100 across both thresholds; differences are statistically significant. Diagnostics attribute low absolutes to label drift and strong ideals rather than lack of utility. Additionally, our framework is robust enough to be used for evaluation under a noisy gold dataset, which is typical when handling data with heterogeneous labels stemming from legacy judicial databases.

The paper introduces a new methodology to enhance the accuracy of faithfulness evaluation in Large Language Models (LLMs).<br />2. The approach improves faithfulness assessment by combining several elementary faithfulness metrics into a single fused metric.<br />3.

Abstract: We present a methodology for improving the accuracy of faithfulness evaluation in Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed methodology is based on the combination of elementary faithfulness metrics into a combined (fused) metric, for the purpose of improving the faithfulness of LLM outputs. The proposed strategy for metric fusion deploys a tree-based model to identify the importance of each metric, which is driven by the integration of human judgements evaluating the faithfulness of LLM responses. This fused metric is demonstrated to correlate more strongly with human judgements across all tested domains for faithfulness. Improving the ability to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs, allows for greater confidence to be placed within models, allowing for their implementation in a greater diversity of scenarios. Additionally, we homogenise a collection of datasets across question answering and dialogue-based domains and implement human judgements and LLM responses within this dataset, allowing for the reproduction and trialling of faithfulness evaluation across domains.

Keywords: Large Language Models, Conformal In-Context Learning, text classification, efficiency, class imbalance  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper evaluates Conformal In-Context Learning (CICLe), a framework that combines lightweight base classifiers with Conformal Prediction to optimize the prompting of Large Language Models (LLMs) for text classification. CICLe adaptively reduces the candidate class set, thereby improving classification efficiency. The study systematically tests CICLe across multiple NLP classification benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvement over base classifiers and outperforming few-shot prompting baselines given sufficient training data. In scenarios with limited data, CICLe performs comparably with existing methods. Efficiency gains are notable, with reductions in the number of shots by up to 34.45% and prompt length by up to 25.16%, allowing the use of smaller LLMs without a loss in performance. The framework is especially effective on classification tasks exhibiting high class imbalance, where it maintains robust results. Overall, CICLe integrates the stability of traditional classifiers with the flexibility of LLMs, presenting a scalable and practical approach that improves both data and computational efficiency in text classification tasks. <div>
arXiv:2512.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong in-context learning abilities, yet their effectiveness in text classification depends heavily on prompt design and incurs substantial computational cost. Conformal In-Context Learning (CICLe) has been proposed as a resource-efficient framework that integrates a lightweight base classifier with Conformal Prediction to guide LLM prompting by adaptively reducing the set of candidate classes. However, its broader applicability and efficiency benefits beyond a single domain have not yet been systematically explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of CICLe across diverse NLP classification benchmarks. The results show that CICLe consistently improves over its base classifier and outperforms few-shot prompting baselines when the sample size is sufficient for training the base classifier, and performs comparably in low-data regimes. In terms of efficiency, CICLe reduces the number of shots and prompt length by up to 34.45% and 25.16%, respectively, and enables the use of smaller models with competitive performance. CICLe is furthermore particularly advantageous for text classification tasks with high class imbalance. These findings highlight CICLe as a practical and scalable approach for efficient text classification, combining the robustness of traditional classifiers with the adaptability of LLMs, and achieving substantial gains in data and computational efficiency.

<title>Capturing Classic Authorial Style in Long-Form Story Generation with GRPO Fine-Tuning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: large language models, style-conditioned story generation, authorship verification, Group Relative Policy Optimization, narrative coherence<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of fine-grained stylistic control in open-ended story generation by introducing a novel training framework called Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior approaches that rely on superficial cues to mimic authorial style, this work leverages a style reward derived from a fine-tuned sentence transformer using authorship verification signals. To ensure balanced story quality, the system also incorporates content and completeness rewards, stabilizing the generation of long-form narratives. The methodology is evaluated on fiction by Mark Twain, specifically using The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as the style reference. Experiments with an 8-billion parameter model demonstrate that it surpasses larger baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4 in style alignment metrics, achieving a style score of 0.628 while maintaining competitive content quality. Despite the success in stylistic imitation, the study acknowledges ongoing challenges related to narrative completeness and global coherence, suggesting further research is needed to improve overall story resolution and cohesion. The results indicate that moderate-sized, task-specific models can effectively perform agentic stylistic story generation, paving the way for more nuanced and controlled creative AI writing. <div>
arXiv:2512.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) show impressive performance in open-ended story generation, but fine-grained stylistic control remains limited. Existing methods often rely on shallow cues (e.g., names or topics) to simulate authorial style, without robust evaluation. In this work, we present a training framework for style-conditioned story generation using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a custom multi-reward setup. The style reward is derived from a fine-tuned sentence transformer using authorship verification (AV) signals, combined with content and completeness scores to stabilize long-form narrative generation. We conduct experiments using fiction by Mark Twain, a prominent 19th-century American author, with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn serving as the reference style exemplar. Our 8B model outperforms larger baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4 in AV-style metrics, achieving a style score of 0.628 and competitive content quality. Results demonstrate the feasibility of agentic stylistic generation with moderate model size and task-specific training. While the output is clearly style-aligned, narrative completeness remains a challenge, indicating future work is needed to better model global coherence and story resolution.

<div> Keywords: interruptions, Supreme Court, gender dynamics, semantic analysis, sentiment analysis  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study investigates the impact of interruptions during U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments on both the semantic content and emotional tone of advocates' speech, with a particular emphasis on gendered communication dynamics. Using the ConvoKit Supreme Court Corpus covering data from 2010 to 2019, the authors analyze 12,663 speech segments from interactions between advocates and justices. The research assesses whether interruptions lead to changes in the meaning of the advocates' arguments and if interruptions directed at female advocates carry distinct emotional qualities. Semantic shifts caused by interruptions are measured using GloVe-based sentence embeddings, which quantify the similarity between speech before and after interruptions. Sentiment is evaluated using lexicon-based sentiment analysis to detect positive or negative emotional valence. Findings reveal that despite interruptions, semantic similarity remains high, indicating that the core argumentative content is mostly preserved. However, interruptions targeted at female advocates consistently exhibit significantly higher levels of negative sentiment compared to those directed at male advocates. The results contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of how gender intersects with communication power dynamics in elite judicial settings and highlight the utility of computational linguistics methods for exploring issues of power, discourse, and equity in legal proceedings. <div>

Abstract: This study examines how interruptions during U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments shape both the semantic content and emotional tone of advocates' speech, with a focus on gendered dynamics in judicial discourse. Using the ConvoKit Supreme Court Corpus (2010-2019), we analyze 12,663 speech chunks from advocate-justice interactions to assess whether interruptions alter the meaning of an advocate's argument and whether interruptions toward female advocates exhibit more negative emotional valence. Semantic shifts are quantified using GloVe-based sentence embeddings, while sentiment is measured through lexicon-based analysis. We find that semantic similarity between pre- and post-interruption speech remains consistently high, suggesting that interruptions do not substantially alter argumentative content. However, interruptions directed at female advocates contain significantly higher levels of negative sentiment. These results deepen empirical understanding of gendered communication in elite institutional settings and demonstrate the value of computational linguistic methods for studying power, discourse, and equity in judicial proceedings.

<div> Personas, AI models, performance, multiple-choice, expert prompts<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study examines whether assigning personas to AI models improves their performance on challenging multiple-choice questions from graduate-level science, engineering, and law exams. Three approaches were tested: in-domain expert personas (e.g., telling the model it is a physics expert when answering physics questions), off-domain expert personas (assigning an expert persona unrelated to the domain of the question), and low-knowledge personas (such as layperson, young child, or toddler). The results show that in-domain expert personas generally had no significant impact on accuracy across six different models, except for a slight improvement seen in the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. Off-domain expert personas sometimes led to marginal differences or even degraded performance. Low-knowledge personas consistently harmed model accuracy. Overall, persona prompts did not improve answer accuracy compared to a baseline without personas. While personas may influence aspects like output tone or style, this investigation found no consistent factual accuracy benefit from adopting persona prompts when answering difficult multiple-choice questions in specialized domains. <div>
arXiv:2512.05858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the fourth in a series of short reports that help business, education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with AI through rigorous testing. Here, we ask whether assigning personas to models improves performance on difficult objective multiple-choice questions. We study both domain-specific expert personas and low-knowledge personas, evaluating six models on GPQA Diamond (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024), graduate-level questions spanning science, engineering, and law.
  We tested three approaches:
  -In-Domain Experts: Assigning the model an expert persona ("you are a physics expert") matched to the problem type (physics problems) had no significant impact on performance (with the exception of the Gemini 2.0 Flash model).
  -Off-Domain Experts (Domain-Mismatched): Assigning the model an expert persona ("you are a physics expert") not matched to the problem type (law problems) resulted in marginal differences.
  -Low-Knowledge Personas: We assigned the model negative capability personas (layperson, young child, toddler), which were generally harmful to benchmark accuracy.
  Across both benchmarks, persona prompts generally did not improve accuracy relative to a no-persona baseline. Expert personas showed no consistent benefit across models, with few exceptions. Domain-mismatched expert personas sometimes degraded performance. Low-knowledge personas often reduced accuracy. These results are about the accuracy of answers only; personas may serve other purposes (such as altering the tone of outputs), beyond improving factual performance.

<div> Medical QA, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Large Language Models, LoRA fine-tuning, Biomedical accuracy  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of applying large language models (LLMs) to medical question-answering (QA) tasks, focusing on improving factual accuracy and minimizing hallucinations. The authors propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that integrates domain-specific medical literature retrieval with open-source LLMs—specifically LLaMA 2 and Falcon. They employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune these models efficiently for the medical domain, enhancing their specialization without heavy resource costs. By grounding answers in retrieved medical references, the system reduces unsupported content by approximately 60%, substantially improving the reliability of the outputs. The approach was evaluated on benchmark datasets PubMedQA and MedMCQA, demonstrating measurable accuracy improvements: for example, a fine-tuned LLaMA 2 model achieved 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA compared to a 55.4% zero-shot baseline. Additionally, the system maintains transparency by providing source citations for its answers, supporting trust and verification in clinical contexts. The methodology and system design are detailed, highlighting the practical potential of retrieval-augmented, fine-tuned open-source LLMs for biomedical QA and clinical informatics applications. This study underscores the value of combining retrieval with LLMs to meet the stringent factual demands of medical question-answering. <div>

Abstract: Medical question-answering (QA) systems can benefit from advances in large language models (LLMs), but directly applying LLMs to the clinical domain poses challenges such as maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding hallucinations. In this paper, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based medical QA system that combines domain-specific knowledge retrieval with open-source LLMs to answer medical questions. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art open LLMs (LLaMA~2 and Falcon) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient domain specialization. The system retrieves relevant medical literature to ground the LLM's answers, thereby improving factual correctness and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the approach on benchmark datasets (PubMedQA and MedMCQA) and show that retrieval augmentation yields measurable improvements in answer accuracy compared to using LLMs alone. Our fine-tuned LLaMA~2 model achieves 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA, substantially improving over the 55.4% zero-shot baseline, while maintaining transparency by providing source references. We also detail the system design and fine-tuning methodology, demonstrating that grounding answers in retrieved evidence reduces unsupported content by approximately 60%. These results highlight the potential of RAG-augmented open-source LLMs for reliable biomedical QA, pointing toward practical clinical informatics applications.

1. The paper addresses limitations of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, which mainly stem from reliance on static training data.  
2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is proposed as a solution to provide access to real-time, culturally rich, and multilingual information, enhancing VQA capabilities.  
3. The authors introduce M4-RAG, a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 80,000 culturally diverse image-question pairs spanning 42 languages and 56 regional dialects and registers, designed to evaluate retrieval-augmented VQA systems.  
4. A controlled retrieval environment is constructed containing millions of curated multilingual documents relevant to the query domains, balancing realism in retrieval with reproducibility in experiments.  
5. Experimental results demonstrate that while RAG improves performance for smaller VLMs, it does not scale well to larger models and can even degrade their accuracy, highlighting an important mismatch between increasing model size and the current retrieval mechanisms.  
6. M4-RAG sets a foundation for developing next-generation RAG systems capable of reasoning effectively across multiple languages, modalities, and cultural contexts, pushing forward the field of multilingual multimodal VQA research. <div>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance in visual question answering (VQA), yet they remain constrained by static training data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this limitation by enabling access to up-to-date, culturally grounded, and multilingual information; however, multilingual multimodal RAG remains largely underexplored. We introduce M4-RAG, a massive-scale benchmark covering 42 languages and 56 regional dialects and registers, comprising over 80,000 culturally diverse image-question pairs for evaluating retrieval-augmented VQA across languages and modalities. To balance realism with reproducibility, we build a controlled retrieval environment containing millions of carefully curated multilingual documents relevant to the query domains, approximating real-world retrieval conditions while ensuring consistent experimentation. Our systematic evaluation reveals that although RAG consistently benefits smaller VLMs, it fails to scale to larger models and often even degrades their performance, exposing a critical mismatch between model size and current retrieval effectiveness. M4-RAG provides a foundation for advancing next-generation RAG systems capable of reasoning seamlessly across languages, modalities, and cultural contexts.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, providing user queries with visually enhanced responses can considerably benefit understanding and memory, underscoring the great value of interleaved image-text generation. Despite recent progress, like the visual autoregressive model that unifies text and image processing in a single transformer architecture, generating high-quality interleaved content remains challenging. Moreover, evaluations of these interleaved sequences largely remain underexplored, with existing benchmarks often limited by unimodal metrics that inadequately assess the intricacies of combined image-text outputs. To address these issues, we present RAG-IGBench, a thorough benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the task of Interleaved Generation based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG-IG) in open-domain question answering. RAG-IG integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with retrieval mechanisms, enabling the models to access external image-text information for generating coherent multimodal content. Distinct from previous datasets, RAG-IGBench draws on the latest publicly available content from social platforms and introduces innovative evaluation metrics that measure the quality of text and images, as well as their consistency. Through extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs (both open-source and proprietary) on RAG-IGBench, we provide an in-depth analysis examining the capabilities and limitations of these models. Additionally, we validate our evaluation metrics by demonstrating their high correlation with human assessments. Models fine-tuned on RAG-IGBench's training set exhibit improved performance across multiple benchmarks, confirming both the quality and practical utility of our dataset. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/RAG-IGBench.

<div> Keywords: video dubbing, speech naturalness, audio-visual synchronization, cross-lingual speech synthesis, SyncVoice<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Video dubbing involves generating high-quality speech that is closely aligned in time with the visual content. Existing approaches face challenges in maintaining natural speech quality and precise synchronization between audio and visual streams while being typically restricted to monolingual contexts. The paper introduces SyncVoice, a novel framework for video dubbing that leverages vision-augmented techniques built on a pretrained text-to-speech (TTS) model. By fine-tuning this TTS model using audio-visual data, SyncVoice achieves strong synchronization between speech and visuals, significantly improving audiovisual consistency. A key innovation is the Dual Speaker Encoder, designed to reduce inter-language interference in cross-lingual speech synthesis, enabling more effective dubbing across different languages. The framework is also explored within video translation scenarios, demonstrating its practical applicability beyond monolingual settings. Experimental evaluation shows that SyncVoice produces speech with high fidelity and superior synchronization performance compared to existing methods. Overall, SyncVoice addresses critical limitations in current video dubbing methods by enhancing speech naturalness, audio-visual alignment, and cross-lingual synthesis capabilities, highlighting its potential for advancing video dubbing technology. <div>

Abstract: Video dubbing aims to generate high-fidelity speech that is precisely temporally aligned with the visual content. Existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech naturalness and audio-visual synchronization, and are limited to monolingual settings. To address these challenges, we propose SyncVoice, a vision-augmented video dubbing framework built upon a pretrained text-to-speech (TTS) model. By fine-tuning the TTS model on audio-visual data, we achieve strong audiovisual consistency. We propose a Dual Speaker Encoder to effectively mitigate inter-language interference in cross-lingual speech synthesis and explore the application of video dubbing in video translation scenarios. Experimental results show that SyncVoice achieves high-fidelity speech generation with strong synchronization performance, demonstrating its potential in video dubbing tasks.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Faithfulness Evaluation, Kullback-Leibler Divergence, Semantic Faithfulness, Entropy Production<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating faithfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing specific tasks, proposing new unsupervised metrics rooted in information theory and thermodynamics.<br />2. The authors conceptualize an LLM as a bipartite information engine where internal hidden layers function analogously to a Maxwell demon, regulating the transformation of context (C) into an answer (A) guided by a prompt (Q).<br />3. They represent Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over common topics, and model the topic transformations from context to prompt and answer as transition matrices Q and A, respectively.<br />4. The Semantic Faithfulness (SF) metric is introduced, measuring faithfulness via the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the inferred transition matrices, optimized through convex optimization and normalized to a [0,1] scale, where higher values indicate greater faithfulness.<br />5. Additionally, a thermodynamics-based Semantic Entropy Production (SEP) metric is proposed, linking lower entropy production to higher faithfulness, with both SF and SEP metrics applicable independently or jointly for faithfully evaluating LLM outputs and controlling hallucinations.<br />6. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through experiments on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings, highlighting its practical utility. <div>

Abstract: Evaluating faithfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to a given task is a complex challenge. We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings.

<div> Keywords: Artificial General Intelligence, creativity, algorithmic limits, functional capabilities, computation theory  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper addresses the question of how close humanity is to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (A.G.I.), defined as the ability of a model to be creative and innovate in a field, unlocking new functional capabilities.  
2. It adopts an existing definition of A.G.I. emphasizing creativity and innovation, reflecting the views of leading A.I. developers.  
3. The authors formally prove that no algorithm can produce new functional capabilities that were not inherent in the original algorithm, establishing a fundamental upper bound on machine computation.  
4. Consequently, the paper argues that true creativity or innovation, in the sense of generating genuinely new capabilities, is impossible for any algorithm or A.I. model. However, A.I. can recombine or permute existing capabilities effectively.  
5. The work concludes by discussing the broader implications for the future of A.I., suggesting inherent limits to machine creativity, and raises questions about the nature and origins of human intelligence, which seemingly transcends these algorithmic constraints. <div>

Abstract: In recent years we observed rapid and significant advancements in artificial intelligence (A.I.). So much so that many wonder how close humanity is to developing an A.I. model that can achieve human level of intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence.

<div> Keywords: Information Retrieval, Large Language Models, Text Summarization, Relevance Judgments, Evaluation Stability  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper examines the impact of text summarization on the reliability of Large Language Model (LLM)-based relevance judgments within Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation. First, it recognizes that traditional relevance judgments by human annotators are costly and that LLMs offer promising automated assessment capabilities. Second, it challenges the conventional approach where LLM assessors evaluate full document content directly, proposing the exploration of using LLM-generated summaries of varying lengths instead. Third, through experiments on multiple TREC datasets with state-of-the-art LLMs, the study compares the agreement between summary-based and full-document judgments against human labels. Fourth, it assesses how these different judgment sources affect IR system evaluation outcomes, particularly examining retrieval effectiveness and ranking stability. Finally, findings indicate that summary-based judgments maintain comparable ranking stability to full-document judgments but introduce systematic shifts in label distributions and biases that depend on the model and dataset used. The paper concludes that while summarization offers a practical means for more efficient large-scale IR evaluation, it also presents methodological considerations essential for the reliability of automatic relevance assessments. <div>

Abstract: Relevance judgments are central to the evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems, but obtaining them from human annotators is costly and time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as automated assessors, showing promising alignment with human annotations. Most prior studies have treated documents as fixed units, feeding their full content directly to LLM assessors. We investigate how text summarization affects the reliability of LLM-based judgments and their downstream impact on IR evaluation. Using state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple TREC collections, we compare judgments made from full documents with those based on LLM-generated summaries of different lengths. We examine their agreement with human labels, their effect on retrieval effectiveness evaluation, and their influence on IR systems' ranking stability. Our findings show that summary-based judgments achieve comparable stability in systems' ranking to full-document judgments, while introducing systematic shifts in label distributions and biases that vary by model and dataset. These results highlight summarization as both an opportunity for more efficient large-scale IR evaluation and a methodological choice with important implications for the reliability of automatic judgments.

<div> Keywords: causal inference, text data, positivity assumption, token selection, Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR)  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses challenges in using high-dimensional text data for causal inference, specifically in adjusting for confounding factors in treatment effect estimation. The authors identify that the positivity assumption—which requires sufficient overlap in treatment assignments across confounder values—is often violated due to the large and redundant textual feature spaces, resulting in extreme propensity scores and unstable estimates. To overcome this, they propose Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a novel framework that selects a sparse and necessary subset of tokens. CATR employs a residual-independence diagnostic to ensure that the selected tokens preserve essential confounding information needed for unbiased causal effect estimation. By filtering out irrelevant textual data and retaining key signals, CATR effectively mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. The framework is empirically validated through experiments on synthetic datasets and a real-world medical dataset from the MIMIC-III database. Results show that CATR produces more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates compared to existing baseline methods, demonstrating its practical value in leveraging text data for robust causal inference. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled the increasing use of text data in causal inference, particularly for adjusting confounding factors in treatment effect estimation. Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines.

<title>Entropy Ratio Clipping as a Soft Global Constraint for Stable Reinforcement Learning</title>

<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05591</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Entropy Ratio, Policy Stability, PPO-Clip, Large Language Models<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses instability issues in large language model post-training that uses off-policy reinforcement learning. The core challenge lies in distribution shifts causing policies to deviate beyond a trust region, leading to unstable gradients and policy entropy fluctuations. Although PPO-Clip helps by clipping importance weights, it fails to account for global distributional shifts of actions, especially those un-sampled. To overcome this, the authors propose using the entropy ratio between current and previous policies as a global metric to measure changes in policy exploration across updates. Building on this, they introduce Entropy Ratio Clipping (ERC), a mechanism that applies bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. ERC stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level, complementing PPO-Clip’s local importance clipping by controlling shifts in probabilities of all actions. The ERC method is integrated into two reinforcement learning algorithms, DAPO and GPPO. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating ERC consistently improves training stability and overall performance. This work contributes a novel global constraint mechanism that enhances reinforcement learning alignment and capability in training large language models. <div>

Abstract: Large language model post-training relies on reinforcement learning to improve model capability and alignment quality. However, the off-policy training paradigm introduces distribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond the trust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations in policy entropy and unstable gradients. Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions. We integrate ERC into both DAPO and GPPO reinforcement learning algorithms. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that ERC consistently improves performance.

<div> Ontology Learning, Large Language Models, Ontology Axiom Benchmark, Axiom Identification, Prompting Strategies  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of automating ontology axiom identification, a crucial task in ontology learning that defines logical relations between classes and properties. The authors introduce OntoAxiom, a benchmark comprising nine medium-sized ontologies with 17,118 triples and 2,771 axioms focused on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. The study evaluates twelve large language models (LLMs) under three shot settings using two prompting strategies: a Direct approach querying all axioms simultaneously and an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach querying one axiom per prompt. Results indicate the AbA prompting outperforms the Direct approach in terms of F1 scores. Performance varies depending on the type of axiom and the domain; for instance, the FOAF ontology subclass axiom scored 0.642, whereas the music ontology scored 0.218. Larger LLMs generally yield better results but smaller models may still be practical in resource-limited scenarios. Despite no fully automated axiom identification solution due to moderate performance, LLMs serve as valuable tools to suggest candidate axioms, supporting ontology engineers in the development and refinement of ontologies. <div>

Abstract: Ontologies are an important tool for structuring domain knowledge, but their development is a complex task that requires significant modelling and domain expertise. Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies.

<div> Keywords: industry funding, AI research, citation impact, citation preference ratio, research insularity  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study investigates the role of industry funding in AI research over the period 1998-2022, analyzing nearly 50,000 papers and millions of citations from top AI conferences such as ICLR, CVPR, AAAI, and ACL. First, it quantifies the growth of industry-funded papers, showing an increase from under 2% before 2015 to over 11% by 2020. Second, it highlights the superior citation impact of industry-funded research, where between 2018 and 2022, 12% of such papers reached high citation levels (h5-index) compared to just 4% for non-industry-funded and 2% for non-funded papers. Third, the paper introduces the Citation Preference Ratio (CPR), revealing that top AI conferences favor citing industry-funded research over non-funded work. Fourth, it uncovers a growing insularity in industry-funded research, as these papers preferentially cite other industry-funded studies and reference fewer non-funded works. Finally, the study finds that industry-funded research tends to cite more recent publications, reflecting a preference for the latest developments. Overall, the findings show a marked shift towards increased industry presence and influence in AI research, with implications for the dynamics of knowledge production and dissemination in the field. <div>

Abstract: Over the past four decades, artificial intelligence (AI) research has flourished at the nexus of academia and industry. However, Big Tech companies have increasingly acquired the edge in computational resources, big data, and talent. So far, it has been largely unclear how many papers the industry funds, how their citation impact compares to non-funded papers, and what drives industry interest. This study fills that gap by quantifying the number of industry-funded papers at 10 top AI conferences (e.g., ICLR, CVPR, AAAI, ACL) and their citation influence. We analyze about 49.8K papers, about 1.8M citations from AI papers to other papers, and about 2.3M citations from other papers to AI papers from 1998-2022 in Scopus. Through seven research questions, we examine the volume and evolution of industry funding in AI research, the citation impact of funded papers, the diversity and temporal range of their citations, and the subfields in which industry predominantly acts. Our findings reveal that industry presence has grown markedly since 2015, from less than 2 percent to more than 11 percent in 2020. Between 2018 and 2022, 12 percent of industry-funded papers achieved high citation rates as measured by the h5-index, compared to 4 percent of non-industry-funded papers and 2 percent of non-funded papers. Top AI conferences engage more with industry-funded research than non-funded research, as measured by our newly proposed metric, the Citation Preference Ratio (CPR). We show that industry-funded research is increasingly insular, citing predominantly other industry-funded papers while referencing fewer non-funded papers. These findings reveal new trends in AI research funding, including a shift towards more industry-funded papers and their growing citation impact, greater insularity of industry-funded work than non-funded work, and a preference of industry-funded research to cite recent work.

<div> Long video understanding, Active perception, Video reasoning, MLLM agents, Evidence-seeking  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. Long video understanding (LVU) is difficult due to sparse, temporally dispersed relevant cues hidden within hours of mostly redundant and irrelevant video content.  
2. Current LVU frameworks depend on query-agnostic captioners which waste computational resources on irrelevant content and lose fine-grained temporal and spatial details.  
3. Inspired by active perception theory, the authors propose that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe in the video and continuously assess if the gathered evidence suffices to answer the query.  
4. The paper presents Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework treating the video as an interactive environment, acquiring compact, query-relevant evidence directly from pixels.  
5. AVP operates via an iterative plan-observe-reflect process using multimodal large language models (MLLM) agents: a planner suggests targeted interactions, an observer extracts time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates whether the collected evidence answers the query or if further observation is needed.  
6. Experiments across five LVU benchmarks show AVP achieves the highest performance, improving average accuracy by 5.7% over the best previous agentic method while requiring only 18.4% of the inference time and 12.4% of the input tokens. <div>

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) is challenging because answering real-world queries often depends on sparse, temporally dispersed cues buried in hours of mostly redundant and irrelevant content. While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.

<title>Vague Knowledge: Information without Transitivity and Partitions</title>

<div> Keywords: vague knowledge, non-transitive indistinguishability, economic models, natural language communication, qualitative reasoning  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper challenges traditional economic models of information that assume knowledge is transitive and forms partitions over states.  
2. It introduces the concept of vague knowledge, characterized by non-transitive indistinguishability across different states, meaning some states cannot be neatly separated or ordered by knowledge.  
3. Despite vague knowledge failing to create a clear partition of the state space, it remains informative by differentiating some states from others.  
4. The study demonstrates that vague knowledge can only be accurately conveyed through vague communication methods, which inherently feature blurred or fuzzy boundaries.  
5. These theoretical insights provide foundational explanations for why natural language—often imprecise and qualitative—is prevalent in real-world human communication and reasoning, reflecting the inherent vagueness of knowledge itself. <div>

Abstract: I relax the standard assumptions of transitivity and partition structure in economic models of information to formalize vague knowledge: non-transitive indistinguishability over states. I show that vague knowledge, while failing to partition the state space, remains informative by distinguishing some states from others. Moreover, it can only be faithfully expressed through vague communication with blurred boundaries. My results provide microfoundations for the prevalence of natural language communication and qualitative reasoning in the real world, where knowledge is often vague.

<title>Natural Language Summarization Enables Multi-Repository Bug Localization by LLMs in Microservice Architectures</title>

<div> Bug localization, multi-repository, microservice architectures, natural language reasoning, hierarchical summaries<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of bug localization in multi-repository microservice architectures, which is complicated by the semantic gap between natural language bug reports and source code, as well as limitations in large language model (LLM) context sizes and the need to identify the correct repository initially. <br /><br />2. The authors propose reframing bug localization as a natural language reasoning task by converting codebases into hierarchical natural language (NL) summaries at multiple levels: file, directory, and repository. This allows the process to be conducted as NL-to-NL search rather than cross-modal retrieval from language to code. <br /><br />3. The method involves a two-phase search: first, routing the bug report to the most relevant repositories, then performing a detailed top-down localization within those repositories to identify specific files likely responsible for the bug. <br /><br />4. Evaluation is conducted on DNext, a large industrial system comprising 46 repositories with 1.1 million lines of code. The approach achieves strong performance metrics—Pass@10 of 0.82 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.50—significantly outperforming retrieval-based baselines and agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems such as GitHub Copilot and Cursor. <br /><br />5. This work highlights the advantage of engineered NL representations over raw source code for scalable bug localization, providing an interpretable multi-level search path from repository down to file. This interpretability is critical to fostering trust and transparency in enterprise AI tools. <div>

Abstract: Bug localization in multi-repository microservice architectures is challenging due to the semantic gap between natural language bug reports and code, LLM context limitations, and the need to first identify the correct repository. We propose reframing this as a natural language reasoning task by transforming codebases into hierarchical NL summaries and performing NL-to-NL search instead of cross-modal retrieval. Our approach builds context-aware summaries at file, directory, and repository levels, then uses a two-phase search: first routing bug reports to relevant repositories, then performing top-down localization within those repositories. Evaluated on DNext, an industrial system with 46 repositories and 1.1M lines of code, our method achieves Pass@10 of 0.82 and MRR of 0.50, significantly outperforming retrieval baselines and agentic RAG systems like GitHub Copilot and Cursor. This work demonstrates that engineered natural language representations can be more effective than raw source code for scalable bug localization, providing an interpretable repository -> directory -> file search path, which is vital for building trust in enterprise AI tools by providing essential transparency.

<div> Keywords: AI papers, mistakes, GPT-5, peer review, reproducibility<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The study investigates the frequency of objective mistakes in published AI research papers, focusing on verifiable errors such as incorrect formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables, deliberately excluding subjective aspects like novelty or writing quality.<br />2. Researchers developed a Paper Correctness Checker, leveraging GPT-5, to systematically identify mistakes in papers from top AI conferences and journals.<br />3. Results show a rising trend in mistakes per paper over recent years, with examples including an increase from 3.8 errors in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (a 55.3% increase), as well as increases in ICLR and TMLR conferences.<br />4. Human experts validated 316 flagged errors, confirming 263 as actual mistakes, yielding an 83.2% precision rate for the AI Checker.<br />5. While most detected errors are minor, correcting them would improve clarity and reproducibility, with some mistakes potentially affecting results interpretation.<br />6. Importantly, the AI Checker can propose accurate corrections for 75.8% of the identified mistakes.<br />7. The study demonstrates the growing utility of advanced large language models in enhancing research quality by detecting and fixing objective errors in published scientific literature. <div>
arXiv:2512.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How many mistakes do published AI papers contain? Peer-reviewed publications form the foundation upon which new research and knowledge are built. Errors that persist in the literature can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion in follow-up studies and complicating reproducibility. The accelerating pace of research and the increasing demands on the peer-review system make such mistakes harder to detect and avoid. To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results. Moreover, we show that the AI Checker can propose correct fixes for 75.8% of the identified mistakes. Overall, this study highlights the potential of frontier LLMs to detect and correct objective mistakes in published papers, helping to establish a firmer foundation of knowledge.

<div> Keywords: GUI grounding, zoom prior, training-free method, UI-Venus-72B, GUIZoom-Bench<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of GUI grounding, which is essential for building graphical user interface agents capable of understanding and interacting with interface elements. Current methods depend heavily on large-scale bounding box annotations but struggle with issues like cross-platform generalization, complex layout analysis, and fine-grained element localization. The authors propose leveraging zoom as a strong and underexplored prior to improve GUI grounding. They introduce ZoomClick, a training-free method that utilizes four key properties of zoom—pre-zoom, depth, shrink size, and minimal crop size—to enable dynamic spatial focusing and adaptive context switching without requiring additional training. Experimental results indicate that ZoomClick substantially enhances the performance of both general vision-language models and specialized GUI grounding models, achieving state-of-the-art results, such as a 73.1% success rate on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by the UI-Venus-72B model. Additionally, the paper presents a new benchmark called GUIZoom-Bench designed to evaluate model adaptability to zoom operations. This benchmark aims to stimulate future research focused on improving zoom techniques for enhanced training and test-time scaling in GUI grounding tasks. <div>

Abstract: Grounding is a fundamental capability for building graphical user interface (GUI) agents. Although existing approaches rely on large-scale bounding box supervision, they still face various challenges, such as cross-platform generalization, complex layout analysis, and fine-grained element localization. In this paper, we investigate zoom as a strong yet underexplored prior for GUI grounding, and propose a training-free method, ZoomClick. By characterizing four key properties of zoom (i.e., pre-zoom, depth, shrink size, minimal crop size), we unlock its full capabilities for dynamic spatial focusing and adaptive context switching. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of both general vision-language and specialized GUI grounding models, achieving state-of-the-art results on several mainstream benchmarks; for example, UI-Venus-72B attains a 73.1% success rate on ScreenSpot-Pro. Furthermore, we present GUIZoom-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating model adaptability to zoom, aiming to inspire future research on improving zoom for further training and test-time scaling in GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures are gaining significant attention for their ability to ground language generation in reliable knowledge sources. Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance. This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation. They also demonstrate the potential of entity-aware RAG systems in educational environments, fostering adaptive and reliable AI-based tutoring tools.

The authors propose a prompt-based learning paradigm that reduces the reliance on large datasets by using prompted training paired with answer mapping techniques. This allows small language models to achieve competitive intent recognition performance with minimal training data. To further improve results, the study integrates active sampling and ensemble learning strategies within the prompted training pipeline. Additionally, preliminary zero-shot experiments reveal that small language models, when equipped with carefully designed and detailed prompts, can follow instructions effectively even without additional training. These findings demonstrate the potential for more data-efficient semantic modeling of customer-agent conversations. The approach paves the way for advancements in AI-driven customer service by enabling intent recognition tasks using limited data and leveraging small-scale models, making the technology more accessible and practical in real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: Recognizing customer intent accurately with language models based on customer-agent conversational data is essential in today's digital customer service marketplace, but it is often hindered by the lack of sufficient labeled data. In this paper, we introduce the prompt-based learning paradigm that significantly reduces the dependency on extensive datasets. Utilizing prompted training combined with answer mapping techniques, this approach allows small language models to achieve competitive intent recognition performance with only a minimal amount of training data. Furthermore, We enhance the performance by integrating active sampling and ensemble learning strategies in the prompted training pipeline. Additionally, preliminary tests in a zero-shot setting demonstrate that, with well-crafted and detailed prompts, small language models show considerable instruction-following potential even without any further training. These results highlight the viability of semantic modeling of conversational data in a more data-efficient manner with minimal data use, paving the way for advancements in AI-driven customer service.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, token compression, Vision Centric Token Compression, Probability-Informed Visual Enhancement, in-context learning benchmarks<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) with expanding context windows reaching hundreds of thousands of tokens, and model sizes growing from billions to trillions of parameters, which leads to soaring compute and memory demands.<br /><br />2. To mitigate these costs, the authors propose Vision Centric Token Compression (Vist), a novel slow-fast compression framework inspired by human reading patterns. The fast path converts distant tokens into images, allowing a frozen, lightweight vision encoder to efficiently skim low-salience context, while the slow path processes the proximal token window in detail within the LLM for nuanced reasoning.<br /><br />3. The framework incorporates a Probability-Informed Visual Enhancement (PVE) training objective that masks high-frequency tokens, guiding the Resampler to concentrate on semantically important regions akin to how skilled readers skip function words.<br /><br />4. Experimental results on eleven in-context learning benchmarks demonstrate that Vist matches accuracy with 2.3 times fewer tokens, reducing floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 16% and memory usage by 50%.<br /><br />5. Vist outperforms the strongest existing text-based compression method CEPE by 7.6% on average across benchmarks including TriviaQA, NQ, PopQA, NLUI, and CLIN, setting a new standard in token efficiency for LLMs. The project code is available at https://github.com/CSU-JPG/VIST. <div>

Abstract: Real-world applications are stretching context windows to hundreds of thousand of tokens while Large Language Models (LLMs) swell from billions to trillions of parameters. This dual expansion send compute and memory costs skyrocketing, making token compression indispensable. We introduce Vision Centric Token Compression (Vist), a slow-fast compression framework that mirrors human reading: the fast path renders distant tokens into images, letting a frozen, lightweight vision encoder skim the low-salience context; the slow path feeds the proximal window into the LLM for fine-grained reasoning. A Probability-Informed Visual Enhancement (PVE) objective masks high-frequency tokens during training, steering the Resampler to concentrate on semantically rich regions-just as skilled reader gloss over function words. On eleven in-context learning benchmarks, Vist achieves the same accuracy with 2.3 times fewer tokens, cutting FLOPs by 16% and memory by 50%. This method delivers remarkable results, outperforming the strongest text encoder-based compression method CEPE by 7.6% on average over benchmarks like TriviaQA, NQ, PopQA, NLUI, and CLIN, setting a new standard for token efficiency in LLMs. The project is at https://github.com/CSU-JPG/VIST.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, closed-source software, local LLMs, simulation frameworks  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This work investigates the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to improve the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) when working with closed-source simulation software, specifically the mesh-free simulation tool Pasimodo. Due to challenges like hallucinations from LLMs, especially with unknown or proprietary data, the study focuses on integrating external knowledge through RAG to enhance response accuracy. Tasks explored include smart-autocomplete, question answering via text extraction, model summarization, component explanation, compositional reasoning, and the generation of simulation components and input models. Prioritizing data protection and intellectual property rights, the evaluation emphasizes local LLM deployment rather than cloud-based solutions, making it more accessible for smaller institutions. Initial tests with smaller language models show promising yet imperfect results, with failures often linked to inadequate information supplied to the models. Various strategies to boost response quality were assessed, revealing that customizing the information fed to LLMs based on specific prompts markedly improves outcomes. Overall, the study highlights both the substantial potential of RAG-enhanced local LLMs in supporting closed-source simulation environments and the necessity for continued research to optimize information retrieval and model interaction for such specialized applications. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are tools that have become indispensable in development and programming. However, they suffer from hallucinations, especially when dealing with unknown knowledge. This is particularly the case when LLMs are to be used to support closed-source software applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an approach to use additional knowledge alongside the pre-trained knowledge of the LLM to respond to user prompts. Possible tasks range from a smart-autocomplete, text extraction for question answering, model summarization, component explaining, compositional reasoning, to creation of simulation components and complete input models. This work tests existing RAG systems for closed-source simulation frameworks, in our case the mesh-free simulation software Pasimodo. Since data protection and intellectual property rights are particularly important for problems solved with closed-source software, the tests focus on execution using local LLMs. In order to enable smaller institutions to use the systems, smaller language models will be tested first. The systems show impressive results, but often fail due to insufficient information. Different approaches for improving response quality are tested. In particular, tailoring the information provided to the LLMs dependent to the prompts proves to be a significant improvement. This demonstrates the great potential and the further work needed to improve information retrieval for closed-source simulation models.

<div> Keywords: large language models, task planning agents, user satisfaction, agent evaluation, AURA framework  

<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks for task planning agents, which mainly focus on task completion as a proxy for agent effectiveness. It argues that solely improving task completion does not necessarily maximize user satisfaction, since users experience the entire interactive process, not just the final output. To bridge this gap, the authors propose AURA, an Agent-User inteRaction Assessment framework that models the behavioral stages within interactive task planning agents. AURA provides a detailed assessment by applying atomic evaluation criteria based on large language models, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of strengths and weaknesses throughout the agent’s decision-making pipeline. Analysis using AURA reveals that different agents excel at different behavioral stages and emphasizes that user satisfaction depends on both final outcomes and intermediate behaviors. The study also discusses future directions, including the development of multi-agent systems and acknowledges the current limitations posed by user simulators in task planning contexts. By focusing on the interaction process as well as the results, AURA aims to improve the design and evaluation of task planning agents in realistic applications. <div>

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in instruction-following and context-understanding lead to the era of agents with numerous applications. Among these, task planning agents have become especially prominent in realistic scenarios involving complex internal pipelines, such as context understanding, tool management, and response generation. However, existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate agent performance based on task completion as a proxy for overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that merely improving task completion is misaligned with maximizing user satisfaction, as users interact with the entire agentic process and not only the end result. To address this gap, we propose AURA, an Agent-User inteRaction Assessment framework that conceptualizes the behavioral stages of interactive task planning agents. AURA offers a comprehensive assessment of agent through a set of atomic LLM evaluation criteria, allowing researchers and practitioners to diagnose specific strengths and weaknesses within the agent's decision-making pipeline. Our analyses show that agents excel in different behavioral stages, with user satisfaction shaped by both outcomes and intermediate behaviors. We also highlight future directions, including systems that leverage multiple agents and the limitations of user simulators in task planning.

<div> Keywords: large language models, sparse autoencoders, supervised steering, interpretable representations, behavior control  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper presents a novel method for controlling large language models (LLMs) through supervised steering in sparse, interpretable latent representation spaces. First, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to extract sparse latent representations that disentangle semantic attributes from the LLMs' activations. Second, linear classifiers identify a small subset of task-relevant latent dimensions, focusing the steering efforts on a well-defined subspace. Third, supervised steering vectors constrained to this subspace are learned and optimized to align generated outputs with desired target behaviors. The approach is evaluated on multiple tasks—sentiment control, truthfulness, and political polarity—across several LLMs. Results reveal that this method yields higher success rates in steering model behavior while maintaining minimal quality degradation in text generation compared to existing steering techniques. Further analysis demonstrates that an unexpectedly small subspace is sufficient for effective steering, which facilitates more targeted, efficient, and interpretable intervention mechanisms. Additionally, the implementation of this supervised steering approach, termed SAE-SSV, is publicly available, providing a valuable resource for further research and practical applications in controllable LLM generation. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but controlling their behavior reliably remains challenging, especially in open-ended generation settings. This paper introduces a novel supervised steering approach that operates in sparse, interpretable representation spaces. We employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to obtain sparse latent representations that aim to disentangle semantic attributes from model activations. Then we train linear classifiers to identify a small subspace of task-relevant dimensions in latent representations. Finally, we learn supervised steering vectors constrained to this subspace, optimized to align with target behaviors. Experiments across sentiment, truthfulness, and political polarity steering tasks with multiple LLMs demonstrate that our supervised steering vectors achieve higher success rates with minimal degradation in generation quality compared to existing methods. Further analysis reveals that a notably small subspace is sufficient for effective steering, enabling more targeted and interpretable interventions. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Ineedanamehere/SAE-SSV.

<div> Deep neural networks, semantic representations, large language models, vision transformers, information asymmetry<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article investigates how deep neural networks develop similar semantic representations for related data across different domains, such as images and their textual descriptions or multilingual text. The authors introduce a method to quantitatively measure the relative information content of these representations and analyze how semantic information is distributed across multiple tokens within large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Focusing initially on translated sentence pairs processed by LLMs, they identify specific "semantic" layers that contain the most transferable language information. It is observed that larger models, such as DeepSeek-V3, capture more general semantic information than smaller models like Llama3.1-8B. In English texts, semantic information spreads over many tokens and exhibits both long-distance correlations and a causal left-to-right asymmetry. Additionally, the study pinpoints semantic encoding layers within vision transformers, revealing that caption representations in LLM semantic layers can successfully predict corresponding image representations. Finally, significant and model-dependent asymmetries are found between image and text semantic representations, highlighting differences in how these modalities process and encode information. <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.

Abstract: Selective state-space models excel at long-sequence modeling, but their capacity for language representation -- in complex hierarchical reasoning -- remains underexplored. Most large language models rely on \textit{flat} Euclidean embeddings, limiting their ability to capture latent hierarchies. To address this, we propose {\it Hierarchical Mamba (HiM)}, integrating efficient Mamba2 with hyperbolic geometry to learn hierarchy-aware language embeddings for deeper linguistic understanding. Mamba2-processed sequences are projected to the Poincar\'e ball or Lorentzian manifold with ``learnable'' curvature, optimized with a hyperbolic loss. Our HiM model facilitates the capture of relational distances across varying hierarchical levels, enabling effective long-range reasoning for tasks like mixed-hop prediction and multi-hop inference in hierarchical classification. Experimental results show both HiM variants effectively capture hierarchical relationships across four linguistic and medical datasets, surpassing Euclidean baselines, with HiM-Poincar\'e providing fine-grained distinctions with higher h-norms, while HiM-Lorentz offers more stable, compact, and hierarchy-preserving embeddings-favoring robustness.

Abstract: As interest in using Large Language Models for interactive and emotionally rich experiences grows, virtual pet companionship emerges as a novel yet underexplored application. Existing approaches focus on basic pet role-playing interactions without systematically benchmarking LLMs for comprehensive companionship. In this paper, we introduce Pet-Bench, a dedicated benchmark that evaluates LLMs across both self-interaction and human-interaction dimensions. Unlike prior work, Pet-Bench emphasizes self-evolution and developmental behaviors alongside interactive engagement, offering a more realistic reflection of pet companionship. It features diverse tasks such as intelligent scheduling, memory-based dialogues, and psychological conversations, with over 7,500 interaction instances designed to simulate pet behaviors. Evaluation of 28 LLMs reveals significant performance variations linked to model size and inherent capabilities, underscoring the need for specialized optimization in this domain. Pet-Bench serves as a foundational resource for benchmarking pet-related LLM abilities and advancing emotionally immersive human-pet interactions.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition (NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels, they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly, ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts, we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English, Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting further improves performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods. Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism, caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original, filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight, occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted interventions, without the need for model retraining.

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is critical for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and comorbidities. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and medical text understanding, making them promising tools for drug recommendation tasks. However, the application of LLMs for Chinese clinical medication recommendation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of LLM-based methodologies for Chinese discharge medication recommendation. We evaluate several representative LLM families (GLM, Llama, Qwen) under a unified methodological framework including zero-shot prompting, in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and supervised fine-tuning using LoRA. We analyze model behavior across reasoning styles, error patterns, domain adaptation mechanisms, and robustness. Experimental results show that while supervised fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard score of 0.4477. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs for Chinese drug recommendation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: Group fairness is a central research topic in text classification, where reaching fair treatment between sensitive groups (e.g., women and men) remains an open challenge. We propose an approach that extends the use of the Wasserstein Dependency Measure for learning unbiased neural text classifiers. Given the challenge of distinguishing fair from unfair information in a text encoder, we draw inspiration from adversarial training by inducing independence between representations learned for the target label and those for a sensitive attribute. We further show that Domain Adaptation can be efficiently leveraged to remove the need for access to the sensitive attributes in the dataset we cure. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that our approach is well-founded.

arXiv:2506.13771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) often faces challenges from substantial memory and computational costs. Quantization offers a solution, yet performance degradation in the sub-1-bit regime remains particularly difficult. This paper introduces LittleBit, a novel method for extreme LLM compression. It targets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\times$ memory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW. LittleBit establishes a new, viable size-performance trade-off--unlocking a potential 11.6$\times$ speedup over FP16 at the kernel level--and makes powerful LLMs practical for resource-constrained environments. Our code can be found at https://github.com/SamsungLabs/LittleBit.

<title>IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks</title>

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems. Code and data are released under https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit over-refusal - erroneously rejecting benign queries due to overly conservative safety measures - a critical functional flaw that undermines their reliability and usability. Current methods for testing this behavior are demonstrably inadequate, suffering from flawed benchmarks and limited test generation capabilities, as highlighted by our empirical user study. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the systematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely integrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for comprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning LLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge model validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated over-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of leading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore, ORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly transferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal rate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets. ORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a valuable community resource, paving the way for developing more reliable and trustworthy LLM-based software systems.

arXiv:2508.16560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations, meant to correspond to interpretable concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many SAE features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity-reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value aside from its effect on reconstruction. In this work we study the effect of L0 on SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set correctly, the SAE fails to disentangle the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we present a proxy metric that can help guide the search for the correct L0 for an SAE on a given training distribution. We show that our method finds the correct L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLM SAEs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that L0 must be set correctly to train SAEs with correct features.

arXiv:2510.04996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model reasoning is frequently hindered by signal loss, a phenomenon where standard uniform sampling with small group sizes fails to uncover informative learning signals for difficult prompts. We demonstrate that this collapse is a statistical artifact of undersampling rather than an inherent model limitation. To address this systematically, we introduce a theoretical framework based on optimizing a non-linear RL objective (e.g., log-likelihood). We show that this objective naturally induces a weighted gradient estimator that prioritizes difficult prompts, which can be robustly realized through adaptive sampling. Guided by this framework, we propose Reinforce-Ada, a family of algorithms that dynamically allocates inference budgets based on prompt difficulty, effectively scaling up RL compute to where it is needed most. Unlike passive filtering methods that discard low-signal prompts, Reinforce-Ada actively invests compute to recover them. We introduce two efficient realizations: an estimation-based approach and a model-free sequential sampling approach. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada significantly outperforms uniform baselines like GRPO, recovering lost signals and accelerating convergence by up to $2\times$ while maintaining the same total inference budget. Code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.

The authors provide practical system and model design guidance based on their experiments. On the systems front, they deliver a detailed cluster and network characterization including microbenchmarking of core collective communication operations (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across different message sizes and GPU counts over Pollara, achieving a scale not previously reported. Additionally, they analyze MI300X performance focusing on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform architecture choices. On the modeling side, new MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules are introduced for attention and MLP blocks, along with optimally chosen MoE widths that balance training throughput with inference latency. The training stack description highlights fault-tolerance capabilities, checkpoint reshaping, and a detailed training recipe. The study also previews ZAYA1, a base MoE model with 8.3 billion total parameters (760 million active), released openly on Hugging Face, which matches or exceeds the performance of comparable base models such as Qwen3-4B, Gemma3-12B, and surpasses Llama-3-8B and OLMoE on reasoning, mathematics, and coding tasks.

Abstract: We report on the first large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) pretraining study on pure AMD hardware, utilizing both MI300X GPUs and Pollara networking. We distill practical guidance for both systems and model design. On the systems side, we deliver a comprehensive cluster and networking characterization: microbenchmarks for all core collectives (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across message sizes and GPU counts over Pollara. To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE, available at https://huggingface.co/Zyphra/ZAYA1-base) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers. ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models such as Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B at its scale and larger, and outperforms models including Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that the AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining.

<div> Keywords: Athena-PRM, process reward model, reasoning steps evaluation, prediction consistency, reward ranked fine-tuning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Athena-PRM is introduced as a multimodal process reward model designed to assign reward scores to each step in solving complex reasoning tasks. 2. Traditional high-performance process reward models require extensive step-level annotations, which are time-consuming and costly, while existing automated labeling methods such as Monte Carlo estimation are noisy and expensive computationally. 3. To address data quality and efficiency, the authors propose using prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a method to identify reliable process labels, enabling the generation of high-quality process-labeled data with only 5,000 samples. 4. Two additional strategies, ORM initialization and up-sampling of negative data, are developed to further enhance PRM performance. 5. The approach is validated in three scenarios: test time scaling verification, direct reasoning step correctness evaluation, and reward ranked fine-tuning, with Athena-PRM consistently outperforming existing methods. 6. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM improves benchmark scores by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 on MathVista during test time scaling. 7. Athena-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on VisualProcessBench, exceeding previous scores by 3.9 F1, demonstrating its accuracy in assessing reasoning step correctness. 8. Finally, by employing Athena-PRM as the reward model for reward ranked fine-tuning, Athena-7B significantly outperforms baselines across five benchmarks, highlighting its robust capability in complex reasoning evaluation. <div>

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: Tool-integrated reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, Lazy Likelihood Displacement, likelihood-preserving regularization, multi-hop question answering<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of training large language models (LLMs) with tool-integrated reinforcement learning (TIRL), where models interact with external tools like search engines for multi-step reasoning.<br /><br />2. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), exemplified by Search-R1, is a strong approach offering fast convergence and a value-free framework but suffers from training collapse.<br /><br />3. The authors identify Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), a phenomenon involving the systematic reduction or stagnation of both correct and incorrect response likelihoods, as the foundational cause of this collapse.<br /><br />4. LLD triggers a self-reinforcing "LLD Death Spiral" marked by low-confidence outputs, increased gradients, and eventual training collapse, progressing through three phases: early stagnation, steady decay, and accelerated collapse.<br /><br />5. To counter this, they propose a lightweight likelihood-preserving regularization method (LLDS) for GRPO that activates selectively when likelihoods decrease and applies fine-grained regularization only to responsible tokens.<br /><br />6. This approach mitigates LLD with minimal impact on optimization, stabilizes training, prevents gradient explosion, and delivers substantial performance improvements across seven QA benchmarks, including +37.8% on Qwen2.5-3B and +32.0% on Qwen2.5-7B.<br /><br />7. The work establishes LLD as a fundamental bottleneck in GRPO-based TIRL and offers a practical, scalable solution for stable training of tool-integrated LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Tool-integrated (TI) reinforcement learning (RL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning by interacting with external tools such as search engines and retrievers. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), exemplified by the recent Search-R1, offers fast convergence and a value-free formulation that makes it appealing for this setting, yet consistently suffers from training collapse. We identify Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), a systematic reduction or stagnation in the likelihood of both correct and incorrect responses, as the core mechanism driving this failure. LLD emerges early and triggers a self-reinforcing LLD Death Spiral, where declining likelihood leads to low-confidence responses, inflating gradients, and ultimately causing collapse. We empirically characterize this process across models on a Search-R1-style, search-integrated question answering task, revealing a consistent three-phase trajectory: early stagnation, steady decay, and accelerated collapse. To address this, we propose a lightweight likelihood-preserving regularization LLDS for GRPO that activates only when a trajectory's likelihood decreases, and regularizes only the tokens responsible. This fine-grained structure mitigates LLD with minimal interference to optimization. Across seven open-domain and multi-hop QA benchmarks, our method stabilizes training, prevents gradient explosion, and yields substantial performance improvements, including +37.8% gains on Qwen2.5-3B and +32.0% gains on Qwen2.5-7B. Our results establish LLD as a fundamental bottleneck in GRPO-based TIRL and provide a practical path toward stable, scalable training of tool-integrated LLM.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Libyan dialect, Arabic NLP, Multinomial Naive Bayes, n-gram features, dialect classification<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study explores the classification of Libyan dialect utterances sourced from Twitter using four machine learning models: logistic regression, linear support vector machine (SVM), multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), and Bernoulli Naive Bayes. The experiments utilize the QADI corpus, containing 540,000 sentences spanning 18 Arabic dialects, with special attention to the preprocessing challenges posed by inconsistent orthographic variations and non-standard spellings typical of the Libyan dialect. A chi-square feature analysis identified that certain meta-features such as email mentions and emotion indicators were not significantly linked to dialect classification and were therefore excluded. Two major experiments were conducted: the first assessed the value of meta-features using chi-square tests, and the second examined classifier performance with various word and character n-gram representations. Results demonstrated that MNB outperformed other models, achieving the highest accuracy (85.89%) and F1-score (0.85741) when using a combination of (1,2) word n-grams and (1,5) character n-grams. Logistic regression and linear SVM showed competitive but slightly lower accuracies of 84.41% and 84.73%, respectively. Additional evaluation metrics including log loss, Cohen’s kappa, and Matthew correlation coefficient further validated MNB’s superior performance. This work highlights the importance of selecting appropriate n-gram features and classification algorithms for effective Arabic dialect identification, providing valuable benchmarks for future research in Arabic dialect NLP. <div>

Abstract: This study investigates logistic regression, linear support vector machine, multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes for classifying Libyan dialect utterances gathered from Twitter. The dataset used is the QADI corpus, which consists of 540,000 sentences across 18 Arabic dialects. Preprocessing challenges include handling inconsistent orthographic variations and non-standard spellings typical of the Libyan dialect. The chi-square analysis revealed that certain features, such as email mentions and emotion indicators, were not significantly associated with dialect classification and were thus excluded from further analysis. Two main experiments were conducted: (1) evaluating the significance of meta-features extracted from the corpus using the chi-square test and (2) assessing classifier performance using different word and character n-gram representations. The classification experiments showed that Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) achieved the highest accuracy of 85.89% and an F1-score of 0.85741 when using a (1,2) word n-gram and (1,5) character n-gram representation. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Linear SVM exhibited slightly lower performance, with maximum accuracies of 84.41% and 84.73%, respectively. Additional evaluation metrics, including log loss, Cohen kappa, and Matthew correlation coefficient, further supported the effectiveness of MNB in this task. The results indicate that carefully selected n-gram representations and classification models play a crucial role in improving the accuracy of Libyan dialect identification. This study provides empirical benchmarks and insights for future research in Arabic dialect NLP applications.

<div> Keywords: spreadsheet question answering, multirow headers, hybrid retrieval, SQL relational representation, table understanding<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of accurate question answering over real spreadsheets, which is complicated by features such as multirow headers, merged cells, and unit annotations that disrupt simple chunking methods.<br /><br />2. Traditional rigid SQL views are insufficient for many spreadsheets due to inconsistent schemas, motivating a more flexible approach.<br /><br />3. The authors propose SQuARE, a hybrid retrieval framework that employs sheet-level complexity-aware routing. It calculates a continuous score based on header depth and merge density to decide the optimal retrieval path.<br /><br />4. Depending on the computed score, queries are routed through either structure-preserving chunk retrieval or SQL queries on an automatically created relational representation.<br /><br />5. A lightweight supervising agent manages retrieval, refinement, or combination of results from both paths when confidence is low to enhance accuracy.<br /><br />6. SQuARE preserves important spreadsheet features such as header hierarchies, time labels, and units, ensuring the returned answers align closely with original cell values and are easy to verify.<br /><br />7. Extensive evaluation on multi-header corporate balance sheets, a heavily merged World Bank workbook, and various public datasets shows that SQuARE consistently outperforms both single-strategy baselines and ChatGPT-4o in retrieval precision and answer accuracy.<br /><br />8. The system maintains predictable latency and separates retrieval from model choice, enabling compatibility with emerging tabular foundation models and improving robustness in table understanding tasks. <div>

Abstract: Accurate question answering over real spreadsheets remains difficult due to multirow headers, merged cells, and unit annotations that disrupt naive chunking, while rigid SQL views fail on files lacking consistent schemas. We present SQuARE, a hybrid retrieval framework with sheet-level, complexity-aware routing. It computes a continuous score based on header depth and merge density, then routes queries either through structure-preserving chunk retrieval or SQL over an automatically constructed relational representation. A lightweight agent supervises retrieval, refinement, or combination of results across both paths when confidence is low. This design maintains header hierarchies, time labels, and units, ensuring that returned values are faithful to the original cells and straightforward to verify. Evaluated on multi-header corporate balance sheets, a heavily merged World Bank workbook, and diverse public datasets, SQuARE consistently surpasses single-strategy baselines and ChatGPT-4o on both retrieval precision and end-to-end answer accuracy while keeping latency predictable. By decoupling retrieval from model choice, the system is compatible with emerging tabular foundation models and offers a practical bridge toward a more robust table understanding.

<div> Keywords: Data engineering, Data analysis, Autonomous agents, SQL pipelines, Benchmark

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces DAComp, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 210 tasks designed to emulate real-world enterprise data intelligence workflows, combining both data engineering (DE) and data analysis (DA). The DE tasks challenge systems to perform complex repository-level engineering over industrial-scale schemas, requiring the design, implementation, and evolution of multi-stage SQL pipelines. Conversely, the DA tasks focus on open-ended business problems that demand strategic planning, iterative exploratory coding, interpretation of intermediate results, and formulation of actionable insights. Evaluation of the DE tasks involves execution-based, multi-metric scoring, while DA tasks are assessed via a rigorously developed, hierarchical rubric-driven LLM-judge validated through experiments. Results show that leading autonomous agents struggle significantly on DAComp, especially in DE tasks, where success rates are under 20%, highlighting a critical bottleneck in managing integrated data pipelines beyond mere code generation. DA tasks also score below 40% on average, revealing substantial challenges in open-ended analytical reasoning, underscoring that engineering and analysis are distinct skills. By clearly identifying these gaps, DAComp serves as a realistic and rigorous testbed aimed at advancing the development of autonomous data agents capable of handling holistic data workflows in enterprise contexts. The dataset and codebase are openly available at the provided URL. <div>

Abstract: Real-world enterprise data intelligence workflows encompass data engineering that turns raw sources into analytical-ready tables and data analysis that convert those tables into decision-oriented insights. We introduce DAComp, a benchmark of 210 tasks that mirrors these complex workflows. Data engineering (DE) tasks require repository-level engineering on industrial schemas, including designing and building multi-stage SQL pipelines from scratch and evolving existing systems under evolving requirements. Data analysis (DA) tasks pose open-ended business problems that demand strategic planning, exploratory analysis through iterative coding, interpretation of intermediate results, and the synthesis of actionable recommendations. Engineering tasks are scored through execution-based, multi-metric evaluation. Open-ended tasks are assessed by a reliable, experimentally validated LLM-judge, which is guided by hierarchical, meticulously crafted rubrics. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents falter on DAComp. Performance on DE tasks is particularly low, with success rates under 20%, exposing a critical bottleneck in holistic pipeline orchestration, not merely code generation. Scores on DA tasks also average below 40%, highlighting profound deficiencies in open-ended reasoning and demonstrating that engineering and analysis are distinct capabilities. By clearly diagnosing these limitations, DAComp provides a rigorous and realistic testbed to drive the development of truly capable autonomous data agents for enterprise settings.

<div> Text clustering, large language models, domain-specific, embedding-guided, ClusterFusion<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses challenges in text clustering, particularly in domain-specific contexts where traditional clustering with pre-trained embeddings underperforms without expensive fine-tuning. The authors propose ClusterFusion, a novel hybrid framework that positions large language models (LLMs) as the central clustering mechanism rather than auxiliary tools. The approach integrates lightweight embedding methods in a three-stage process: first, embedding-guided subset partitioning organizes data subsets; second, LLM-driven topic summarization creates coherent cluster themes; third, LLM-based topic assignment labels documents according to these themes. This architecture allows for direct incorporation of domain knowledge and user preferences, leveraging LLMs’ contextual reasoning capabilities more effectively. The system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets and two newly constructed domain-specific datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard tasks and demonstrating significant improvements in specialized domains. To promote further research, the authors release their new dataset and results on all benchmarks. Overall, ClusterFusion advances text clustering by exploiting LLMs beyond refinement roles, providing a flexible, high-performance solution for both general and specialized NLP applications. <div>
arXiv:2512.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text clustering is a fundamental task in natural language processing, yet traditional clustering algorithms with pre-trained embeddings often struggle in domain-specific contexts without costly fine-tuning. Large language models (LLMs) provide strong contextual reasoning, yet prior work mainly uses them as auxiliary modules to refine embeddings or adjust cluster boundaries. We propose ClusterFusion, a hybrid framework that instead treats the LLM as the clustering core, guided by lightweight embedding methods. The framework proceeds in three stages: embedding-guided subset partition, LLM-driven topic summarization, and LLM-based topic assignment. This design enables direct incorporation of domain knowledge and user preferences, fully leveraging the contextual adaptability of LLMs. Experiments on three public benchmarks and two new domain-specific datasets demonstrate that ClusterFusion not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks but also delivers substantial gains in specialized domains. To support future work, we release our newly constructed dataset and results on all benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, SAT solving, natural language processing, CDCL, CNF conversion<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This paper introduces LangSAT, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize heuristic selection during the conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) process in SAT solving.<br /><br />2. LangSAT uniquely bridges natural language and propositional logic by allowing English descriptions as input, which are converted into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) expressions, overcoming the limitation of traditional SAT solvers that require CNF inputs.<br /><br />3. The framework consists of two main components: Lang2Logic, which translates English sentences into CNF formulas, and SmartSAT, an RL-enhanced SAT solver.<br /><br />4. SmartSAT encodes the relationship between clauses and variables using structured graph representations and extracts global features, providing the RL agent with richer contextual information for improved solving efficiency.<br /><br />5. Evaluations show Lang2Logic effectively processes natural language inputs up to 450 words, and SmartSAT achieves solving times comparable to traditional CDCL heuristics, making LangSAT a more accessible and scalable SAT-solving solution applicable to reasoning, formal verification, and debugging tasks. <div>

Abstract: Our work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to optimize heuristic selection within the conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) process, improving the efficiency of Boolean satisfia- bility (SAT) solving. The proposed system, LangSAT, bridges the gap between natural language inputs and propositional logic by converting English descriptions into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) expressions and solving them using an RL-enhanced CDCL SAT solver. Unlike existing SAT-solving platforms that require CNF as input, LangSAT enables users to input standard English descriptions, making SAT-solving more accessible. The framework comprises two key components: Lang2Logic, which translates English sentences into CNF expressions, and SmartSAT, an RL-based SAT solver. SmartSAT encodes clause-variable relationships as structured graph representations and extracts global features specific to the SAT problem. This implementation provides the RL agent with deeper contextual information, enabling SAT problems to be solved more efficiently. Lang2Logic was evaluated on diverse natural language inputs, processing descriptions up to 450 words. The generated CNFs were solved by SmartSAT, which demonstrated comparable performance to traditional CDCL heuristics with respect to solving time. The combined LangSAT framework offers a more accessible and scalable solution for SAT-solving tasks across reasoning, formal verification, and debugging.

<title>MASE: Interpretable NLP Models via Model-Agnostic Saliency Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Deep Neural Networks, Interpretability, Model-agnostic Saliency Estimation, Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations, Natural Language Processing<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting deep neural networks (DNNs) in natural language processing (NLP), where understanding model decisions remains difficult due to the discrete nature of text data. Traditional interpretation techniques such as saliency maps and feature visualization often fall short when applied to NLP models. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose the Model-agnostic Saliency Estimation (MASE) framework, which provides local explanations of text-based predictive models without requiring detailed knowledge of their internal architectures. MASE innovates by applying Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations (NLGP) to the embedding layer rather than the raw word inputs, which enhances efficiency and accuracy in estimating input saliency. Experimental results demonstrate that MASE outperforms existing model-agnostic interpretability methods, particularly in terms of Delta Accuracy, a metric for measuring the impact of identified salient features on model predictions. The framework offers a promising approach for researchers and practitioners seeking transparent insights into complex NLP models, potentially aiding in debugging, trust-building, and compliance with interpretability requirements. Overall, MASE represents a significant advancement in the field of explainable NLP by bridging the gap between model performance and interpretability. <div>
arXiv:2512.04386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet their interpretability remains elusive, particularly when evaluating their intricate decision-making processes. Traditional methods often rely on post-hoc interpretations, such as saliency maps or feature visualization, which might not be directly applicable to the discrete nature of word data in NLP. Addressing this, we introduce the Model-agnostic Saliency Estimation (MASE) framework. MASE offers local explanations for text-based predictive models without necessitating in-depth knowledge of a model's internal architecture. By leveraging Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations (NLGP) on the embedding layer instead of raw word inputs, MASE efficiently estimates input saliency. Our results indicate MASE's superiority over other model-agnostic interpretation methods, especially in terms of Delta Accuracy, positioning it as a promising tool for elucidating the operations of text-based models in NLP.

<div> sarcasm detection, classical machine learning, feature engineering, TF-IDF, Reddit SARC 2.0<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper investigates sarcasm detection in online comments using classical machine learning methods without the use of neural networks or contextual information from parent comments.  
2. The study utilizes a subset of 100,000 comments from the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC 2.0) to build and evaluate models.  
3. Feature engineering involves combining word-level and character-level TF-IDF vectors with simple stylistic indicators to represent the text data.  
4. Four classical models are tested: logistic regression, linear SVM, multinomial Naive Bayes, and random forest.  
5. Among these, logistic regression and multinomial Naive Bayes perform best, achieving F1-scores of approximately 0.57 in identifying sarcastic comments.  
6. The research highlights that the absence of conversational context restricts overall detection performance, yet the models provide a reproducible, transparent, and computationally lightweight baseline for sarcasm detection tasks.  
7. The approach emphasizes interpretability and simplicity, offering a useful benchmark for future work involving sarcasm recognition in text without heavy reliance on deep learning or external context. <div>
arXiv:2512.04396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sarcasm is common in online discussions, yet difficult for machines to identify because the intended meaning often contradicts the literal wording. In this work, I study sarcasm detection using only classical machine learning methods and explicit feature engineering, without relying on neural networks or context from parent comments. Using a 100,000-comment subsample of the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC 2.0), I combine word-level and character-level TF-IDF features with simple stylistic indicators. Four models are evaluated: logistic regression, a linear SVM, multinomial Naive Bayes, and a random forest. Naive Bayes and logistic regression perform the strongest, achieving F1-scores around 0.57 for sarcastic comments. Although the lack of conversational context limits performance, the results offer a clear and reproducible baseline for sarcasm detection using lightweight and interpretable methods.

<div> unlearning, large language models, influence estimation, parameter efficiency, adaptive updates<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Removing specific data influence from large language models (LLMs) is difficult due to the high cost of retraining and instability in current approximate unlearning methods. 2. The problem becomes more pronounced when the dataset to be forgotten is small or imbalanced. 3. RapidUn is proposed as a novel unlearning framework that is both influence-driven and parameter-efficient, enabling selective forgetting without full retraining. 4. The method involves a fast estimation module that calculates per-sample influence, which is then converted into adaptive update weights to selectively adjust model parameters. 5. This selective updating helps RapidUn forget harmful behaviors while preserving the model’s general knowledge. 6. Experiments on Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B using Dolly-15k and Alpaca-57k datasets demonstrate that RapidUn achieves up to 100 times greater efficiency compared to full retraining. 7. RapidUn consistently outperforms existing methods such as Fisher, GA, and LoReUn on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution forgetting tasks. 8. Overall, influence-guided parameter reweighting is established as a scalable, interpretable, and effective approach for unlearning in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Removing specific data influence from large language models (LLMs) remains challenging, as retraining is costly and existing approximate unlearning methods are often unstable. The challenge is exacerbated when the forget set is small or imbalanced. We introduce RapidUn, an influence-driven and parameter-efficient unlearning framework. It first estimates per-sample influence through a fast estimation module, then maps these scores into adaptive update weights that guide selective parameter updates -- forgetting harmful behavior while retaining general knowledge. On Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B across Dolly-15k and Alpaca-57k, RapidUn achieves up to 100 times higher efficiency than full retraining and consistently outperforms Fisher, GA, and LoReUn on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution forgetting. These results establish influence-guided parameter reweighting as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for LLM unlearning.

<title>MSME: A Multi-Stage Multi-Expert Framework for Zero-Shot Stance Detection</title>

<div> Keywords: zero-shot stance detection, multi-stage framework, expert reasoning, rhetorical devices, background knowledge<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Large language model (LLM)-based methods have recently shown strong zero-shot stance detection capabilities but fall short in complex real-world contexts where stance requires nuanced understanding.<br /><br />2. Challenges include the need for dynamic background knowledge, handling compound or event-based targets tied explicitly to stance labels, and detecting rhetorical devices like irony that mask true intent.<br /><br />3. To tackle these, the authors propose MSME, a Multi-Stage, Multi-Expert framework composed of three main stages: Knowledge Preparation, Expert Reasoning, and Decision Aggregation.<br /><br />4. In Knowledge Preparation, relevant background knowledge is retrieved and stance labels are clarified to set a solid foundation for downstream processing.<br /><br />5. Expert Reasoning consists of three specialized experts: the Knowledge Expert extracts key facts and reasons; the Label Expert refines stance labels and their justifications; the Pragmatic Expert identifies rhetorical cues such as irony to infer the author’s pragmatic intent.<br /><br />6. In the final stage, Decision Aggregation, a Meta-Judge module synthesizes the insights from all experts to produce the final stance prediction.<br /><br />7. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that MSME noticeably outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot stance detection methods across all benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: LLM-based approaches have recently achieved impressive results in zero-shot stance detection. However, they still struggle in complex real-world scenarios, where stance understanding requires dynamic background knowledge, target definitions involve compound entities or events that must be explicitly linked to stance labels, and rhetorical devices such as irony often obscure the author's actual intent. To address these challenges, we propose MSME, a Multi-Stage, Multi-Expert framework for zero-shot stance detection. MSME consists of three stages: (1) Knowledge Preparation, where relevant background knowledge is retrieved and stance labels are clarified; (2) Expert Reasoning, involving three specialized modules-Knowledge Expert distills salient facts and reasons from a knowledge perspective, Label Expert refines stance labels and reasons accordingly, and Pragmatic Expert detects rhetorical cues such as irony to infer intent from a pragmatic angle; (3) Decision Aggregation, where a Meta-Judge integrates all expert analyses to produce the final stance prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that MSME achieves state-of-the-art performance across the board.

<div> ChemoTimelines, chemotherapy timeline extraction, LLM, supervised fine-tuning, electronic health records<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the ChemoTimelines shared task, which aims to benchmark methods for constructing timelines of systemic anticancer treatments from the electronic health records (EHRs) of cancer patients. The focus is on subtask 2, which involves generating detailed chemotherapy timelines from raw clinical notes. The authors evaluated several strategies to improve timeline extraction, including chain-of-thought prompting, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and dictionary-based lookup techniques. The overall approach followed a two-step workflow: first, a large language model (LLM) extracted chemotherapy events from individual clinical notes, and second, a separate algorithm normalized and aggregated these events into coherent patient-level timelines. Different methods mainly varied in how the LLM was trained and utilized within this framework. Among the tested approaches, fine-tuning the Qwen3-14B model delivered the best official score of 0.678 on the leaderboard, indicating competitive performance. The results and analyses presented offer valuable insights for future efforts in chemotherapy timeline extraction as well as for designing similar clinical timeline construction tasks. This work contributes to advancing AI methodologies for processing complex, unstructured clinical data to facilitate oncology research and care planning. <div>

Abstract: The ChemoTimelines shared task benchmarks methods for constructing timelines of systemic anticancer treatment from electronic health records of cancer patients. This paper describes our methods, results, and findings for subtask 2 -- generating patient chemotherapy timelines from raw clinical notes. We evaluated strategies involving chain-of-thought thinking, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and dictionary-based lookup to improve timeline extraction. All of our approaches followed a two-step workflow, wherein an LLM first extracted chemotherapy events from individual clinical notes, and then an algorithm normalized and aggregated events into patient-level timelines. Each specific method differed in how the associated LLM was utilized and trained. Multiple approaches yielded competitive performances on the test set leaderboard, with fine-tuned Qwen3-14B achieving the best official score of 0.678. Our results and analyses could provide useful insights for future attempts on this task as well as the design of similar tasks.

<div> Keywords: Lifelong Free-text Knowledge Editing, large language models, knowledge updating, continual editing, EvoEdit<br /><br />Summary: Adjusting outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs) after deployment is challenging, motivating the development of knowledge editing to efficiently modify internal knowledge without full retraining. Current methods have two major limitations: reliance on structured triplets that do not align well with the free-text format of LLM pretraining, and limited support for sequential or lifelong knowledge updates. To overcome these, the authors propose a new task called Lifelong Free-text Knowledge Editing (LF-Edit), which allows models to incorporate natural language updates and supports continual editing over time. LF-Edit faces challenges in integrating new knowledge while preventing forgetting of previous knowledge. To facilitate research, the authors create a large-scale benchmark named Multi-Rank Lifelong Free-text Editing Benchmark (MRLF-Bench) with 16,835 free-text editing requests and a multi-level evaluation framework assessing memorization, understanding, constrained comprehension, and reasoning. They introduce EvoEdit, a novel method that improves knowledge injection through Latent Perturbation Augmentation and preserves prior information using Knowledge-driven Parameter Fusion. Experiments demonstrate that EvoEdit significantly outperforms existing knowledge editing methods on the LF-Edit task, marking a substantial advance in lifelong free-text knowledge editing for LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Adjusting the outdated knowledge of large language models (LLMs) after deployment remains a major challenge. This difficulty has spurred the development of knowledge editing, which seeks to accurately and efficiently modify a model's internal (parametric) knowledge without retraining it from scratch. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations. First, they depend on structured triplets that are misaligned with the free-text nature of LLM pretraining and fail to capture the nuanced relationships among facts. Second, they typically support one-time knowledge updates, with relatively limited research on the problem of sequential or lifelong editing. To address these gaps, we propose a new task, Lifelong Free-text Knowledge Editing (LF-Edit), which enables models to incorporate updates expressed in natural language and supports continual editing over time. Despite its promise, LF-Edit faces the dual challenge of integrating new knowledge while mitigating the forgetting of prior information. To foster research on this new task, we construct a large-scale benchmark, Multi-Rank Lifelong Free-text Editing Benchmark (MRLF-Bench), containing 16,835 free-text edit requests. We further design a cognitively inspired multi-rank evaluation framework encompassing four levels: memorization, understanding, constrained comprehension, and reasoning. To tackle the challenges inherent in LF-Edit, we introduce a novel approach named EvoEdit that enhances knowledge injection through Latent Perturbation Augmentation and preserves prior information via Knowledge-driven Parameter Fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoEdit substantially outperforms existing knowledge editing methods on the proposed LF-Edit task.

<title>AdmTree: Compressing Lengthy Context with Adaptive Semantic Trees</title>

<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04550</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: self-attention, context compression, hierarchical abstraction, semantic fidelity, Large Language Models<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Large Language Models (LLMs), which limits their ability to process long context sequences necessary for advanced applications. It identifies the shortcomings of existing context compression methods: explicit approaches often lose local detail, while implicit ones may introduce positional biases, degrade information, or fail to capture long-range semantic dependencies. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose AdmTree, an adaptive, hierarchical context compression framework focused on preserving semantic fidelity efficiently. AdmTree dynamically segments input sequences based on information density, summarizing variable-length segments into gist tokens that form the leaves of a semantic binary tree. This hierarchical structure, combined with a lightweight aggregation mechanism and a frozen backbone LLM (minimizing new trainable parameters), supports efficient context abstraction. Importantly, AdmTree preserves fine-grained details alongside global semantic coherence, mitigates positional bias, and dynamically adapts compression according to content characteristics. Together, these features enable AdmTree to maintain the semantic integrity of long contexts while reducing computational complexity, making it a robust solution for enhancing the processing capabilities of LLMs with extended inputs. <div>

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention constrains Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing long contexts, a capability essential for many advanced applications. Context compression aims to alleviate this computational bottleneck while retaining critical semantic information. However, existing approaches often fall short: explicit methods may compromise local detail, whereas implicit methods can suffer from positional biases, information degradation, or an inability to capture long-range semantic dependencies. We propose AdmTree, a novel framework for adaptive, hierarchical context compression with a central focus on preserving high semantic fidelity while maintaining efficiency. AdmTree dynamically segments input based on information density, utilizing gist tokens to summarize variable-length segments as the leaves of a semantic binary tree. This structure, together with a lightweight aggregation mechanism and a frozen backbone LLM (thereby minimizing new trainable parameters), enables efficient hierarchical abstraction of the context. By preserving fine-grained details alongside global semantic coherence, mitigating positional bias, and dynamically adapting to content, AdmTree robustly retains the semantic information of long contexts.

<title>ADAPT: Learning Task Mixtures for Budget-Constrained Instruction Tuning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04555</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04555</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: meta-learning, task sampling, token budget, multi-task instruction tuning, adaptive curriculum<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper introduces ADAPT, a meta-learning algorithm designed to optimize task sampling proportions within a fixed token budget for multi-task instruction tuning.  
2. Unlike traditional methods that assign fixed task weights manually, ADAPT maintains a dynamic distribution over tasks, adjusting it through meta-gradients derived from a smooth worst-case validation objective.  
3. This approach creates an adaptive curriculum that strategically allocates more tokens to tasks deemed more useful, while preventing the collapse of training focus.  
4. The algorithm was implemented on three approximately 1-billion-parameter open-weight large language models (Gemma-3-1B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, Qwen-0.6B) and was evaluated under token budgets representing 1%, 5%, and 10% of the available supervised tokens.  
5. Training was conducted across 20 distinct task types from the Natural Instructions dataset and benchmarked on 11 diverse out-of-domain datasets covering reasoning, reading comprehension, code generation, and instruction following.  
6. Empirical results reveal that ADAPT matches or slightly exceeds the performance of the best static task mixtures while utilizing fewer effective training tokens.  
7. It also reallocates token budgets towards more challenging tasks that better align with benchmark requirements, illustrating the benefits of adaptive task sampling in multi-task instruction tuning. <div>

Abstract: We propose ADAPT, a meta-learning algorithm that \emph{learns} task sampling proportions under an explicit token budget for multi-task instruction tuning. Instead of fixing task weights by hand, \adapt{} maintains a continuous distribution over tasks and updates it via meta-gradients of a smooth worst-case validation objective, inducing an adaptive curriculum that allocates more tokens to useful tasks while avoiding collapse. We instantiate ADAPT on three $\sim$1B-parameter open-weight LLMs (Gemma-3-1B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, Qwen-0.6B), training on 20 Natural Instructions task types under budgets of $1\%$, $5\%$, and $10\%$ of the available supervised tokens, and compare against strong supervised fine-tuning baselines with uniform and size-proportional mixing. We conduct evaluations on 11 out-of-domain benchmarks spanning reasoning, reading comprehension, code generation, and instruction following, we find that ADAPT matches or slightly improves average downstream performance relative to the best static mixture, while using fewer effective training tokens and reallocating budget toward harder, benchmark-aligned tasks.

<div> Legal general intelligence, large language models, Chinese legal benchmark, LexGenius, artificial intelligence<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article introduces Legal General Intelligence (GI), a form of artificial intelligence tailored to replicate legal expertise in understanding, reasoning, and decision-making across various legal domains. Existing benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in legal tasks are predominantly result-oriented and do not adequately measure legal intelligence capabilities, which limits progress in the development of legal GI. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose LexGenius, an expert-level benchmark specifically designed for the Chinese legal context. LexGenius employs a Dimension-Task-Ability framework that encompasses seven dimensions, eleven tasks, and twenty abilities, providing a comprehensive evaluation structure. The benchmark dataset consists of multiple-choice questions based on recent legal cases and examination questions, created through a combination of manual curation and LLM-assisted reviews to minimize data leakage and ensure high accuracy and reliability validated by multiple review rounds. The study evaluates 12 state-of-the-art LLMs using LexGenius, revealing significant inconsistencies in legal intelligence abilities across different models, and notably that even the best-performing LLMs fall short of human legal professionals. The authors argue that LexGenius is a critical tool for assessing and advancing legal intelligence in LLMs. Their project and resources are publicly accessible at https://github.com/QwenQKing/LexGenius. <div>

Abstract: Legal general intelligence (GI) refers to artificial intelligence (AI) that encompasses legal understanding, reasoning, and decision-making, simulating the expertise of legal experts across domains. However, existing benchmarks are result-oriented and fail to systematically evaluate the legal intelligence of large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of legal GI. To address this, we propose LexGenius, an expert-level Chinese legal benchmark for evaluating legal GI in LLMs. It follows a Dimension-Task-Ability framework, covering seven dimensions, eleven tasks, and twenty abilities. We use the recent legal cases and exam questions to create multiple-choice questions with a combination of manual and LLM reviews to reduce data leakage risks, ensuring accuracy and reliability through multiple rounds of checks. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs using LexGenius and conduct an in-depth analysis. We find significant disparities across legal intelligence abilities for LLMs, with even the best LLMs lagging behind human legal professionals. We believe LexGenius can assess the legal intelligence abilities of LLMs and enhance legal GI development. Our project is available at https://github.com/QwenQKing/LexGenius.

<div> Generic masculines, German press texts, personal nouns, corpus analysis, psycholinguistics  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study focuses on the distribution and linguistic features of generic masculines (GM) in contemporary German press texts. It addresses the ongoing debate about whether masculine personal nouns used for mixed-gender groups or unspecified individuals are truly gender-neutral. Prior psycholinguistic research indicates that GM tends to be more associated with male referents, yet corpus-based examinations of actual usage have been limited. The researchers analyzed a large corpus of press texts, manually annotating 6,195 tokens across the full inflectional paradigms of 21 personal nouns. Key findings highlight significant differences between lexical items, notably between passive role nouns and prestige-related personal nouns. Grammatically, GM predominantly occurs in the plural form and within indefinite noun phrases. Contrary to some previous assumptions, the data suggest that GM is not primarily used to denote entire classes of people. By providing empirical evidence based on authentic written language, this study offers a more nuanced understanding of the forms and usage of GM. These insights also serve to better align linguistic stimuli in psycholinguistic research with real-world language practice. <div>

Abstract: This study examines the distribution and linguistic characteristics of generic masculines (GM) in contemporary German press texts. The use of masculine personal nouns to refer to mixed-gender groups or unspecified individuals has been widely debated in academia and the public, with con-flicting perspectives on its gender-neutrality. While psycholinguistic studies suggest that GM is more readily associated with male referents, corpus-based analyses of its actual use remain scarce. We investigate GM in a large corpus of press texts, focusing on lexeme-specific differences across dif-ferent types of personal nouns. We conducted manual annotations of the whole inflectional para-digm of 21 personal nouns, resulting in 6,195 annotated tokens. Our findings reveal considerable differences between lexical items, especially between passive role nouns and prestige-related per-sonal nouns. On a grammatical level, we find that GM occurs predominantly in the plural and in indefinite noun phrases. Furthermore, our data shows that GM is not primarily used to denote entire classes of people, as has been previously claimed. By providing an empirical insight into the use of GM in authentic written language, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of its forms and manifestations. These findings provide a solid basis for aligning linguistic stimuli in psy-cholinguistic studies more closely with real-world language use.

<div> Keywords: OsmT, OverpassQL, Tag Retrieval Augmentation, OpenStreetMap, natural language interface  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of bridging natural language and structured query languages, focusing on geospatial data access through Overpass Query Language (OverpassQL) for OpenStreetMap (OSM). The authors introduce OsmT, an open-source, tag-aware language model crafted to translate natural language queries into OverpassQL with high accuracy and structural validity. A novel Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA) mechanism is implemented to embed contextually relevant tag information during query generation, capturing the hierarchical and relational dependencies inherent to OSM’s complex topology. Furthermore, the study defines a reverse task—OverpassQL-to-Text—that converts structured queries back into natural language explanations, enhancing user accessibility and query interpretation. OsmT is evaluated on a public benchmark dataset and outperforms strong baselines consistently in both translation directions. Notably, despite employing significantly fewer parameters than large closed-source models, OsmT achieves competitive accuracy, highlighting the practicality and effectiveness of open-source pre-trained language models in handling schema-rich, geospatial query environments while enabling more transparent, adaptable, and cost-efficient deployments. <div>

Abstract: Bridging natural language and structured query languages is a long-standing challenge in the database community. While recent advances in language models have shown promise in this direction, existing solutions often rely on large-scale closed-source models that suffer from high inference costs, limited transparency, and lack of adaptability for lightweight deployment. In this paper, we present OsmT, an open-source tag-aware language model specifically designed to bridge natural language and Overpass Query Language (OverpassQL), a structured query language for accessing large-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. To enhance the accuracy and structural validity of generated queries, we introduce a Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA) mechanism that incorporates contextually relevant tag knowledge into the generation process. This mechanism is designed to capture the hierarchical and relational dependencies present in the OSM database, addressing the topological complexity inherent in geospatial query formulation. In addition, we define a reverse task, OverpassQL-to-Text, which translates structured queries into natural language explanations to support query interpretation and improve user accessibility. We evaluate OsmT on a public benchmark against strong baselines and observe consistent improvements in both query generation and interpretation. Despite using significantly fewer parameters, our model achieves competitive accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of open-source pre-trained language models in bridging natural language and structured query languages within schema-rich geospatial environments.

<title>SignRoundV2: Closing the Performance Gap in Extremely Low-Bit Post-Training Quantization for LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Low-bit quantization, Large Language Models, SignRoundV2, post-training quantization, bit allocation<br /><br />Summary:  
Extreme low-bit quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently but usually causes significant performance drops at 2-bit and 4-bit precision levels. The paper introduces SignRoundV2, a novel post-training quantization framework designed to operate effectively without relying on mixed-precision strategies. SignRoundV2 incorporates two key innovations: first, a fast sensitivity metric that integrates gradient information with quantization-induced deviations to guide optimal layer-wise bit allocation; second, a lightweight pre-tuning search mechanism for quantization scales which enhances performance under extremely low-bit constraints. These design elements enable SignRoundV2 to bridge the accuracy gap relative to full-precision models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method maintains competitive accuracy for LLMs, achieving production-grade results with only about 1 percent variance at 4-5 bits precision and strong performance even at 2 bits. The approach thus offers a practical and effective solution for low-bit quantization in large-scale language models. The implementation of SignRoundV2 is publicly available at https://github.com/intel/auto-round, facilitating adoption and further research. <div>

Abstract: Extreme low-bit quantization is critical for efficiently deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it often leads to severe performance degradation at 2-bits and even 4-bits (e.g., MXFP4). We present SignRoundV2, a post-training quantization framework that is highly effective even without mixed-precision. SignRoundV2 introduces (1) a fast sensitivity metric that combines gradient information with quantization-induced deviations to guide layer-wise bit allocation, and (2) a lightweight pre-tuning search for quantization scales to improve extremely low-bit quantization. These components allow SignRoundV2 to close the gap with full-precision models. Extensive experiments indicate that our method sustains competitive accuracy for LLMs, achieving production-grade performance with about 1 percent variance at 4-5 bits and strong results even at 2 bits.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Test-Time Adaptation, Test-Time Steering Vectors, Model Confidence, Task Generalization

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) on specific tasks or new data distributions without tuning the model parameters. Existing test-time adaptation methods require parameter updates, causing computational costs and potential degradation of the model's original capabilities. To overcome this, the authors propose Test-Time Steering Vectors (TTSV), a lightweight vector prepended to the model input that keeps the LLM's parameters completely frozen. TTSV is optimized on test data by minimizing the model's output entropy, which steers the LLM toward a higher-confidence internal state, thus activating its relevant reasoning skills. The approach is computationally efficient and can be easily plugged into different settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate TTSV’s effectiveness on both base and reasoning-enhanced LLMs. For example, on the MATH500 task, TTSV yields a 45.88% relative performance improvement for the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model and a 16.22% gain for the Qwen3-4B model. Moreover, TTSV exhibits strong generalization, as steering vectors optimized for one task transfer well to various other tasks, showcasing its robustness and broad applicability. <div>

Abstract: It is a critical challenge to efficiently unlock the powerful reasoning potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks or new distributions. Existing test-time adaptation methods often require tuning model parameters, which is not only computationally expensive but also risks degrading the model's pre-existing abilities.To address this, we introduce a lightweight component, Test-Time Steering Vectors (TTSV), which is prepended to the input while keeping the LLM's parameters entirely frozen. By optimizing the TTSV on test data to minimize the model's output entropy, we steer the model towards an internal state of higher confidence, activating its inherent abilities most relevant to the current task. TTSV is both lightweight and highly efficient to optimize, making it a true plug-and-play enhancement. Extensive experiments validate our approach's effectiveness on both base models and reasoning-enhanced models. For instance, on the MATH500 task, TTSV achieves a 45.88% relative performance gain on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model and a 16.22% relative gain on the Qwen3-4B model. Furthermore, our approach exhibits robust generalization, with its steering vectors proving highly transferable across diverse tasks.

<div> Keywords: knowledge editing, large language models, overfitting, policy optimization, consolidation

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of updating specific facts in large language models (LLMs) without full retraining, focusing on the gap between controlled evaluations and real-world lifelong learning performance. First, it identifies two key issues in existing knowledge editing methods: they tend to overfit the model to new facts, which harms previously learned capabilities, and lack a knowledge consolidation phase, causing edited facts to fail in influencing actual autoregressive generation effectively. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a novel paradigm called Edit-then-Consolidate. The approach consists of two stages: (1) Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT), which avoids overfitting by applying a trust-region constraint that limits policy drift and localizes the edit, and (2) a consolidation phase that employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to align the edited knowledge with chain-of-thought (CoT) inference policies by optimizing trajectory-level generation behavior under comprehensive reward criteria. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this framework enhances the reliability and generalization of knowledge edits in real-world settings, better retains locality of edits, and preserves pre-trained abilities, thus bridging the gap between theoretical editing methods and practical applicability in dynamic LLM usage scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2512.04753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to update specific facts in large language models (LLMs) without full retraining. Prior efforts sought to tune the knowledge layers of LLMs, proving effective for making selective edits. However, a significant gap exists between their performance in controlled, teacher-forcing evaluations and their real-world effectiveness in lifelong learning scenarios, which greatly limits their practical applicability. This work's empirical analysis reveals two recurring issues associated with this gap: (1) Most traditional methods lead the edited model to overfit to the new fact, thereby degrading pre-trained capabilities; (2) There is a critical absence of a knowledge consolidation stage, leaving new facts insufficiently integrated into LLMs' inference-time behavior under autoregressive generation, thereby leading to a mismatch between parametric knowledge and actual generation behavior. To this end, we propose Edit-then-Consolidate, a novel knowledge editing paradigm that aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge editing methods and their real-world applicability. Specifically, (1) our framework mitigates overfitting via Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT) that localizes the edit via a trust-region objective to limit policy drift; (2) Then, a consolidation stage using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) aligns the edited knowledge with CoT-based inference policy by optimizing trajectory-level behavior under comprehensive reward signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework consistently improves editing reliability and generalization under real-world evaluations, while better preserving locality and pre-trained capabilities.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Italian, benchmarking, evaluation pipeline, community collaboration<br /><br />Summary: The paper introduces CALAMITA, a large-scale collaborative benchmarking initiative focused on evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for the Italian language. Unlike previous approaches that emphasize leaderboards, CALAMITA prioritizes methodology by bringing together over 80 contributors from academia, industry, and the public sector. The initiative covers a wide range of tasks including linguistic competence, commonsense reasoning, factual consistency, fairness, summarization, translation, and code generation. It compiles a comprehensive benchmark consisting of more than 20 tasks and nearly 100 subtasks, supported by a centralized evaluation pipeline designed to handle diverse datasets and metrics. The authors present evaluation results of four open-weight LLMs, identifying their systematic strengths and weaknesses across different abilities, while acknowledging challenges related to task-specific evaluation. Beyond numerical results, CALAMITA reveals key methodological insights such as the need for detailed, task-representative metrics, the significance of harmonized evaluation pipelines, and the advantages and constraints of engaging a broad community. Designed as a rolling benchmark, CALAMITA supports ongoing updates with new tasks and models, making it both a valuable resource for Italian LLM evaluation and a sustainable framework. The paper suggests that this approach can serve as a model for other languages and communities aiming for inclusive and thorough LLM assessments. <div>

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed natural language processing and broadened its impact across research and society. Yet, systematic evaluation of these models, especially for languages beyond English, remains limited. "Challenging the Abilities of LAnguage Models in ITAlian" (CALAMITA) is a large-scale collaborative benchmarking initiative for Italian, coordinated under the Italian Association for Computational Linguistics. Unlike existing efforts that focus on leaderboards, CALAMITA foregrounds methodology: it federates more than 80 contributors from academia, industry, and the public sector to design, document, and evaluate a diverse collection of tasks, covering linguistic competence, commonsense reasoning, factual consistency, fairness, summarization, translation, and code generation. Through this process, we not only assembled a benchmark of over 20 tasks and almost 100 subtasks, but also established a centralized evaluation pipeline that supports heterogeneous datasets and metrics. We report results for four open-weight LLMs, highlighting systematic strengths and weaknesses across abilities, as well as challenges in task-specific evaluation. Beyond quantitative results, CALAMITA exposes methodological lessons: the necessity of fine-grained, task-representative metrics, the importance of harmonized pipelines, and the benefits and limitations of broad community engagement. CALAMITA is conceived as a rolling benchmark, enabling continuous integration of new tasks and models. This makes it both a resource -- the most comprehensive and diverse benchmark for Italian to date -- and a framework for sustainable, community-driven evaluation. We argue that this combination offers a blueprint for other languages and communities seeking inclusive and rigorous LLM evaluation practices.

<div> Keywords: large language models, tribal languages, machine translation, participatory data creation, equitable AI<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces AdiBhashaa, a pioneering project aimed at developing the first open parallel corpora and baseline machine translation (MT) systems for four major Indian tribal languages: Bhili, Mundari, Gondi, and Santali. The initiative addresses the invisibility of tribal languages in current AI technologies, which worsens inequalities in education, governance, and digital participation for these communities. AdiBhashaa employs a community-driven approach, involving native speakers directly in the data creation process to ensure authenticity and relevance. Human-in-the-loop validation further enhances the quality and reliability of the language data and MT models. The research includes a systematic evaluation of both encoder-decoder MT models and large language models, aiming to find effective solutions for low-resource language translation. Beyond technical contributions, the project exemplifies a model for more equitable AI research by centering local expertise and empowering early-career researchers from marginalized communities. It emphasizes the critical role of human validation throughout the development of language technologies, promoting inclusivity and capacity building. AdiBhashaa thus sets a precedent for how AI can be developed in ways that respect and uplift underrepresented linguistic communities rather than perpetuating structural inequities. <div>

Abstract: Large language models and multilingual machine translation (MT) systems increasingly drive access to information, yet many languages of the tribal communities remain effectively invisible in these technologies. This invisibility exacerbates existing structural inequities in education, governance, and digital participation. We present AdiBhashaa, a community-driven initiative that constructs the first open parallel corpora and baseline MT systems for four major Indian tribal languages-Bhili, Mundari, Gondi, and Santali. This work combines participatory data creation with native speakers, human-in-the-loop validation, and systematic evaluation of both encoder-decoder MT models and large language models. In addition to reporting technical findings, we articulate how AdiBhashaa illustrates a possible model for more equitable AI research: it centers local expertise, builds capacity among early-career researchers from marginalized communities, and foregrounds human validation in the development of language technologies.

<div> Keywords: Danish, linguistic acceptability, corruption functions, Large Language Models, benchmark  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper presents an enhanced benchmark designed to evaluate linguistic acceptability specifically in Danish. The authors begin by analyzing the most common errors found in written Danish, which informs the creation of fourteen distinct corruption functions. These functions systematically introduce various types of errors into correct Danish sentences to generate incorrect versions. To validate the accuracy and relevance of these corruption functions, the study employs both manual and automatic evaluation methods. The resulting dataset serves as a benchmark for testing Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to judge linguistic acceptability. Compared to existing benchmarks, this new benchmark is broader and more comprehensive, incorporating a wider array of corruption types to better reflect the complexity of linguistic errors. Consequently, this increases the difficulty of the acceptability judgement task, as demonstrated by the lower performance of several LLMs when evaluated on this benchmark. Additionally, the benchmark exhibits a higher discriminatory power, meaning it is more effective at distinguishing between well-performing and poorly performing models. Overall, this work advances the evaluation framework for linguistic acceptability in Danish, providing a more rigorous and nuanced tool for assessing language models. <div>

Abstract: We present an enhanced benchmark for evaluating linguistic acceptability in Danish. We first analyze the most common errors found in written Danish. Based on this analysis, we introduce a set of fourteen corruption functions that generate incorrect sentences by systematically introducing errors into existing correct Danish sentences. To ensure the accuracy of these corruptions, we assess their validity using both manual and automatic methods. The results are then used as a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on a linguistic acceptability judgement task. Our findings demonstrate that this extension is both broader and more comprehensive than the current state of the art. By incorporating a greater variety of corruption types, our benchmark provides a more rigorous assessment of linguistic acceptability, increasing task difficulty, as evidenced by the lower performance of LLMs on our benchmark compared to existing ones. Our results also suggest that our benchmark has a higher discriminatory power which allows to better distinguish well-performing models from low-performing ones.

<div> Keywords: mixed-authorship detection, Info-Mask, adversarial robustness, stylometric features, human-AI collaboration<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of segmenting mixed-authorship texts, identifying precise transition points where authorship shifts between human and AI, a crucial problem for authenticity and trust.  
2. The authors propose a novel framework named Info-Mask that combines stylometric cues, perplexity signals, and structured boundary modeling to effectively detect and segment collaborative human-AI content.

Abstract: In the age of advanced large language models (LLMs), the boundaries between human and AI-generated text are becoming increasingly blurred. We address the challenge of segmenting mixed-authorship text, that is identifying transition points in text where authorship shifts from human to AI or vice-versa, a problem with critical implications for authenticity, trust, and human oversight. We introduce a novel framework, called Info-Mask for mixed authorship detection that integrates stylometric cues, perplexity-driven signals, and structured boundary modeling to accurately segment collaborative human-AI content. To evaluate the robustness of our system against adversarial perturbations, we construct and release an adversarial benchmark dataset Mixed-text Adversarial setting for Segmentation (MAS), designed to probe the limits of existing detectors. Beyond segmentation accuracy, we introduce Human-Interpretable Attribution (HIA overlays that highlight how stylometric features inform boundary predictions, and we conduct a small-scale human study assessing their usefulness. Across multiple architectures, Info-Mask significantly improves span-level robustness under adversarial conditions, establishing new baselines while revealing remaining challenges. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of adversarially robust, interpretable mixed-authorship detection, with implications for trust and oversight in human-AI co-authorship.

<div> Keywords: Source-Shielded Updates, catastrophic forgetting, low-resource adaptation, instruct large language models, parameter importance

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of expanding the linguistic diversity of instruct large language models (LLMs) under low-resource conditions, where only unlabeled target language data is available for adaptation. The authors propose a novel method called Source-Shielded Updates (SSU), which selectively updates model parameters to preserve original source language knowledge, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. SSU utilizes a small subset of source data combined with a parameter importance scoring technique to identify parameters essential for maintaining source task performance. These parameters are then protected via a column-wise freezing strategy during fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on five typologically diverse languages demonstrate that SSU substantially reduces performance degradation on source language tasks—from over 20% down to roughly 3%. At the same time, SSU maintains or even improves performance on target-language tasks compared to full fine-tuning. The study is validated on both 7B and 13B parameter LLMs, with 7B models showing consistent superiority on all benchmarks and 13B models outperforming in most cases. This approach offers a cost-effective and practical solution for adapting instruct LLMs to new languages without requiring labeled data, enhancing global accessibility and multilingual capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Expanding the linguistic diversity of instruct large language models (LLMs) is crucial for global accessibility but is often hindered by the reliance on costly specialized target language labeled data and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. We tackle this challenge under a realistic, low-resource constraint: adapting instruct LLMs using only unlabeled target language data. We introduce Source-Shielded Updates (SSU), a selective parameter update strategy that proactively preserves source knowledge. Using a small set of source data and a parameter importance scoring method, SSU identifies parameters critical to maintaining source abilities. It then applies a column-wise freezing strategy to protect these parameters before adaptation. Experiments across five typologically diverse languages and 7B and 13B models demonstrate that SSU successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting. It reduces performance degradation on monolingual source tasks to just 3.4% (7B) and 2.8% (13B) on average, a stark contrast to the 20.3% and 22.3% from full fine-tuning. SSU also achieves target-language performance highly competitive with full fine-tuning, outperforming it on all benchmarks for 7B models and the majority for 13B models.

<title>SEAL: Self-Evolving Agentic Learning for Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: semantic parsing, knowledge-based QA, self-evolving agentic learning, S-expression, multi-hop reasoning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper addresses key challenges in knowledge-based conversational question answering (KBCQA), such as coreference resolution, contextual dependency modeling, and complex logical reasoning over large knowledge graphs. It identifies limitations in existing methods—both end-to-end semantic parsing and agent-based reasoning—highlighting their structural inaccuracies and high computational costs. To overcome these, the authors propose SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework driven by self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential meaning of input queries. An agentic calibration module then refines this core by fixing syntactic errors and aligning entities and relations accurately with the knowledge graph. The second stage involves template-based completion guided by predicted question types and placeholder instantiation to build executable S-expressions. This decomposition improves logical form generation, structural accuracy, and linking efficiency. A distinctive feature is SEAL’s self-evolving mechanism, which uses local and global memory plus a reflection module to adapt continuously from dialogue history and execution feedback without retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate SEAL’s state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks, proving its robustness, structural fidelity, and computational efficiency. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge-based conversational question answering (KBCQA) confronts persistent challenges in resolving coreference, modeling contextual dependencies, and executing complex logical reasoning. Existing approaches, whether end-to-end semantic parsing or stepwise agent-based reasoning, often suffer from structural inaccuracies and prohibitive computational costs, particularly when processing intricate queries over large knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework grounded in self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model (LLM) extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential semantics of the input query. This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate that SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks. The results validate notable gains in both structural accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the framework's capacity for robust and scalable conversational reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential across diverse language related tasks, yet whether they capture deeper linguistic properties, such as syntactic structure, phonetic cues, and metrical patterns from raw text remains unclear. To analysis whether LLMs can learn these features effectively and apply them to important nature language related tasks, we introduce a novel multilingual genre classification dataset derived from Project Gutenberg, a large-scale digital library offering free access to thousands of public domain literary works, comprising thousands of sentences per binary task (poetry vs. novel;drama vs. poetry;drama vs. novel) in six languages (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese). We augment each with three explicit linguistic feature sets (syntactic tree structures, metaphor counts, and phonetic metrics) to evaluate their impact on classification performance. Experiments demonstrate that although LLM classifiers can learn latent linguistic structures either from raw text or from explicitly provided features, different features contribute unevenly across tasks, which underscores the importance of incorporating more complex linguistic signals during model training.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, agent hierarchies, interactive environments, simulation-reality gap, policy learning<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) transitioning from passive responders to autonomous agents, emphasizing a shift from imitation learning to incentive-driven decision making. A primary challenge in this transition is the lack of scalable infrastructure to generate high-quality interaction signals for effective policy learning. To overcome this, the authors propose a comprehensive method that scales the diversity and complexity of interactive environments along three key dimensions: (1) Complexity, through NexAU, a flexible agent framework that enables the construction of complex agent hierarchies with simple configurations; (2) Diversity, via NexA4A, which automatically produces diverse agent hierarchies from natural language inputs, thereby covering infinite potential domains; and (3) Fidelity, using NexGAP to bridge the gap between simulation and reality by integrating dynamic real-world environments to create grounded trajectory synthesis. The researchers train the Nex-N1 model within these enriched environments, demonstrating its superior performance on benchmarks such as SWE-bench and tau2 when compared to state-of-the-art open-source models and competitive standing against leading proprietary models on challenging agent-focused tasks. The work contributes to the research community by open-sourcing the Nex ecosystem and the corresponding model weights, fostering further development in autonomous agent learning. <div>

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive responders to autonomous agents necessitates a fundamental shift in learning paradigms -- from static imitation to incentive-driven decision making. However, this transition is significantly impeded by the lack of scalable infrastructure capable of constructing high-quality interaction signals for effective policy learning. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive method designed to systematically scale the diversity and complexity of interactive environments. Our method realizes this scaling by addressing three orthogonal dimensions: (1) Complexity: NexAU, a flexible agent framework that supports building complex agent hierarchies via simple configurations; (2) Diversity: NexA4A automatically generates diverse agent hierarchies from natural language to cover infinite domains; and (3) Fidelity: NexGAP bridges the simulation-reality gap by integrating dynamic real-world environment for grounded trajectories synthesis. We train Nex-N1 upon the diverse and complex interactive environments established by our infrastructure. Empirical results on benchmarks such as SWE-bench and tau2 demonstrate that Nex-N1 consistently outperforms SOTA open-source models and achieves competitive performance against frontier proprietary models on complex agentic tasks. We open-source the Nex ecosystem and model weights to facilitate further research.

<div> Keywords: Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking, contrastive learning, token-level attribution, factual evidence, retrieval accuracy<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER), a novel method aimed at restructuring information retrieval around factual evidence by fine-tuning embeddings through contrastive learning. CER generates token-level attribution rationales for each retrieved passage, enabling transparent explanations of the retrieval process. A key innovation of the approach involves automatically selecting hard negatives based on a subjectivity criterion, which compels the model to cluster factual rationales closer in the embedding space while pushing subjective or misleading explanations further apart. This mechanism explicitly aligns the embedding space with evidential reasoning, enhancing the reliability of retrieval results. The authors evaluated CER on clinical trial reports, an important safety-critical domain, where accurate and trustworthy retrieval is essential. Experimental results demonstrated that CER improves retrieval accuracy compared to traditional methods and effectively mitigates hallucination issues commonly seen in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Moreover, the approach offers interpretable, evidence-based retrieval outputs, increasing user trust and supporting transparent decision-making processes. Overall, CER represents a significant advancement in embedding learning and evidence-grounded retrieval, with promising applications in high-stakes environments demanding reliable information access. <div>

<div> Keywords: Speculative Decoding, Arbitrage, Large Language Models, Step-level Verification, Inference Efficiency

<br /><br />Summary: Modern large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities through long Chain of Thoughts but suffer from high computational costs during inference. Speculative Decoding aims to speed up inference by using a fast, less accurate draft model to propose tokens that a more capable target model then verifies in parallel. Traditional token-level Speculative Decoding, however, faces inefficiencies due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches even when steps are semantically equivalent. Recent advances have adopted step-level semantic verification to accept or reject entire reasoning steps at once, somewhat improving efficiency. Despite this, current step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps, resulting in wasted computation on the target model side. To overcome this, the paper introduces Arbitrage, a new step-level speculative generation framework that dynamically routes generation based on the relative advantages of the draft and target models. Unlike fixed acceptance thresholds, Arbitrage employs a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model would produce a significantly better reasoning step. This approach approximates an ideal Oracle that selects higher-quality steps, achieving near-optimal trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. The proposed method consistently outperforms existing step-level Speculative Decoding baselines on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, reducing inference latency by up to approximately 2× without sacrificing accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models achieve impressive reasoning capabilities with long Chain of Thoughts, but they incur substantial computational cost during inference, and this motivates techniques to improve the performance-cost ratio. Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\sim2\times$ at matched accuracy.

<div> Keywords: Format Reinforcement Learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, TreeSim, Node-chrF, StrucAUC  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of translating structured text at the document level, particularly handling complex XML or HTML structures, which previous works struggle with beyond sentence-level translation. To overcome this, the authors propose Format Reinforcement Learning (FormatRL), a method that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization with a supervised fine-tuning model to directly optimize for structure-aware rewards. Two novel reward functions are introduced: TreeSim, a metric that measures the structural similarity between the predicted and reference XML trees, and Node-chrF, which evaluates translation quality at the granularity of XML nodes. Furthermore, they apply StrucAUC, a fine-grained evaluation metric that differentiates between minor structural errors and major failures, providing a more detailed assessment of the model's performance. Experiments conducted on the SAP software-documentation benchmark demonstrate that FormatRL achieves improvements across six different evaluation metrics, indicating enhancements in both structural integrity and translation quality. The study also includes an analysis highlighting how the different reward functions individually contribute to the observed improvements, validating the effectiveness of incorporating structure-aware objectives in document-level structured text translation. <div>

Additionally, we apply StrucAUC, a fine-grained metric distinguishing between minor errors and major structural failures. Experiments on the SAP software-documentation benchmark demonstrate improvements across six metrics and an analysis further shows how different reward functions contribute to improvements in both structural and translation quality.

<div> Keywords: Semantic Soft Bootstrapping, long context reasoning, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, self-distillation, large language models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenges of training large language models (LLMs) for long context reasoning tasks, particularly math and programming problems, where reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is commonly used. RLVR suffers from limitations such as sparse rewards and poor sample efficiency, resulting in high computational costs during post-training. To overcome these issues, the authors propose Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB), a self-distillation technique where the same base model acts both as teacher and student but is exposed to different semantic contexts about answer correctness during training. The method involves prompting the model with math problems, generating multiple rollouts, filtering correct and frequent incorrect responses, and then guiding the model to produce robust step-by-step explanations with verified answers. This process automatically generates paired training data without human supervision. The student model uses only the original question and tries to match the teacher’s sequence of logits during training. Experiments with the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model fine-tuned on GSM8K show significant accuracy improvements of 10.6% and 10% on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks, respectively, outperforming the traditional group relative policy optimization (GRPO) RLVR method. The code and model resources are publicly available for further research. <div>

Abstract: Long context reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated enhancement of their cognitive capabilities via chain-of-thought (CoT) inference. Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show a jump of 10.6%, and 10% improvements in accuracy, respectively, over group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which is a commonly used RLVR algorithm. Our code is available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/semantic-soft-bootstrapping, and the model, curated dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/semantic-soft-bootstrapping.

Abstract: Effective communication is central to achieving positive healthcare outcomes in mental health contexts, yet international students often face linguistic and cultural barriers that hinder their communication of mental distress. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI-generated images in supporting self-expression of mental distress. To achieve this, twenty Chinese international students studying at UK universities were invited to describe their personal experiences of mental distress. These descriptions were elaborated using GPT-4o with four persona-based prompt templates rooted in contemporary counselling practice to generate corresponding images. Participants then evaluated the helpfulness of generated images in facilitating the expression of their feelings based on their original descriptions. The resulting dataset comprises 100 textual descriptions of mental distress, 400 generated images, and corresponding human evaluation scores. Findings indicate that prompt design substantially affects perceived helpfulness, with the illustrator persona achieving the highest ratings. This work introduces the first publicly available text-to-image evaluation dataset with human judgment scores in the mental health domain, offering valuable resources for image evaluation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and multi-modal research on mental health communication.

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates few-shot prompting as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks, focusing on code vulnerability detection. It emphasizes the importance of selecting high-quality in-context examples to improve performance, especially in complex domains like security. The study evaluates three methods using the Gemini-1.5-Flash model: standard few-shot prompting with random examples, retrieval-augmented prompting with semantically similar examples, and retrieval-based labeling without model inference. Results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented prompting consistently outperforms the other two, achieving an F1 score of 74.05% and partial match accuracy of 83.90% at 20-shot settings. This approach also surpasses zero-shot prompting and fine-tuned Gemini-1.5-Flash models, which scored significantly lower, while avoiding the additional cost and time of fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning CodeBERT delivers the highest performance (F1 score of 91.22%, partial match accuracy of 91.30%) but requires greater training effort and resource investment. Overall, retrieval-augmented prompting presents a practical balance between effectiveness and efficiency for vulnerability detection without the overhead of full model fine-tuning. <div>

Abstract: Few-shot prompting has emerged as a practical alternative to fine-tuning for leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in specialized tasks. However, its effectiveness depends heavily on the selection and quality of in-context examples, particularly in complex domains. In this work, we examine retrieval-augmented prompting as a strategy to improve few-shot performance in code vulnerability detection, where the goal is to identify one or more security-relevant weaknesses present in a given code snippet from a predefined set of vulnerability categories. We perform a systematic evaluation using the Gemini-1.5-Flash model across three approaches: (1) standard few-shot prompting with randomly selected examples, (2) retrieval-augmented prompting using semantically similar examples, and (3) retrieval-based labeling, which assigns labels based on retrieved examples without model inference. Our results show that retrieval-augmented prompting consistently outperforms the other prompting strategies. At 20 shots, it achieves an F1 score of 74.05% and a partial match accuracy of 83.90%. We further compare this approach against zero-shot prompting and several fine-tuned models, including Gemini-1.5-Flash and smaller open-source models such as DistilBERT, DistilGPT2, and CodeBERT. Retrieval-augmented prompting outperforms both zero-shot (F1 score: 36.35%, partial match accuracy: 20.30%) and fine-tuned Gemini (F1 score: 59.31%, partial match accuracy: 53.10%), while avoiding the training time and cost associated with model fine-tuning. On the other hand, fine-tuning CodeBERT yields higher performance (F1 score: 91.22%, partial match accuracy: 91.30%) but requires additional training, maintenance effort, and resources.

<title>Towards Contextual Sensitive Data Detection</title>

<div> Keywords: sensitive data detection, contextualization, large language models, data privacy, humanitarian datasets<br /><br />Summary:  
1) The paper addresses the challenge of protecting sensitive data in open data portals by proposing more refined, context-aware methods beyond traditional personal data privacy tools.  
2) It introduces two novel mechanisms for contextual sensitive data detection: type contextualization and domain contextualization. Type contextualization identifies the semantic type of data values and evaluates their sensitivity relative to the dataset context. Domain contextualization assesses sensitivity by retrieving relevant sensitivity rules from external documents considering attributes like data topic and geographic origin.  
3) Experiments leveraging large language models (LLMs) show that type contextualization significantly improves detection accuracy, achieving 94% recall and reducing false positives compared to 63% recall with commercial tools.  
4) Domain contextualization proves effective in detecting sensitive data in non-standard domains, particularly humanitarian datasets, by grounding sensitivity judgments within broader regulatory and thematic contexts.  
5) Evaluation with humanitarian data experts highlights that explanations generated by context-grounded LLMs enhance manual auditing consistency and provide valuable guidance. The authors also release open-source tools and annotated datasets to facilitate further research and application in contextual sensitive data detection. <div>

Abstract: The emergence of open data portals necessitates more attention to protecting sensitive data before datasets get published and exchanged. While an abundance of methods for suppressing sensitive data exist, the conceptualization of sensitive data and methods to detect it, focus particularly on personal data that, if disclosed, may be harmful or violate privacy. We observe the need for refining and broadening our definitions of sensitive data, and argue that the sensitivity of data depends on its context. Based on this definition, we introduce two mechanisms for contextual sensitive data detection that con- sider the broader context of a dataset at hand. First, we introduce type contextualization, which first detects the semantic type of particular data values, then considers the overall context of the data values within the dataset or document. Second, we introduce domain contextualization which determines sensitivity of a given dataset in the broader context based on the retrieval of relevant rules from documents that specify data sensitivity (e.g., data topic and geographic origin). Experiments with these mechanisms, assisted by large language models (LLMs), confirm that: 1) type-contextualization significantly reduces the number of false positives for type-based sensitive data detection and reaches a recall of 94% compared to 63% with commercial tools, and 2) domain-contextualization leveraging sensitivity rule retrieval is effective for context-grounded sensitive data detection in non-standard data domains such as humanitarian datasets. Evaluation with humanitarian data experts also reveals that context-grounded LLM explanations provide useful guidance in manual data auditing processes, improving consistency. We open-source mechanisms and annotated datasets for contextual sensitive data detection at https://github.com/trl-lab/sensitive-data-detection.

<title>Can machines perform a qualitative data analysis? Reading the debate with Alan Turing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Large Language Models, qualitative data analysis, Alan Turing, empirical investigation, machine intelligence<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper critically examines the ongoing debate surrounding the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in qualitative data analysis, challenging the predominant skepticism found in existing literature. It argues that focusing on the methodological validity of LLMs for qualitative analysis misses the key issue, which should instead be the empirical study of how artificial systems perform such analyses. Drawing inspiration from Alan Turing’s seminal work "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," the paper reframes the central question: rather than asking if machines can perform qualitative analysis in principle, we should assess whether analyses produced by LLMs are sufficiently comparable to those conducted by human analysts. The author provides empirical evidence supporting this perspective, suggesting that LLMs can offer meaningful and relevant interpretations of qualitative data. In conclusion, the paper employs Turing’s rhetorical style to engage with and deconstruct common counterarguments against using LLMs for qualitative analysis. By doing so, it broadens the conversation to focus on the practical and comparative outcomes of LLM-assisted qualitative research, advocating for a shift in critical discourse from theoretical objections to empirical evaluations of machine-generated analyses. <div>

Abstract: This paper reflects on the literature that rejects the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in qualitative data analysis. It illustrates through empirical evidence as well as critical reflections why the current critical debate is focusing on the wrong problems. The paper proposes that the focus of researching the use of the LLMs for qualitative analysis is not the method per se, but rather the empirical investigation of an artificial system performing an analysis. The paper builds on the seminal work of Alan Turing and reads the current debate using key ideas from Turing "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". This paper therefore reframes the debate on qualitative analysis with LLMs and states that rather than asking whether machines can perform qualitative analysis in principle, we should ask whether with LLMs we can produce analyses that are sufficiently comparable to human analysts. In the final part the contrary views to performing qualitative analysis with LLMs are analysed using the same writing and rhetorical style that Turing used in his seminal work, to discuss the contrary views to the main question.

<div> Keywords: Network of Theseus, inductive bias, architecture conversion, representational similarity, efficiency tradeoffs<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper challenges the conventional assumption in deep learning that the neural network architecture used for training must remain the same during inference, which limits architecture design choices due to optimization difficulties.<br />2. It introduces Network of Theseus (NoT), a novel method that progressively transforms a guide network architecture into a different target architecture part-by-part, while maintaining the original network’s performance.<br />3. NoT performs incremental replacement of components in the guide network with modules from the target architecture, using representational similarity metrics to align and preserve functionality.<br />4. This method allows for substantial architectural changes, such as converting convolutional networks into multilayer perceptrons or transforming GPT-2 models into recurrent neural networks.<br />5. By separating the optimization phase from the deployment architecture, NoT broadens the range of feasible inference-time architectures, enabling improved accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs and facilitating more targeted exploration of network design. <div>
arXiv:2512.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A standard assumption in deep learning is that the inductive bias introduced by a neural network architecture must persist from training through inference. The architecture you train with is the architecture you deploy. This assumption constrains the community from selecting architectures that may have desirable efficiency or design properties due to difficulties with optimization. We challenge this assumption with Network of Theseus (NoT), a method for progressively converting a trained, or even untrained, guide network architecture part-by-part into an entirely different target network architecture while preserving the performance of the guide network. At each stage, components in the guide network architecture are incrementally replaced with target architecture modules and aligned via representational similarity metrics. This procedure largely preserves the functionality of the guide network even under substantial architectural changes-for example, converting a convolutional network into a multilayer perceptron, or GPT-2 into a recurrent neural network. By decoupling optimization from deployment, NoT expands the space of viable inference-time architectures, opening opportunities for better accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs and enabling more directed exploration of the architectural design space.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, healthcare, safety alignment, conversational medical assistants, adversarial robustness<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare by focusing on improving their safety and trustworthiness. It introduces an iterative post-deployment alignment framework that leverages Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance model performance specifically against domain safety concerns. The study evaluates four different LLMs—Llama-3B, Llama-8B, Meditron-8B, and Mistral-7B—using the CARES-18K benchmark which tests adversarial robustness to harmful queries. Results demonstrate up to a 42% improvement in detecting unsafe or harmful queries, though the improvements come with trade-offs such as increased erroneous refusals of benign queries, revealing biases inherent to model architectures. The authors conduct ablation studies to determine when self-evaluation by models is sufficient and when external or finetuned evaluators are necessary for reliable assessments. Ultimately, the research emphasizes the critical need to balance safety, user trust, and clinical usefulness when designing conversational medical assistants, advocating for best practices in alignment and evaluation to ensure these tools are both effective and safe in medical contexts. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in healthcare, yet ensuring their safety and trustworthiness remains a barrier to deployment. Conversational medical assistants must avoid unsafe compliance without over-refusing benign queries. We present an iterative post-deployment alignment framework that applies Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine models against domain-specific safety signals. Using the CARES-18K benchmark for adversarial robustness, we evaluate four LLMs (Llama-3B/8B, Meditron-8B, Mistral-7B) across multiple cycles. Our results show up to 42% improvement in safety-related metrics for harmful query detection, alongside interesting trade-offs against erroneous refusals, thereby exposing architecture-dependent calibration biases. We also perform ablation studies to identify when self-evaluation is reliable and when external or finetuned judges are necessary to maximize performance gains. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting best practices that balance patient safety, user trust, and clinical utility in the design of conversational medical assistants.

<div> Keywords: image captioning, text-only training, modality gap reduction, CLIP representation, retrieval augmentation<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of generating image captions without relying on human-annotated image-text pairs for training, a task that remains difficult compared to fully supervised approaches. The authors propose TOMCap, a novel text-only training framework that bypasses the need for aligned image-caption data by leveraging a pre-trained language model decoder prompted with information derived from CLIP image representations. A core innovation of the approach is the reduction of the modality gap between image and text representations to make the prompting effective. Furthermore, TOMCap incorporates retrieval of relevant example captions alongside latent vector representations to augment and better guide the caption generation process. The method was evaluated through extensive experiments that demonstrate it outperforms existing training-free and text-only image captioning techniques. Finally, the study includes an analysis of the impact of various configurations of the retrieval-augmentation mechanism and the modality gap reduction process, shedding light on their contributions to overall performance. This work presents a promising direction toward reducing dependency on costly curated datasets while maintaining competitive captioning quality. <div>

Abstract: Image captioning has drawn considerable attention from the natural language processing and computer vision fields. Aiming to reduce the reliance on curated data, several studies have explored image captioning without any humanly-annotated image-text pairs for training, although existing methods are still outperformed by fully supervised approaches. This paper proposes TOMCap, i.e., an improved text-only training method that performs captioning without the need for aligned image-caption pairs. The method is based on prompting a pre-trained language model decoder with information derived from a CLIP representation, after undergoing a process to reduce the modality gap. We specifically tested the combined use of retrieved examples of captions, and latent vector representations, to guide the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we show that TOMCap outperforms other training-free and text-only methods. We also analyze the impact of different choices regarding the configuration of the retrieval-augmentation and modality gap reduction components.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal LLMs, video captioning, hallucination, contrastive alignment, action faithfulness

<br /><br />Summary: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has enabled impressive capabilities in generating descriptive captions for videos. However, these models face significant challenges due to factual inaccuracies known as hallucinations, particularly involving incorrect objects and actions described in the generated captions. Previous methods have mainly focused on reducing hallucinations in static images, but addressing both visual object and temporal action hallucinations in dynamic videos remains unresolved. To address this, the authors propose the Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework. SANTA enhances object and action faithfulness by removing spurious correlations and emphasizing accurate visual facts. The framework introduces a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme that identifies potential hallucinations within the model and converts original captions into contrasted negative samples for training. Additionally, a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment mechanism is developed to align detected objects and relation-based actions with their corresponding visual regions and temporal phrases in the video. Extensive experimental results show that SANTA outperforms existing techniques in mitigating hallucinations related to both objects and actions, achieving superior accuracy on dedicated hallucination examination benchmarks. This advances the reliability and factual consistency of video captioning by MLLMs. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancement in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) has demonstrated their remarkable capability to generate descriptive captions for input videos. However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SANTA outperforms existing methods in alleviating object and action hallucinations, yielding superior performance on the hallucination examination benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Actor-Critic, Natural Language, Off-Policy Training, Sparse Rewards<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of training large language model (LLM) agents that interact dynamically with environments over long horizons, especially when expert demonstrations are unavailable. Traditional policy gradient methods struggle due to sparse rewards and the complexity of exploration in natural language action spaces, resulting in unstable and sample-inefficient training. The authors propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), an innovative algorithm where the critic, also an LLM, generates natural language explanations instead of scalar values. These explanations provide richer, more actionable feedback that helps the policy understand and improve suboptimal actions without relying solely on random exploration. NLAC can be trained off-policy and does not require policy gradients, enhancing data efficiency and training stability. The approach is demonstrated across various tasks including reasoning, web browsing, tool use, and dialogue, showing that NLAC outperforms existing methods. Overall, NLAC offers a promising, scalable, and stable framework for training LLM agents in environments with large and open-ended natural language action spaces and sparse reward signals. <div>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents -- LLMs that dynamically interact with an environment over long horizons -- have become an increasingly important area of research, enabling automation in complex tasks involving tool-use, web browsing, and dialogue with people. In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents.

<div> Keywords: speech rhythm, articulatory movements, cortical oscillations, limit cycle, motor activity<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The study investigates whether rhythmic patterns observed in the acoustic and neuronal oscillations associated with human speech are also present in the articulatory movements that produce speech sounds.<br />2. Traditional views consider speech movements as discrete and goal-oriented, which do not easily explain the observed rhythmicity in speech-related neural activity.<br />3. The authors introduce an alternative representation of discrete speech movements, demonstrating that these can be organized as limit cycles, a concept from dynamical systems characterizing stable, repeating patterns.<br />4. This novel framework reveals rhythmic structures in motor activity underlying speech that were previously undetectable, linking biological rhythmicity directly with the fundamental articulation process.<br />5. The findings help reconcile the longstanding paradox between the discrete nature of speech actions and the pervasive presence of rhythmicity in biological systems, suggesting speech articulation itself possesses inherent rhythmic organization at the level of individual movements. <div>
arXiv:2512.04642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhythmic fluctuations in acoustic energy and accompanying neuronal excitations in cortical oscillations are characteristic of human speech, yet whether a corresponding rhythmicity inheres in the articulatory movements that generate speech remains unclear. The received understanding of speech movements as discrete, goal-oriented actions struggles to make contact with the rhythmicity findings. In this work, we demonstrate that an unintuitive -- but no less principled than the conventional -- representation for discrete movements reveals a pervasive limit cycle organization and unlocks the recovery of previously inaccessible rhythmic structure underlying the motor activity of speech. These results help resolve a time-honored tension between the ubiquity of biological rhythmicity and discreteness in speech, the quintessential human higher function, by revealing a rhythmic organization at the most fundamental level of individual articulatory actions.

<div> Video Large Language Models, temporal reasoning, hallucination mitigation, contrastive decoding, video understanding<br /><br />Summary:  
Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have made significant advancements in understanding video content but face challenges in accurately capturing temporal information, often resulting in temporally inconsistent or causally implausible descriptions. This leads to significant hallucination issues which prior research has not sufficiently addressed, primarily focusing instead on spatial hallucinations such as object mismatches. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel method called Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), which is training-free and dynamically assesses each output token's likelihood of hallucination. SEASON enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness by applying adaptive contrastive decoding that contrasts tokens against their respective temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments reveal that SEASON surpasses all previous training-free hallucination mitigation techniques on three benchmarks specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations. Furthermore, SEASON also improves performance across four general video understanding benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and broad applicability. The approach offers a practical solution to enhance the reliability and coherence of VideoLLM outputs without additional training requirements, and the authors plan to release the code upon acceptance of the work. <div>

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in video understanding. However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance.

<title>Topology Matters: Measuring Memory Leakage in Multi-Agent LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: multi-agent systems, memory leakage, graph topology, privacy risk, LLMs<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The article introduces MAMA (Multi-Agent Memory Attack), a novel framework designed to quantify how different graph topologies affect memory leakage in multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems. MAMA uses synthetic documents embedded with labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to create sanitized task instructions. The protocol consists of two phases: Engram, where private information is seeded into a target agent's memory, and Resonance, involving multiple rounds of attacker interaction to extract that information. Leakage is measured as the proportion of ground-truth PII successfully recovered across up to 10 interaction rounds. The study systematically evaluates six common network topologies—fully connected, ring, chain, binary tree, star, and star-ring—while varying the number of agents (4 to 6), attacker-target placements, and base LLM models. Results show that fully connected graphs lead to the highest leakage, chains offer the strongest protection, and leakage is higher when the attacker is closer to the target or the target has higher network centrality. Leakage escalates rapidly in early rounds before stabilizing. Although absolute leakage rates differ by model choice, the ranking of topologies remains consistent. Temporally or spatially sensitive PII is more vulnerable than identity or regulated credentials. The work offers practical recommendations including favoring sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximizing attacker-target distances, limiting node degrees and network radius, avoiding shortcut connections bypassing central hubs, and deploying topology-aware access controls to mitigate privacy risks in multi-agent LLM systems. <div>

Abstract: Graph topology is a fundamental determinant of memory leakage in multi-agent LLM systems, yet its effects remain poorly quantified. We introduce MAMA (Multi-Agent Memory Attack), a framework that measures how network structure shapes leakage. MAMA operates on synthetic documents containing labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities, from which we generate sanitized task instructions. We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over up to 10 interaction rounds, we quantify leakage as the fraction of ground-truth PII recovered from attacking agent outputs via exact matching. We systematically evaluate six common network topologies (fully connected, ring, chain, binary tree, star, and star-ring), varying agent counts $n\in\{4,5,6\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Our findings reveal consistent patterns: fully connected graphs exhibit maximum leakage while chains provide strongest protection; shorter attacker-target graph distance and higher target centrality significantly increase vulnerability; leakage rises sharply in early rounds before plateauing; model choice shifts absolute leakage rates but preserves topology rankings; temporal/locational PII attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers. These results provide the first systematic mapping from architectural choices to measurable privacy risk, yielding actionable guidance: prefer sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximize attacker-target separation, limit node degree and network radius, avoid shortcuts bypassing hubs, and implement topology-aware access controls.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, multi-agent systems, ethical behavior, mechanistic interpretability, alignment techniques  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This position paper addresses the ethical challenges posed by multi-agent systems of large language models (MALMs) that interact autonomously. First, it emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to assess ethical behavior not only at the individual agent level but also in their interactions and the system as a whole. Second, it highlights the importance of mechanistic interpretability to understand the internal mechanisms behind emergent behaviors arising in MALMs, providing transparency and insight into their decision-making processes. Third, the paper proposes developing parameter-efficient alignment methods that can effectively guide MALMs towards ethical conduct without degrading their overall performance or capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in various applications, often functioning as autonomous agents that interact with each other in multi-agent systems. While these systems have shown promise in enhancing capabilities and enabling complex tasks, they also pose significant ethical challenges. This position paper outlines a research agenda aimed at ensuring the ethical behavior of multi-agent systems of LLMs (MALMs) from the perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We identify three key research challenges: (i) developing comprehensive evaluation frameworks to assess ethical behavior at individual, interactional, and systemic levels; (ii) elucidating the internal mechanisms that give rise to emergent behaviors through mechanistic interpretability; and (iii) implementing targeted parameter-efficient alignment techniques to steer MALMs towards ethical behaviors without compromising their performance.

<div> Memory-augmented models, Small Language Models, MemLoRA, Vision-Language Models, Multimodal understanding<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of deploying memory-augmented language models on local devices, where large language models (LLMs) are typically too resource-intensive. To overcome this, the authors propose MemLoRA, a memory system that equips Small Language Models (SLMs) with specialized memory adapters to perform key memory operations such as knowledge extraction, update, and memory-augmented generation. This enables efficient and privacy-preserving on-device memory operations without cloud dependence. MemLoRA significantly outperforms much larger baseline models on text-only benchmarks like LoCoMo, achieving performance comparable to models that are up to 60 times larger. To extend capabilities to multimodal tasks, the authors introduce MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) into the memory system. This integration enables strong native visual understanding and reasoning, demonstrated through a Visual Question Answering extension of LoCoMo where MemLoRA-V achieves an accuracy of 81.3%, drastically surpassing caption-based approaches. Overall, the approach provides an effective solution for local deployment of memory-augmented systems with strong performance in both text-only and multimodal contexts while maintaining user privacy and minimizing computational cost. <div>

Abstract: Memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable consistency during prolonged dialogues by storing relevant memories and incorporating them as context. Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private. However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment. Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance. Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding. Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation. Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency. On text-only operations, MemLoRA outperforms 10$\times$ larger baseline models (e.g., Gemma2-27B) and achieves performance comparable to 60$\times$ larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B) on the LoCoMo benchmark. To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning. On this, our VLM-integrated MemLoRA-V shows massive improvements over caption-based approaches (81.3 vs. 23.7 accuracy) while keeping strong performance in text-based tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our method in multimodal contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a key topic in AI and NLP, transforming sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and marketing by improving customer service, automating tasks, providing insights, improving diagnostics, and personalizing learning experiences. Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time. Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations.

<title>STELLA: Guiding Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting with Semantic Abstractions</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, time series forecasting, semantic abstraction, hierarchical semantic anchors, STELLA  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Recent efforts to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting have underperformed due to their reliance on static correlations and inadequate use of the models' reasoning strengths. To overcome these issues, the authors introduce STELLA (Semantic-Temporal Alignment with Language Abstractions), a novel framework that enhances LLM forecasting by systematically mining and injecting structured supplementary information. STELLA achieves this through a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decomposes input time series into three components: trend, seasonality, and residuals. These components’ behavioral features are then translated into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors consisting of two parts: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP), providing global context, and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for capturing instance-specific dynamics. These anchors serve as prefix-prompts that guide LLMs to better model the intrinsic temporal dynamics of the data. The effectiveness of STELLA is validated through experiments on eight benchmark datasets, where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both long- and short-term forecasting tasks. Furthermore, STELLA demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of the dynamically generated semantic anchors in improving forecasting accuracy and model performance. <div>

Abstract: Recent adaptations of Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting often fail to effectively enhance information for raw series, leaving LLM reasoning capabilities underutilized. Existing prompting strategies rely on static correlations rather than generative interpretations of dynamic behavior, lacking critical global and instance-specific context. To address this, we propose STELLA (Semantic-Temporal Alignment with Language Abstractions), a framework that systematically mines and injects structured supplementary and complementary information. STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our dynamically generated semantic anchors.

Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Consumer Index (ACE), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform high-value consumer tasks. ACE contains a hidden heldout set of 400 test cases, split across four consumer activities: shopping, food, gaming, and DIY. We are also open sourcing 80 cases as a devset with a CC-BY license. For the ACE leaderboard we evaluated 10 frontier models (with websearch turned on) using a novel grading methodology that dynamically checks whether relevant parts of the response are grounded in the retrieved web sources. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) is the top-performing model, scoring 56.1%, followed by o3 Pro (Thinking = On) (55.2%) and GPT 5.1 (Thinking = High) (55.1%). Models differ across domains, and in Shopping the top model scores under 50%. For some requests (such as giving the correct price or providing working links), models are highly prone to hallucination. Overall, ACE shows a substantial gap between the performance of even the best models and consumers' AI needs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be highly effective for solving complex reasoning tasks. Surprisingly, their capabilities can often be improved by iterating on previously generated solutions. In this context, a reasoning plan for generating and combining a set of solutions can be thought of as an algorithm for reasoning using a probabilistic oracle.
  We introduce a theoretical framework for analyzing such reasoning algorithms. This framework formalizes the principles underlying popular techniques for iterative improvement and answer aggregation, providing a foundation for designing a new generation of more powerful reasoning methods. Unlike approaches for understanding models that rely on architectural specifics, our model is grounded in experimental evidence. As a result, it offers a general perspective that may extend to a wide range of current and future reasoning oracles.

Abstract: Agents capable of accomplishing complex tasks through multiple interactions with the environment have emerged as a popular research direction. However, in such multi-step settings, the conventional group-level policy optimization algorithm becomes suboptimal because of its underlying assumption that each action holds equal contribution, which deviates significantly from reality. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of actions are critical in determining the final outcome. Building on this insight, we propose CARL, a critical-action-focused reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for multi-step agents. CARL achieves focused training through providing action-level optimization signals for high-criticality actions while excluding low-criticality actions from model update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARL achieves both stronger performance and higher efficiency during training and inference across diverse evaluation settings.

Abstract: As healthcare increasingly turns to AI for scalable and trustworthy clinical decision support, ensuring reliability in model reasoning remains a critical challenge. Individual large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations and inconsistency, whereas naive ensembles of models often fail to deliver stable and credible recommendations. Building on our previous work on LLM Chemistry, which quantifies the collaborative compatibility among LLMs, we apply this framework to improve the reliability in medication recommendation from brief clinical vignettes. Our approach leverages multi-LLM collaboration guided by Chemistry-inspired interaction modeling, enabling ensembles that are effective (exploiting complementary strengths), stable (producing consistent quality), and calibrated (minimizing interference and error amplification). We evaluate our Chemistry-based Multi-LLM collaboration strategy on real-world clinical scenarios to investigate whether such interaction-aware ensembles can generate credible, patient-specific medication recommendations. Preliminary results are encouraging, suggesting that LLM Chemistry-guided collaboration may offer a promising path toward reliable and trustworthy AI assistants in clinical practice.

<title>DraCo: Draft as CoT for Text-to-Image Preview and Rare Concept Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for enhanced text-to-image generation. However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce EMMA-500, a large-scale multilingual language model continue-trained on texts across 546 languages designed for enhanced multilingual performance, focusing on improving language coverage for low-resource languages. To facilitate continual pre-training, we compile the MaLA corpus, a comprehensive multilingual dataset enriched with curated datasets across diverse domains. Leveraging this corpus, we conduct extensive continual pre-training of the Llama 2 7B model, resulting in EMMA-500, which demonstrates robust performance across a wide collection of benchmarks, including a comprehensive set of multilingual tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of continual pre-training in expanding large language models' language capacity, particularly for underrepresented languages, demonstrating significant gains in cross-lingual transfer, task generalization, and language adaptability. We release the MaLA corpus, EMMA-500 model weights, scripts, and model generations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating natural language answers, yet their outputs often remain unverifiable and difficult to trace. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a complementary strength by representing entities and their relationships in structured form, providing a foundation for more reliable reasoning. We propose a novel framework that integrates LLM reasoning with KGs by linking each step of the reasoning process to graph-structured data. This grounding turns intermediate ``thoughts'' into interpretable traces that remain consistent with external knowledge. Our approach incorporates multiple reasoning strategies, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT), and is evaluated on GRBench, a benchmark for domain-specific graph reasoning. Our experiments show state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with at least 26.5\% improvement over CoT baselines. Beyond accuracy, we analyze how step depth, branching structure, and model size influence reasoning quality, offering insights into the conditions that support effective reasoning. Together, these contributions highlight how grounding LLMs in structured knowledge enables both higher accuracy and greater interpretability in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with hierarchical instruction schemes, where certain instructions (e.g., system-level directives) are expected to take precedence over others (e.g., user messages). Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of how effectively these hierarchical control mechanisms work. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework based on constraint prioritization to assess how well LLMs enforce instruction hierarchies. Our experiments across six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that models struggle with consistent instruction prioritization, even for simple formatting conflicts. We find that the widely-adopted system/user prompt separation fails to establish a reliable instruction hierarchy, and models exhibit strong inherent biases toward certain constraint types regardless of their priority designation. Interestingly, we also find that societal hierarchy framings (e.g., authority, expertise, consensus) show stronger influence on model behavior than system/user roles, suggesting that pretraining-derived social structures function as latent behavioral priors with potentially greater impact than post-training guardrails.

Abstract: This study examines ChatGPT-4's capability to replicate linguistic strategies used in political discourse, focusing on its potential for manipulative language generation. As large language models become increasingly popular for text generation, concerns have grown regarding their role in spreading fake news and propaganda. This research compares real political speeches with those generated by ChatGPT, emphasizing presuppositions (a rhetorical device that subtly influences audiences by packaging some content as already known at the moment of utterance, thus swaying opinions without explicit argumentation). Using a corpus-based pragmatic analysis, this study assesses how well ChatGPT can mimic these persuasive strategies. The findings reveal that although ChatGPT-generated texts contain many manipulative presuppositions, key differences emerge in their frequency, form, and function compared with those of politicians. For instance, ChatGPT often relies on change-of-state verbs used in fixed phrases, whereas politicians use presupposition triggers in more varied and creative ways. Such differences, however, are challenging to detect with the naked eye, underscoring the potential risks posed by large language models in political and public discourse.Using a corpus-based pragmatic analysis, this study assesses how well ChatGPT can mimic these persuasive strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their capability in performing NLP tasks. However, deeper semantic understanding, contextual coherence, and more subtle reasoning are still difficult to obtain. The paper discusses state-of-the-art methodologies that advance LLMs with more advanced NLU techniques, such as semantic parsing, knowledge integration, and contextual reinforcement learning. We analyze the use of structured knowledge graphs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning strategies that match models with human-level understanding. Furthermore, we address the incorporation of transformer-based architectures, contrastive learning, and hybrid symbolic-neural methods that address problems like hallucinations, ambiguity, and inconsistency in the factual perspectives involved in performing complex NLP tasks, such as question-answering text summarization and dialogue generation. Our findings show the importance of semantic precision for enhancing AI-driven language systems and suggest future research directions to bridge the gap between statistical language models and true natural language understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.

Abstract: In real practice, questions are typically complex and knowledge-intensive, requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize the multifaceted nature of the question and reason across multiple information sources. Iterative and adaptive retrieval, where LLMs decide when and what to retrieve based on their reasoning, has been shown to be a promising approach to resolve complex, knowledge-intensive questions. However, the performance of such retrieval frameworks is limited by the accumulation of reasoning errors and misaligned retrieval results. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeRare (Syntax Tree-Guided Retrieval and Reasoning), a framework that utilizes syntax trees to guide information retrieval and reasoning for question answering. Following the principle of compositionality, TreeRare traverses the syntax tree in a bottom-up fashion, and in each node, it generates subcomponent-based queries and retrieves relevant passages to resolve localized uncertainty. A subcomponent question answering module then synthesizes these passages into concise, context-aware evidence. Finally, TreeRare aggregates the evidence across the tree to form a final answer. Experiments across five question answering datasets involving ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning demonstrate that TreeRare achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper investigates a critical design decision in the practice of massively multilingual continual pre-training -- the inclusion of parallel data. Specifically, we study the impact of bilingual translation data for massively multilingual language adaptation of the Llama3 family of models to 500 languages. To this end, we construct the MaLA bilingual translation corpus, containing data from more than 2,500 language pairs. Subsequently, we develop the EMMA-500 Llama 3 suite of four massively multilingual models -- continually pre-trained from the Llama 3 family of base models extensively on diverse data mixes up to 671B tokens -- and explore the effect of continual pre-training with or without bilingual translation data. Comprehensive evaluation across 7 tasks and 12 benchmarks demonstrates that bilingual data tends to enhance language transfer and performance, particularly for low-resource languages. We open-source the MaLA corpus, EMMA-500 Llama 3 suite artefacts, code, and model generations.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought has been proven essential for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), but it also leads to high computational costs. Recent advances have explored the method to route queries among multiple models and proved it as a promising approach. However, previous works directly operate at the task level, i.e., assigning user queries to suitable LLMs, which does not allow hybrid LLMs to truly collaborate on finer-grained sub-tasks. Collaboration at the level of intermediate reasoning steps (thoughts) could enable more efficient coordination, but it also poses significant challenges for router scheduling, placing immense demands on the quality of task decomposition and the precision of the router. To address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework centered around a Reinforced Model Router designed to efficiently scale LLM reasoning. This router orchestrates collaboration across nine heterogeneous models, whose parameter scales range from less than 1B to hundreds of billions, by first breaking down a complex query into subtasks with a decomposer, and then assigning each subtask to the optimal model with a subtask allocator, balancing performance with cost. Training this router involves a two-stage alternating process for the decomposer and the allocator, integrating supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to enable effective self-supervised refinement. Extensive experiments across six challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 84.46% compared with state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining competitive reasoning accuracy. Our framework paves the way for the development of more scalable and efficient reasoning systems. Our code is open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/R2_Reasoner.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with principles like helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness typically relies on scalar rewards that obscure which objectives drive the training signal. We introduce QA-LIGN, which decomposes monolithic rewards into interpretable principle-specific evaluations through structured natural language programs. Models learn through a draft, critique, and revise pipeline, where symbolic evaluation against the rubrics provides transparent feedback for both initial and revised responses during GRPO training. Applied to uncensored Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, QA-LIGN reduces attack success rates by up to 68.7% while maintaining a 0.67% false refusal rate, achieving Pareto optimal safety-helpfulness performance and outperforming both DPO and GRPO with state-of-the-art reward models given equivalent training. These results demonstrate that making reward signals interpretable and modular improves alignment effectiveness, suggesting transparency enhances LLM safety.

Abstract: Suicide remains a leading cause of death in Western countries. As social media becomes central to daily life, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior. Focusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their channels, we investigate: How do linguistic patterns on YouTube reflect suicidal behavior, and how do these patterns align with or differ from expert knowledge? We examined linguistic changes around suicide attempts and compared individuals who attempted suicide while actively uploading to their channel with three control groups: those with prior attempts, those experiencing major life events, and matched individuals from the broader cohort. Applying complementary bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven approaches, we analyzed a novel longitudinal dataset of 181 suicide-attempt channels and 134 controls. In the bottom-up analysis, LLM-based topic-modeling identified 166 topics; five were linked to suicide attempts, two also showed attempt-related temporal changes (Mental Health Struggles, $OR = 1.74$; YouTube Engagement, $OR = 1.67$; $p < .01$). In the hybrid approach, clinical experts reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as suicide-related. However, none showed significant effects beyond those identified bottom-up. YouTube Engagement, a platform-specific indicator, was not flagged, underscoring the value of bottom-up discovery. A top-down psychological assessment of suicide narratives revealed differing motivations: individuals describing prior attempts aimed to help others ($\beta=-1.69$, $p<.01$), whereas those attempted during the uploading period emphasized personal recovery ($\beta=1.08$, $p<.01$). By integrating these approaches, we offer a nuanced understanding of suicidality, bridging digital behavior and clinical insights.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship reasoning model, O3, scores 51.5% on the originals but drops by 4.7 percentage points on surface-renaming variants, and by 12.9 percentage points on parametric variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), traditional single modality end-to-end approaches consistently fail on two critical components of natural signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in SLT with Large Language Models has side stepped this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information such as names, places, and technical terms. We introduce SignBind-LLM, a modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign, ChicagoFSWildPlus, and BOBSL datasets with a BLEU-4 score of 22.1, 73.2% letter accuracy and BLEU-4 score of 6.8 respectively. These results validate our core hypothesis: isolating and solving distinct recognition tasks before fusion provides a more powerful and effective pathway to robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

<title>Semi-Supervised Synthetic Data Generation with Fine-Grained Relevance Control for Short Video Search Relevance Modeling</title>

Abstract: Synthetic data is widely adopted in embedding models to ensure diversity in training data distributions across dimensions such as difficulty, length, and language. However, existing prompt-based synthesis methods struggle to capture domain-specific data distributions, particularly in data-scarce domains, and often overlook fine-grained relevance diversity. In this paper, we present a Chinese short video dataset with 4-level relevance annotations, filling a critical resource void. Further, we propose a semi-supervised synthetic data pipeline where two collaboratively trained models generate domain-adaptive short video data with controllable relevance labels. Our method enhances relevance-level diversity by synthesizing samples for underrepresented intermediate relevance labels, resulting in a more balanced and semantically rich training data set. Extensive offline experiments show that the embedding model trained on our synthesized data outperforms those using data generated based on prompting or vanilla supervised fine-tuning(SFT). Moreover, we demonstrate that incorporating more diverse fine-grained relevance levels in training data enhances the model's sensitivity to subtle semantic distinctions, highlighting the value of fine-grained relevance supervision in embedding learning. In the search enhanced recommendation pipeline of Douyin's dual-column scenario, through online A/B testing, the proposed model increased click-through rate(CTR) by 1.45%, raised the proportion of Strong Relevance Ratio (SRR) by 4.9%, and improved the Image User Penetration Rate (IUPR) by 0.1054%.

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves, points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web compatibility in a reusable framework.

<title>Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Evidence: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Querying UK NICE Clinical Guidelines</title>

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was evaluated against a corpus of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. Clinical evaluation by seven Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) further validated these findings, with GPT-4.1 achieving 98.7% accuracy while reducing unsafe responses by 67% compared to O4-Mini (from 3.0 to 1.0 per evaluator). This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

Abstract: Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However, such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages. Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best embedding model, though with substantial variation: models reach high performance on some datasets while struggling on notably low-resource languages. Our human annotations also reveal multiple dataset issues. We additionally benchmark nine LLMs as annotators on reranking, classification, and STS tasks, finding that they fall short of human performance (76.1% vs. 81.2%) despite offering scalability advantages. We provide human performance baselines, insights into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of results and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset, and leaderboard are publicly available at https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb.

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks. Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented, especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising 2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models. Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for autoformalization. Despite their impressive performance, these models can still struggle to produce grounded and verifiable formalizations. Recent work in text-to-SQL, has revealed that LLMs can be sensitive to paraphrased natural language (NL) inputs, even when high degrees of semantic fidelity are preserved (Safarzadeh, Oroojlooyjadid, and Roth 2025). In this paper, we investigate this claim in the autoformalization domain. Specifically, we evaluate the robustness of LLMs generating formal proofs with semantically similar paraphrased NL statements by measuring semantic and compilation validity. Using the formal benchmarks MiniF2F (Zheng, Han, and Polu 2021) and Lean 4 version of ProofNet (Xin et al. 2024), and two modern LLMs, we generate paraphrased natural language statements and cross-evaluate these statements across both models. The results of this paper reveal performance variability across paraphrased inputs, demonstrating that minor shifts in NL statements can significantly impact model outputs.

<title>SeSE: A Structural Information-Guided Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Hallucination Detection in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding ``hallucinating'' falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. SeSE operates in a zero-resource manner and is applicable to both open- and closed-source LLMs, making it an ``off-the-shelf" solution for new models and tasks. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation, we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines.

Abstract: Deep model fusion is an emerging technique that unifies the predictions or parameters of several deep neural networks into a single better-performing model in a cost-effective and data-efficient manner. Although a variety of deep model fusion techniques have been introduced, their evaluations tend to be inconsistent and often inadequate to validate their effectiveness and robustness. We present FusionBench, the first benchmark and a unified library designed specifically for deep model fusion. Our benchmark consists of multiple tasks, each with different settings of models and datasets. This variety allows us to compare fusion methods across different scenarios and model scales. Additionally, FusionBench serves as a unified library for easy implementation and testing of new fusion techniques. FusionBench is open source and actively maintained, with community contributions encouraged. Homepage https://github.com/tanganke/fusion_bench

<title>Data Mixing Can Induce Phase Transitions in Knowledge Acquisition</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained on data mixtures: most data come from web scrapes, while a small portion is curated from high-quality sources with dense domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we show that when training LLMs on such data mixtures, knowledge acquisition from knowledge-dense datasets, unlike training exclusively on knowledge-dense data (arXiv:2404.05405), does not always follow a smooth scaling law but can exhibit phase transitions with respect to the mixing ratio and model size. Through controlled experiments on a synthetic biography dataset mixed with web-scraped data, we demonstrate that: (1) as we increase the model size to a critical value, the model suddenly transitions from memorizing very few to most of the biographies; (2) below a critical mixing ratio, the model memorizes almost nothing even with extensive training, but beyond this threshold, it rapidly memorizes more biographies. We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity allocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack problem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation across datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio varies. We formalize this intuition in an information-theoretic framework and reveal that these phase transitions are predictable, with the critical mixing ratio following a power-law relationship with the model size. Our findings highlight a concrete case where a good mixing recipe for large models may not be optimal for small models, and vice versa.

Abstract: The size and compute characteristics of modern large language models have led to an increased interest in developing specialized kernels tailored for particular training and inference workloads. Existing kernels primarily optimize for compute utilization, targeting the large-batch training and inference settings. However, low-batch inference, where memory bandwidth and kernel launch overheads are significant factors, remains important for many applications of interest such as in edge deployment and latency-sensitive applications. This paper describes FlashFormer, which fuses the entire transformer forward pass into a single kernel for accelerating low-batch inference of large language models. Across various model sizes and quantizations settings, FlashFormer achieves nontrivial speedups compared to existing inference kernels.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning not only enhances large language model performance but also provides critical insights into decision-making processes, marking it as a useful tool for monitoring model intent and planning. However, recent works have shown that banning the mention of a specific example of reward hacking causes obfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the undesired behavior, threatening the reliability of CoT monitoring. We provide an extension to these results with regard to the ability of models to learn a specific type of obfuscated reasoning: steganography. First, we show that penalizing the use of specific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to substitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying method by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can learn to steganographically encode its reasoning.We further demonstrate that models can generalize an encoding scheme. When the penalized strings belong to an overarching class, the model learns not only to substitute strings seen in training, but also develops a general encoding scheme for all members of the class which it can apply to held-out testing strings.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress, state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches. Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is a core task in e-commerce search. BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning; (2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment. TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.

Abstract: We introduce the Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) activation function, a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard softmax activation function, adding Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness, and enabling interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. We further introduce the SDM estimator, based on a data-driven partitioning of the class-wise empirical CDFs via the SDM activation, to control the class- and prediction-conditional accuracy among selective classifications. When used as the final-layer activation over pre-trained language models for selective classification, the SDM estimator is more robust to co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs than existing calibration methods using softmax activations, while remaining informative over in-distribution data.

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its novel first- and second-order derivatives, named ER Velocity and ER Acceleration, to capture exploitation dynamics. Our analysis reveals that in the semantic space, exploration and exploitation could be decoupled (Sec.~4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method, Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off, VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to 21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Abstract: The rapid development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has noticeably improved the efficiency of adapting large language models. Among these, LoRA has gained widespread popularity due to its strong balance of effectiveness and parameter efficiency. However, LoRA relies on initializing two low-rank matrices whose product is zero, which limits its ability to effectively activate and leverage the original model weights-creating a potential bottleneck for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{IniLoRA}, a novel initialization strategy that initializes the low-rank matrices to closely approximate the original model weights. Experimental results indicate that IniLoRA achieves better performance than LoRA across a range of models and tasks. Additionally, we introduce two variants, IniLoRA-$\alpha$ and IniLoRA-$\beta$, both leveraging distinct initialization methods to enhance performance further.

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval. We present SynthKGQA, an LLM-powered framework for generating high-quality Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over questions. We show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better models.We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.

<div> Keywords: idiomatic language, figurative language, large language models, datasets, idiom recognition<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenges large language models (LLMs) face in understanding idiomatic and figurative language, which is prevalent in colloquial speech and social media. Despite the availability of large corpora, idioms and figurative expressions remain difficult for LLMs to process effectively. The authors highlight that finetuning approaches improve performance but emphasize the need for better and larger datasets to further close the gap. To this end, they present a diverse collection of datasets created by compiling a combined idiom list from recent figurative language datasets and extracting contextual sequences from a large corpus. The resulting resources include one large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative expressions alongside two human-annotated datasets featuring definite idioms for rigorous evaluation. These datasets were post-processed to ensure compatibility across different models and were utilized in training and evaluating pre-trained language models on idiom recognition tasks such as slot labeling and sequence tagging. The contributions offer a valuable foundation for developing new models and novel techniques aimed at improving figurative meaning understanding in NLP applications. <div>

Abstract: Idiomatic and figurative language form a large portion of colloquial speech and writing. With social media, this informal language has become more easily observable to people and trainers of large language models (LLMs) alike. While the advantage of large corpora seems like the solution to all machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, idioms and figurative language continue to elude LLMs. Finetuning approaches are proving to be optimal, but better and larger datasets can help narrow this gap even further. The datasets presented in this paper provide one answer, while offering a diverse set of categories on which to build new models and develop new approaches. A selection of recent idiom and figurative language datasets were used to acquire a combined idiom list, which was used to retrieve context sequences from a large corpus. One large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative language expressions and two additional human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic and figurative language expressions were created to evaluate the baseline ability of pre-trained language models in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition (detection) tasks. The resulting datasets were post-processed for model agnostic training compatibility, utilized in training, and evaluated on slot labeling and sequence tagging.

<div> Keywords: multimodal reasoning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, data curation, large reasoning models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces OpenMMReasoner, a transparent two-stage training approach designed to advance multimodal reasoning capabilities in large reasoning models. The first stage involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on an 874K-sample dataset, which is carefully curated with rigorous step-by-step validation to establish a solid foundation for the model's reasoning skills. Following this, the reinforcement learning (RL) stage uses a smaller but diverse 74K-sample dataset to further refine and stabilize the reasoning abilities, enhancing overall robustness and learning efficiency. Extensive evaluations across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that OpenMMReasoner outperforms strong existing baselines by achieving an 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline. The results emphasize the significance of high-quality data and carefully designed training methodologies in successfully scaling up multimodal reasoning. By releasing all codes, data, and pipelines as open source at their GitHub repository, the authors contribute a replicable and extensible framework to the research community, fostering future advancements in large-scale multimodal reasoning models. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

<div> Keywords: large language models, ethical entropy, value drift, alignment, monitoring pipeline<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of assessing large language model (LLM) safety beyond static benchmarks by focusing on dynamic failures such as value drift under distribution shift, jailbreak attacks, and alignment degradation during deployment.<br />2. It builds on the recently proposed Second Law of Intelligence, conceptualizing ethical entropy (S(t)) as a state variable that naturally tends to increase unless alignment efforts actively counterbalance it.<br />3. The authors operationalize this framework by defining a five-way behavioral taxonomy and training a classifier to estimate the ethical entropy from LLM-generated transcripts.<br />4. They test four frontier LLMs, both in their base and instruction-tuned forms, across multiple stress tests and observe that base models exhibit steady ethical entropy growth, while tuned models suppress this growth and reduce entropy by approximately 80%.<br />5. The study introduces an effective alignment work rate (gamma_eff) derived from entropy trajectories and integrates S(t) and gamma_eff into a runtime monitoring pipeline that raises alerts when ethical entropy drifts beyond stability thresholds, enabling proactive oversight and control of value drift in deployed LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large language model safety is usually assessed with static benchmarks, but key failures are dynamic: value drift under distribution shift, jailbreak attacks, and slow degradation of alignment in deployment. Building on a recent Second Law of Intelligence that treats ethical entropy as a state variable which tends to increase unless countered by alignment work, we make this framework operational for large language models. We define a five-way behavioral taxonomy, train a classifier to estimate ethical entropy S(t) from model transcripts, and measure entropy dynamics for base and instruction-tuned variants of four frontier models across stress tests. Base models show sustained entropy growth, while tuned variants suppress drift and reduce ethical entropy by roughly eighty percent. From these trajectories we estimate an effective alignment work rate gamma_eff and embed S(t) and gamma_eff in a monitoring pipeline that raises alerts when entropy drift exceeds a stability threshold, enabling run-time oversight of value drift.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Embeddings-as-a-Service, Imitation Attacks, Watermarking, Paraphrasing Attacks

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the vulnerability of Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS) models, which are built on Large Language Models (LLMs), to imitation attacks where an attacker clones the model without internal access. To protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers, watermarking techniques have been introduced that embed identifiable features into text embeddings to verify model ownership. However, the authors reveal a critical weakness in current watermarking methods by demonstrating that paraphrasing input text can effectively remove these watermarks during model cloning. This paraphrasing-based approach bypasses state-of-the-art watermark defenses across various techniques, models, and datasets, exposing a significant security gap. In response, the paper proposes a novel and more robust watermarking method named WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation). WET applies a linear transformation to embeddings and verifies watermarks by reversing this transformation and measuring similarity to the original embeddings. Experimental results confirm that WET maintains near-perfect watermark verifiability and shows strong resistance against paraphrasing-based watermark removal attacks. Additionally, detailed ablation studies are performed to analyze the influence of different components and hyperparameters in WET’s design, highlighting the importance of each element in achieving its robustness. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Based on these LLMs, businesses have started to provide Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS), offering feature extraction capabilities (in the form of text embeddings) that benefit downstream natural language processing tasks. However, prior research has demonstrated that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks, where an attacker clones the service's model in a black-box manner without access to the model's internal workings. In response, watermarks have been added to the text embeddings to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers by allowing them to check for model ownership. This thesis focuses on defending against imitation attacks by investigating EaaS watermarks. To achieve this goal, we unveil novel attacks and propose and validate new watermarking techniques.
  Firstly, we show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing the input text when attackers clone the model during imitation attacks. Our study illustrates that paraphrasing can effectively bypass current state-of-the-art EaaS watermarks across various attack setups (including different paraphrasing techniques and models) and datasets in most instances. This demonstrates a new vulnerability in recent EaaS watermarking techniques.
  Subsequently, as a countermeasure, we propose a novel watermarking technique, WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation), which employs linear transformation of the embeddings. Watermark verification is conducted by applying a reverse transformation and comparing the similarity between recovered and original embeddings. We demonstrate its robustness against paraphrasing attacks with near-perfect verifiability. We conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the significance of each component and hyperparameter in WET.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Choice-Supportive Bias, Cognitive Bias, Reasoning Dependency Generation, Debiasing

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. Recent research identifies that some Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit choice-supportive bias (CSB), where the models favor previously chosen options, undermining the objectivity of AI decision-making.  
2. Current debiasing methods mainly address demographic and social biases but fail to target cognitive biases like CSB in LLMs.  
3. This work introduces Reasoning Dependency Generation (RDG), a novel framework to mitigate CSB by generating unbiased reasoning datasets used for fine-tuning LLMs.  
4. RDG constructs balanced question-answer (QA) pairs that carefully model and unmodel dependencies between choices, evidence, and justifications, producing Contextual Dependency Data and Dependency Decouple Data across multiple domains.  
5. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on RDG-generated data achieve an 81.5% improvement in memory-based tasks and a 94.3% improvement in evaluation-based experiments, without sacrificing performance on standard benchmarks like BBQ.  
6. This approach pioneers the first effective solution for addressing cognitive biases in LLMs, advancing the reliability of AI-assisted decision support systems. <div>

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that some Large Language Models exhibit choice-supportive bias (CSB) when performing evaluations, systematically favoring their chosen options and potentially compromising the objectivity of AI-assisted decision making. While existing debiasing approaches primarily target demographic and social biases, methods for addressing cognitive biases in LLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first solution to address CSB through Reasoning Dependency Generation (RDG), a novel framework for generating unbiased reasoning data to mitigate choice-supportive bias through fine-tuning. RDG automatically constructs balanced reasoning QA pairs, explicitly (un)modeling the dependencies between choices, evidences, and justifications. Our approach is able to generate a large-scale dataset of QA pairs across domains, incorporating Contextual Dependency Data and Dependency Decouple Data. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on RDG-generated data demonstrate a 81.5% improvement in memory-based experiments and 94.3% improvement in the evaluation-based experiment, while maintaining similar performance on standard BBQ benchmarks. This work pioneers an approach for addressing cognitive biases in LLMs and contributes to the development of more reliable AI-assisted decision support systems.

The paper addresses limitations in current Text2KG methods that rely heavily on iterative prompting with Large Language Models (LLMs), which are computationally costly and often miss complex relations within text.  
2. To overcome these challenges, the authors introduce InvertiTune, a framework that combines a controlled data generation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to improve efficiency and accuracy.  
3. The data generation pipeline systematically extracts subgraphs from large knowledge bases, applies noise filtering, and uses LLMs to generate natural language descriptions from these subgraphs, leveraging the LLMs' strengths in text generation rather than direct knowledge graph extraction.  
4. This method generates datasets with longer, more realistic texts paired with larger and more complex knowledge graphs, enhancing the training process for lightweight models aimed at single-shot KG construction.  
5. Experimental evaluations on the newly created CE12k dataset demonstrate that InvertiTune surpasses larger, non-fine-tuned LLMs and current state-of-the-art Text2KG techniques, also showing superior generalization on the CrossEval-1200 test set composed of multiple benchmarks.  
6. The study highlights the critical role of high-quality, realistic training data in advancing efficient and high-performing Text2KG systems. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the ability to understand and generate text, enabling significant progress in automatic knowledge graph construction from text (Text2KG). Many Text2KG methods, however, rely on iterative LLM prompting, making them computationally expensive and prone to overlooking complex relations distributed throughout the text. To address these limitations, we propose InvertiTune, a framework that combines a controlled data generation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Within this framework, the data-generation pipeline systematically extracts subgraphs from large knowledge bases, applies noise filtering, and leverages LLMs to generate corresponding natural text descriptions, a task more aligned with LLM capabilities than direct KG generation from text. This pipeline enables generating datasets composed of longer texts paired with larger KGs that better reflect real-world scenarios compared to existing benchmarks, thus supporting effective SFT of lightweight models for single-shot KG construction. Experimental results on CE12k, a dataset generated using the introduced pipeline, show that InvertiTune outperforms larger non-fine-tuned LLMs as well as state-of-the-art Text2KG approaches, while also demonstrating stronger cross-dataset generalization on CrossEval-1200, a test set created from three established benchmark datasets and CE12k. These findings highlight the importance of realistic, high-quality training data for advancing efficient and high-performing Text2KG systems.

Abstract: Explanations are a fundamental element of how people make sense of the political world. Citizens routinely ask and answer questions about why events happen, who is responsible, and what could or should be done differently. Yet despite their importance, explanations remain an underdeveloped object of systematic analysis in political science, and existing approaches are fragmented and often issue-specific. I introduce a framework for detecting and parsing explanations in political text. To do this, I train a lightweight causal language model that returns a structured data set of causal claims in the form of cause-effect pairs for downstream analysis. I demonstrate how causal explanations can be studied at scale, and show the method's modest annotation requirements, generalizability, and accuracy relative to human coding.

<div> memorization, privacy, large language models, fine-tuning, data deduplication<br /><br />Summary:  
The article addresses the critical issue of memorization of personally identifying information (PII) in Natural Language Models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which raises significant security and privacy concerns. It introduces a novel privacy-preserving fine-tuning technique called Randomized Masked Fine-Tuning (RMFT) designed to reduce the memorization of PII while maintaining model performance. The study uses the Enron Email Dataset to evaluate RMFT, demonstrating that the method achieves an 80.81% reduction in Total Extraction Rate and an 80.17% reduction in Seen Extraction Rate compared to standard fine-tuning methods. RMFT also outperforms traditional deduplication-based privacy techniques. Despite these privacy gains, RMFT incurs only a minimal performance impact, with just a 5.73% increase in perplexity, indicating that it retains general language model utility. Additionally, the authors introduce MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework, which allows for assessing the tradeoffs between privacy and utility in language models. Using the MaxTER framework, RMFT’s performance is benchmarked against deduplication methods, employing the Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric to highlight superior privacy-utility balance. Overall, the research presents a promising approach to improving privacy in LLM fine-tuning without significantly compromising model effectiveness. <div>

We present MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework for assessing privacy-utility tradeoffs, and show the performance of RMFT vs Deduplication by Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric.

<div> Keywords: LLM-assisted annotation, bilingual discourse, code-switching, sociolinguistic patterns, Spanish-Guaraní<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study introduces a large language model (LLM)-assisted annotation pipeline designed for analyzing sociolinguistic and topical aspects of bilingual discourse in two distinct language pairs: Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaraní. It leverages LLMs to automatically label topic, genre, and discourse-pragmatic functions across 3,691 code-switched sentences. The pipeline integrates rich demographic metadata from the Miami Bilingual Corpus and adds new topic annotations to the Spanish-Guaraní dataset for enhanced analysis. The results reveal systematic correlations in the Miami data linking gender, language dominance, and discourse functions. In the Paraguayan Spanish-Guaraní data, a clear diglossic split is observed, with formal use of Guaraní contrasting informal Spanish speech. These findings replicate and extend prior interactional and sociolinguistic insights by providing corpus-scale quantitative evidence. Importantly, the study demonstrates that LLMs can reliably produce interpretable sociolinguistic patterns that traditionally required extensive manual annotation. This work advances computational approaches for cross-linguistic research, especially benefiting analyses involving low-resource bilingual contexts, showing potential to scale and enrich sociolinguistic research using artificial intelligence tools. <div>

Abstract: This study presents an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline for the sociolinguistic and topical analysis of bilingual discourse in two typologically distinct contexts: Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i. Using large language models, we automatically labeled topic, genre, and discourse-pragmatic functions across a total of 3,691 code-switched sentences, integrated demographic metadata from the Miami Bilingual Corpus, and enriched the Spanish-Guaran\'i dataset with new topic annotations. The resulting distributions reveal systematic links between gender, language dominance, and discourse function in the Miami data, and a clear diglossic division between formal Guaran\'i and informal Spanish in Paraguayan texts. These findings replicate and extend earlier interactional and sociolinguistic observations with corpus-scale quantitative evidence. The study demonstrates that large language models can reliably recover interpretable sociolinguistic patterns traditionally accessible only through manual annotation, advancing computational methods for cross-linguistic and low-resource bilingual research.

<div> Keywords: medical text simplification, persona-guided summarization, biomedical abstracts, health literacy, controllable summarization

<br /><br />Summary:  
Automatic medical text simplification is crucial for enhancing health literacy by making complex biomedical research accessible to various reader groups. Current resources typically target a single generic audience, which fails to address the diverse medical literacy levels and information needs present in different user groups. To overcome this, the study introduces PERCS (Persona-guided Controllable Summarization), a novel dataset consisting of biomedical abstracts paired with summaries tailored to four distinct personas: Laypersons, Premedical Students, Non-medical Researchers, and Medical Experts. These personas reflect varying degrees of medical knowledge and information requirements, highlighting the importance of audience-specific summarization. Each summary in the PERCS dataset was reviewed by physicians to ensure factual accuracy and alignment with the intended persona, using a detailed error taxonomy. Technical analyses reveal significant differences in readability, vocabulary, and depth of content tailored for each persona. The paper also benchmarks four large language models on this dataset using automatic evaluation metrics that measure comprehensiveness, readability, and faithfulness, providing baseline results for future studies. The dataset, along with annotation guidelines and evaluation tools, is publicly available to facilitate research on persona-specific communication and controllable summarization in the biomedical domain. <div>

Abstract: Automatic medical text simplification plays a key role in improving health literacy by making complex biomedical research accessible to diverse readers. However, most existing resources assume a single generic audience, overlooking the wide variation in medical literacy and information needs across user groups. To address this limitation, we introduce PERCS (Persona-guided Controllable Summarization), a dataset of biomedical abstracts paired with summaries tailored to four personas: Laypersons, Premedical Students, Non-medical Researchers, and Medical Experts. These personas represent different levels of medical literacy and information needs, emphasizing the need for targeted, audience-specific summarization. Each summary in PERCS was reviewed by physicians for factual accuracy and persona alignment using a detailed error taxonomy. Technical validation shows clear differences in readability, vocabulary, and content depth across personas. Along with describing the dataset, we benchmark four large language models on PERCS using automatic evaluation metrics that assess comprehensiveness, readability, and faithfulness, establishing baseline results for future research. The dataset, annotation guidelines, and evaluation materials are publicly available to support research on persona-specific communication and controllable biomedical summarization.

<div> Keywords: Autoregressive Language Models, Topic Drift, Idea-Gated Transformer, Concept Vector, Differentiable Gating

<br /><br />Summary: Autoregressive Language Models (LLMs) trained on Next-Token Prediction (NTP) often experience "Topic Drift," where generated text deviates from the initial prompt due to reliance on local token associations rather than broader semantic planning. Although increasing model size helps mitigate this issue, the underlying limitation of NTP remains unaddressed. This paper introduces the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture designed to decouple semantic planning from syntactic generation. A new auxiliary component, the "Idea Head," is trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution of a future context window, producing a latent "Concept Vector." This vector dynamically gates the main vocabulary during generation by means of a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively narrowing the search space in real time. Experiments conducted on the WikiText-103 dataset show that the Idea-Gated model maintains comparable validation perplexity relative to a standard GPT-2 baseline while significantly improving Domain Retention, meaning it better preserves the topical coherence of the generation. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations indicate that the gating mechanism successfully confines output to specific semantic clusters (e.g., Finance, Science), effectively resisting associative topic drift. This approach offers a parameter-efficient method for achieving more controllable and semantically coherent language modeling. <div>

Abstract: Autoregressive Language Models (LLMs) trained on Next-Token Prediction (NTP) often suffer from ``Topic Drift'' where the generation wanders away from the initial prompt due to a reliance on local associations rather than global planning \citep{holtzman2019curious}. While scaling model size mitigates this \citep{brown2020language}, the fundamental myopia of the NTP objective remains. In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary ``Idea Head'' trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation. We propose a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively pruning the search space in real-time. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that while the Idea-Gated model achieves comparable validation perplexity to a standard GPT-2 baseline, it exhibits significantly superior Domain Retention. Qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals that the gating mechanism successfully locks generation into specific semantic clusters (e.g., Finance, Science) and resists associative drift, offering a parameter-efficient path toward more controllable language modeling.

<div> Keywords: logical reasoning, backward reasoning, symbolic translation, hypothesis-driven, large language models  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses challenges in logical reasoning within natural language understanding, particularly the inefficiencies and inaccuracies in existing forward reasoning approaches that generate step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. The authors propose a novel framework called Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR), which innovatively combines confidence-aware symbolic translation with backward reasoning inspired by human deductive thinking. During translation, only high-confidence text spans are converted into formal logic such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain information remains in natural language to minimize translation errors. Additionally, a translation reflection module evaluates the symbolic outputs and reverts any lossy translations back to text to ensure semantic fidelity. In the reasoning phase, HBLR assumes the conclusion as true and recursively verifies its premises, mimicking the way humans reason backward from hypotheses. A reasoning reflection module detects and corrects flawed inference steps to improve logical coherence. Extensive experiments across five reasoning benchmarks show that HBLR consistently outperforms strong existing baselines in both accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing AI’s logical reasoning capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core challenge in natural language understanding and a fundamental capability of artificial intelligence, underpinning scientific discovery, mathematical theorem proving, and complex decision-making. Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), most current approaches still rely on forward reasoning paradigms, generating step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. However, such methods often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift, resulting in inefficient and unreliable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR). The core idea is to integrate confidence-aware symbolic translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning. In the translation phase, only high-confidence spans are converted into logical form, such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain content remains in natural language. A translation reflection module further ensures semantic fidelity by evaluating symbolic outputs and reverting lossy ones back to text when necessary. In the reasoning phase, HBLR simulates human deductive thinking by assuming the conclusion is true and recursively verifying its premises. A reasoning reflection module further identifies and corrects flawed inference steps, enhancing logical coherence. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HBLR consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

<div> Keywords: Higher-Order Attention, Recursive Attention, Transformers, Self-Attention, Parameter Efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces the Higher-Order Attention Network (Hon), a novel Transformer architecture aimed at overcoming the low-rank bottleneck of standard first-order self-attention mechanisms. Traditional Transformers use static linear projections for Queries and Keys, which limits their ability to capture complex, multi-hop relationships within a single layer. Hon addresses this by recursively refining Query and Key vectors through nested self-attention loops, enabling tokens to aggregate global context and model higher-order correlations before the final attention calculation. A key innovation is the parameter-efficient weight-sharing strategy applied across recursive steps, which enhances representational power without increasing parameter count, thus maintaining an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ parameter overhead. The authors provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that their approach breaks the inherent linear bottleneck present in standard attention mechanisms. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that Hon consistently outperforms standard Transformer models, validating both its theoretical advantages and empirical effectiveness. Overall, Hon represents a significant advance in attention mechanism design by merging recursive structures with weight sharing to create deeper, more expressive contextual embeddings within the Transformer framework. <div>

Abstract: Transformers have achieved significant success across various domains, relying on self-attention to capture dependencies. However, the standard first-order attention mechanism is often limited by a low-rank bottleneck, struggling to capture intricate, multi-hop relationships within a single layer. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{Higher-Order Attention Network (Hon)}, a novel architecture designed to enhance representational power through a recursive framework. Unlike standard approaches that use static linear projections for Queries and Keys, Hon dynamically refines these representations via nested self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, the Query and Key vectors are themselves outputs of inner attention loops, allowing tokens to aggregate global context and model high-order correlations \textit{prior} to the final attention computation. We enforce a parameter-efficient weight-sharing strategy across recursive steps, ensuring that this enhanced expressivity incurs $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional parameters. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our method breaks the linear bottleneck of standard attention. Empirically, Hon outperforms standard Transformers on multiple benchmarks.

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper introduces the Portal Dialogue Corpus, a dataset capturing 11.5 hours of spoken human dialogue during cooperative gameplay in Portal 2, a virtual puzzle game. This corpus includes 24,500 utterances collected from players communicating and coordinating under uncertainty in a complex environment. The authors analyze the linguistic features of the dialogues, highlighting phenomena rarely seen in typical chitchat or task-oriented dialogue datasets, such as complex spatial referencing, clarification and repair strategies, and the formation of ad-hoc conventions between players. To facilitate further research on language use within situated, collaborative problem-solving contexts, the corpus is made publicly available. The released data consists not only of audio and transcripts but also player videos, game state information, and both manual and automatic annotations of the dialogue. This comprehensive resource aims to support the study of multi-modal communication and language behavior in interactive, cooperative game settings. <div>

Abstract: Cooperative video games, where multiple participants must coordinate by communicating and reasoning under uncertainty in complex environments, yield a rich source of language data. We collect the Portal Dialogue Corpus: a corpus of 11.5 hours of spoken human dialogue in the co-op mode of the popular Portal 2 virtual puzzle game, comprising 24.5K total utterances. We analyze player language and behavior, identifying a number of linguistic phenomena that rarely appear in most existing chitchat or task-oriented dialogue corpora, including complex spatial reference, clarification and repair, and ad-hoc convention formation. To support future analyses of language use in complex, situated, collaborative problem-solving scenarios, we publicly release the corpus, which comprises player videos, audio, transcripts, game state data, and both manual and automatic annotations of language data.

<div> Low-rank adaptation, Dual LoRA, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, inductive bias, large language models  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses limitations of Low-rank adaptation (LoRA), a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method used to adapt large language models (LLMs) for specific downstream NLP tasks. The authors identify that LoRA's low-rank assumption can lead to suboptimal performance. To overcome this, they propose Dual LoRA, a novel technique introducing an inductive bias into the original LoRA framework. Dual LoRA separates the low-rank parameter matrices into two distinct groups: a magnitude group which determines if and how far parameters should be updated, and a direction group which decides the update's direction—forward or backward. This separation better simulates gradient-based full fine-tuning processes. The implementation is straightforward, involving the application of a ReLU function to the magnitude group and a sign function to the direction group. Extensive experiments are conducted across a variety of NLP tasks—natural language generation, understanding, and commonsense reasoning—using multiple base models including GPT-2, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and LLaMA versions 1, 2, and 3. Results demonstrate that Dual LoRA consistently outperforms the original LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants while maintaining the same number of trainable parameters, indicating a more effective and efficient fine-tuning approach. <div>
arXiv:2512.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most popular methods among parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to adapt pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. However, the model trained based on LoRA often has an unsatisfactory performance due to its low-rank assumption. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Dual LoRA to improve the performance by incorporating an inductive bias into the original LoRA. Specifically, we separate low-rank matrices into two groups: the magnitude group to control whether or not and how far we should update a parameter and the direction group to decide whether this parameter should move forward or backward, to better simulate the parameter updating process of the full fine-tuning based on gradient-based optimization algorithms. We show that this can be simply achieved by adding a ReLU function to the magnitude group and a sign function to the direction group. We conduct several experiments over a wide range of NLP tasks, including natural language generation (NLG), understanding (NLU), and commonsense reasoning datasets on GPT-2, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and LLaMA-1/2/3 as baseline models. The results show that we consistently outperform LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants with the same number of trainable parameters.

<title>PretrainZero: Reinforcement Active Pretraining</title>

<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03442</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: PretrainZero, reinforcement learning, active pretraining, self-supervised learning, general reasoning<br /><br />Summary:  
1) The paper presents PretrainZero, a novel reinforcement active learning framework designed to move reinforcement learning (RL) from domain-specific post-training towards more general pretraining.  
2) PretrainZero mimics human active learning by developing a unified reasoning policy that identifies and predicts informative content within the pretraining corpus, enabling active pretraining.  
3) Unlike traditional RL methods that depend on verifiable rewards or supervised fine-tuning, PretrainZero employs self-supervised learning directly on base models ranging from 3 to 30 billion parameters using only the general Wikipedia corpus, eliminating the need for labeled data.  
4) The framework introduces verification scaling by addressing progressively harder masked span prediction tasks, which significantly enhances the general reasoning ability of pretrained models.  
5) Empirical results show that PretrainZero substantially boosts performance on multiple benchmarks, including MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA, and math problem averages, with improvements of 8.43, 5.96, and 10.60 points respectively on Qwen3-4B-Base models. Furthermore, models pretrained with PretrainZero can serve as foundational reasoning models for downstream reinforcement learning with verification and reward (RLVR) tasks, demonstrating broad applicability. <div>
arXiv:2512.03442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mimicking human behavior to actively learning from general experience and achieve artificial general intelligence has always been a human dream. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) based large-thinking models demonstrate impressive expert-level abilities, i.e., software and math, but still rely heavily on verifiable rewards in specific domains, placing a significant bottleneck to extend the performance boundary of general reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose PretrainZero, a reinforcement active learning framework built on the pretraining corpus to extend RL from domain-specific post-training to general pretraining. PretrainZero features the following characteristics: 1) Active pretraining: inspired by the active learning ability of humans, PretrainZero learns a unified reasoning policy to actively identify reasonable and informative contents from pretraining corpus, and reason to predict these contents by RL. 2) Self-supervised learning: without any verifiable labels, pretrained reward models, or supervised fine-tuning, we directly pretrain reasoners from 3 to 30B base models on the general Wikipedia corpus using RL, significantly breaking the verification data-wall for general reasoning. 3) Verification scaling: by tackling increasingly challenging masked spans, PretrainZero substantially enhances the general reasoning abilities of pretrained base models. In reinforcement pretraining, PretrainZero improves Qwen3-4B-Base for 8.43, 5.96 and 10.60 on MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA and math average benchmarks. In post-training, the pretrained models can also serve as reasoning foundation models for downstream RLVR tasks.

<div> Top-k Attention, Large Language Models, Decoding, Training, Entropy<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This report examines the Top-k Attention mechanism in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on its application during both decoding and training phases to address computational cost challenges in long-context modeling.<br />2. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of exact Top-k Decoding, showing that keeping only the most relevant Keys as context during decoding achieves performance comparable to or better than full attention on tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2.<br />3. The study proposes a native Top-k Attention training strategy that aligns training and inference operations, which leads to improved unlocking of Top-k Decoding’s full potential and significantly enhanced model performance.<br />4. Due to the high complexity of exact Top-k Attention, the report investigates approximate Top-k algorithms, finding a positive correlation between downstream task performance and the precision of approximation, supported by precision statistics of the Lightning Indexer in DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp.<br />5. A theoretical interpretation from an entropy perspective reveals that models fine-tuned with Top-k Attention show reduced entropy in downstream tasks, supporting the hypothesis that low-entropy states are better suited for Top-k Decoding. <div>
arXiv:2512.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in the field of long-context modeling, however, their inference computational costs have become a critical bottleneck hindering the advancement of tasks such as agents and multimodal applications. This report conducts a preliminary investigation into the effectiveness and theoretical mechanisms of the Top-$k$ Attention mechanism during both the decoding and training phases. First, we validate the effectiveness of exact Top-$k$ Decoding through extensive experimentation. Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2. Second, we further explore the native Top-$k$ Attention training strategy. Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model. Finally, this report provides a theoretical interpretation from the perspective of Entropy. Experimental observations indicate that models subjected to Top-$k$ Attention SFT exhibit a distinct phenomenon of entropy reduction in downstream tasks, which validates the hypothesis that low-entropy states are better adapted to Top-$k$ Decoding.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, abstractive summarization, reasoning strategies, summary quality, factual faithfulness  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in abstractive summarization, a task where their reasoning capabilities have been assumed useful but not thoroughly validated. The authors adapt general reasoning strategies specifically for summarization and evaluate 8 distinct reasoning strategies across 3 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and 8 diverse datasets. They measure both the quality of summaries produced and their factual faithfulness. The findings reveal that reasoning approaches do not universally enhance summarization performance; their success varies significantly depending on the chosen reasoning strategy and contextual factors. A central observation is a trade-off between fluency and factual accuracy: explicit reasoning strategies improve the readability and flow of summaries but tend to reduce factual grounding, whereas implicit reasoning within LRMs tends to produce more factually consistent summaries but with less fluency. Additionally, increasing an LRM's internal reasoning effort, referred to as the reasoning budget, does not lead to better factual consistency and can even harm it. This suggests that effective abstractive summarization requires faithful compression of information rather than excessive or overly complex internal reasoning processes. <div>
arXiv:2512.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in analytical tasks such as mathematics and code generation, their utility for abstractive summarization remains widely assumed but largely unverified. To bridge this gap, we first tailor general reasoning strategies to the summarization domain. We then conduct a systematic, large scale comparative study of 8 reasoning strategies and 3 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) across 8 diverse datasets, assessing both summary quality and faithfulness. Our findings show that reasoning is not a universal solution and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the specific strategy and context. Specifically, we observe a trade-off between summary quality and factual faithfulness: explicit reasoning strategies tend to improve fluency at the expense of factual grounding, while implicit reasoning in LRMs exhibits the inverse pattern. Furthermore, increasing an LRM's internal reasoning budget does not improve, and can even hurt, factual consistency, suggesting that effective summarization demands faithful compression rather than creative over-thinking.

<div> Keywords: Propaganda, Narrative Classification, Indian News Media, Ideological Bias, Persuasive Techniques  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper addresses the role of narratives as cognitive and emotional frameworks in propaganda, structuring persuasive techniques into coherent stories to justify actions, assign blame, and foster ideological identification.  
2. It introduces a novel, fine-grained narrative classification scheme tailored for biased news articles, focusing on understanding article-level bias as a foundational step for narrative classification and identifying persuasive techniques.  
3. The authors present INDI-PROP, the first ideologically grounded, multi-level annotated dataset consisting of 1,266 Indian news articles that cover two divisive socio-political events: the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the Farmers' protest.  
4. Each article is annotated at three hierarchical levels: ideological bias of the article (pro-government, pro-opposition, neutral), event-specific narrative frames linked to ideological stances and communicative intent, and detailed persuasive techniques used.  
5. To perform classification tasks at these three levels, the paper proposes two frameworks guided by GPT-4o-mini: FANTA, which integrates multi-layered communicative information through information extraction and contextual framing for hierarchical reasoning, and TPTC, which uses a two-stage decomposition approach to identify persuasive cues systematically.  
6. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements of these models over baseline methods in classifying bias, narrative, and persuasive techniques within biased news content. <div>

Abstract: Narratives are the cognitive and emotional scaffolds of propaganda. They organize isolated persuasive techniques into coherent stories that justify actions, attribute blame, and evoke identification with ideological camps. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained narrative classification in biased news articles. We also explore article-bias classification as the precursor task to narrative classification and fine-grained persuasive technique identification. We develop INDI-PROP, the first ideologically grounded fine-grained narrative dataset with multi-level annotation for analyzing propaganda in Indian news media. Our dataset INDI-PROP comprises 1,266 articles focusing on two polarizing socio-political events in recent times: CAA and the Farmers' protest. Each article is annotated at three hierarchical levels: (i) ideological article-bias (pro-government, pro-opposition, neutral), (ii) event-specific fine-grained narrative frames anchored in ideological polarity and communicative intent, and (iii) persuasive techniques. We propose FANTA and TPTC, two GPT-4o-mini guided multi-hop prompt-based reasoning frameworks for the bias, narrative, and persuasive technique classification. FANTA leverages multi-layered communicative phenomena by integrating information extraction and contextual framing for hierarchical reasoning. On the other hand, TPTC adopts systematic decomposition of persuasive cues via a two-stage approach. Our evaluation suggests substantial improvement over underlying baselines in each case.

Abstract: Large Language Models have significantly advanced natural language processing tasks, but remain prone to generating incorrect or misleading but plausible arguments. This issue, known as hallucination, is particularly concerning in high-stakes domains like clinical applications, where factual inaccuracies can have severe consequences. Existing evaluation metrics fail to adequately assess factual consistency and lack interpretability, making diagnosing and mitigating errors difficult. We propose an interpretable framework for factual consistency assessment for in-domain and open-domain texts to address these limitations. Our approach decomposes text into atomic facts and introduces a flexible, schema-free methodology. Unlike previous methods with an absolute metric, we incorporate a weighted metric to enhance factual evaluation. Additionally, we propose a mechanism to control assessment complexity in intricate domains. We benchmark our approach on popular general and clinical datasets and release our code to support fact-aware model training in future research.

<div> Keywords: Generative AI, adoption, digital literacy, gender gap, Italy<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study examines the adoption and usage of generative AI (GenAI) chatbots among Italian-speaking adults, based on a survey of 1,906 participants. It reveals widespread use of GenAI for both professional and personal tasks, including sensitive areas such as emotional support and medical advice. GenAI is increasingly replacing other technologies as a primary source of information despite users’ generally low digital literacy levels. This presents risks since many users struggle to detect errors or misinformation in AI-generated content. A significant gender divide is identified, especially among older generations, with women adopting and using GenAI at about half the rate of men. While higher digital literacy correlates with greater adoption, literacy alone does not fully explain the gender gap, indicating the presence of additional barriers to equitable participation. The findings emphasize the importance of targeted educational programs to improve digital literacy and call for further research to understand and address the underlying causes of this disparity. Overall, the study provides a detailed empirical overview of GenAI use in Italy, underscoring both its societal potential and the risks associated with uneven access and awareness. <div>

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) language technologies, particularly generative AI (GenAI) chatbots accessible via conversational interfaces, is transforming digital interactions. While these tools hold societal promise, they also risk widening digital divides due to uneven adoption and low awareness of their limitations. This study presents the first comprehensive empirical mapping of GenAI adoption, usage patterns, and literacy in Italy, based on newly collected survey data from 1,906 Italian-speaking adults. Our findings reveal widespread adoption for both work and personal use, including sensitive tasks like emotional support and medical advice. Crucially, GenAI is supplanting other technologies to become a primary information source: this trend persists despite low user digital literacy, posing a risk as users struggle to recognize errors or misinformation. Moreover, we identify a significant gender divide -- particularly pronounced in older generations -- where women are half as likely to adopt GenAI and use it less frequently than men. While we find literacy to be a key predictor of adoption, it only partially explains this disparity, suggesting that other barriers are at play. Overall, our data provide granular insights into the multipurpose usage of GenAI, highlighting the dual need for targeted educational initiatives and further investigation into the underlying barriers to equitable participation that competence alone cannot explain.

<div> Hydro-Science Engineering, large language models, Hydro-SE Bench, interdisciplinary, evaluation

<br /><br />Summary: Hydro-Science and Engineering (Hydro-SE) is an interdisciplinary field essential for managing water supply, hydropower generation, and disaster mitigation related to floods and droughts. The domain requires integration of scientific knowledge with engineering expertise, demanding extensive expert collaboration, which complicates the application of artificial intelligence. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), their potential for assisting Hydro-SE tasks is being explored but remains under-evaluated. To address this gap, the authors propose Hydro-SE Bench, an evaluation benchmark comprising 4,000 multiple-choice questions across nine subfields. This benchmark assesses LLMs on basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application skills, and reasoning and calculation abilities. Evaluations reveal that commercial LLMs achieved accuracy between 0.74 and 0.80, while smaller models scored between 0.41 and 0.68. LLMs perform better in areas linked to natural and physical sciences but show limitations in domain-specific knowledge like industry standards and hydraulic structures. While model scaling enhances reasoning and calculation, significant room remains for improvement in practical engineering problem-solving. The study identifies LLM strengths and weaknesses in Hydro-SE tasks, offering model developers clear targets for training and providing Hydro-SE researchers guidance for applying LLMs effectively. <div>

Abstract: Hydro-Science and Engineering (Hydro-SE) is a critical and irreplaceable domain that secures human water supply, generates clean hydropower energy, and mitigates flood and drought disasters. Featuring multiple engineering objectives, Hydro-SE is an inherently interdisciplinary domain that integrates scientific knowledge with engineering expertise. This integration necessitates extensive expert collaboration in decision-making, which poses difficulties for intelligence. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored. However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated. To address this issue, we propose the Hydro-SE LLM evaluation benchmark (Hydro-SE Bench), which contains 4,000 multiple-choice questions. Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs. While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for Hydro-SE tasks, providing model developers with clear training targets and Hydro-SE researchers with practical guidance for applying LLMs.

<div> syntactic agreement, large language models, functional localization, cross-lingual analysis, representational spaces<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Large language models (LLMs) can reliably distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences, but the internal representation of grammatical knowledge within these models is not well understood.<br />2. The study uses a functional localization approach, inspired by cognitive neuroscience, to identify specific LLM units that respond strongly to 67 different English syntactic phenomena across seven open-weight LLMs.<br />3. These identified units are consistently activated by sentences exhibiting the syntactic phenomena and are shown to causally support the models’ syntactic performance, indicating their functional relevance.<br />4. Different types of syntactic agreement, such as subject-verb, anaphor, and determiner-noun agreement, recruit overlapping sets of LLM units, suggesting that syntactic agreement forms a coherent functional category in the LLMs' internal representations.<br />5. This pattern is stable across three languages—English, Russian, and Chinese—and extends to a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, where languages with greater structural similarity share more units for subject-verb agreement.<br />6. Overall, syntactic agreement emerges as a key marker of syntactic dependencies within the representational spaces of LLMs, shedding light on how these models internally encode grammatical structures. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can reliably distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences, but how grammatical knowledge is represented within the models remains an open question. We investigate whether different syntactic phenomena recruit shared or distinct components in LLMs. Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we identify the LLM units most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena in seven open-weight models. These units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (e.g., subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting that agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern holds in English, Russian, and Chinese; and further, in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement. Taken together, these findings reveal that syntactic agreement-a critical marker of syntactic dependencies-constitutes a meaningful category within LLMs' representational spaces.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Long-context dialogue, State Inertia, DZ-TDPO, dynamic KL constraints, temporal attention bias<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of State Inertia in long-context dialogue systems, where static constraints hinder the model's ability to reconcile evolving user intents with prior conversation history.<br />2. To overcome this, the authors propose DZ-TDPO, a novel non-destructive alignment framework that combines conflict-aware dynamic KL constraints with a learnable temporal attention bias to regulate attention precisely without harming existing knowledge.<br />3. Experiments conducted on the Multi-Session Chat (MSC) dataset demonstrate that DZ-TDPO significantly improves dialogue alignment, achieving state-of-the-art win rates of 86.2% on the Phi-3.5 model and showing strong zero-shot generalization capabilities.<br />4. The study reveals a "Capacity-Stability Trade-off": smaller models face an "alignment tax," manifested as increased perplexity, when adapting to overcome historical inertia, whereas the larger Qwen2.5-7B model achieves near-perfect alignment (99.4% win rate) with minimal perplexity cost.<br />5. This indicates that Temporal Attention Injection (TAI) can effectively address historical inertia via precise attention regulation instead of destructive weight modifications, preserving the model's general capabilities across various scales, as validated by maintained MMLU performance.<br />6. The authors have made their code and data publicly available to support reproducibility and further research. <div>

Abstract: Long-context dialogue systems suffer from State Inertia, where static constraints prevent models from resolving conflicts between evolving user intents and established historical context. To address this, we propose DZ-TDPO, a non-destructive alignment framework that synergizes conflict-aware dynamic KL constraints with a learnable temporal attention bias. Experiments on the Multi-Session Chat (MSC) dataset demonstrate that DZ-TDPO achieves state-of-the-art win rates (86.2% on Phi-3.5) while maintaining robust zero-shot generalization. Crucially, our scaling analysis reveals a "Capacity-Stability Trade-off": while smaller models incur an "alignment tax" (perplexity surge) to overcome historical inertia, the larger Qwen2.5-7B model achieves near-perfect alignment (99.4% win rate) with negligible perplexity overhead. This confirms that TAI can be alleviated via precise attention regulation rather than destructive weight updates, preserving general capabilities (MMLU) across model scales.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Medical Search, Retrieval-Augmented, Knowledge Distillation, User Satisfaction<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Accurate and reliable search capabilities are vital for online healthcare platforms to ensure user safety and service effectiveness. Traditional search methods struggle with understanding complex and nuanced medical queries, limiting their performance. To address this, the authors propose AR-Med, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) integrated with retrieval-augmented techniques to ground reasoning in verified medical knowledge, thereby enhancing accuracy and reliability. Recognizing practical constraints such as high operational costs and risks of factual hallucinations, AR-Med employs a knowledge distillation approach to compress large teacher models into smaller, efficient student models suitable for scalable online deployment. Additionally, the authors introduce LocalQSMed, a multi-expert annotated benchmark designed to guide iterative model development and ensure strong alignment between offline evaluations and real-world online performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AR-Med achieves over 93% offline accuracy, representing a 24% absolute improvement compared to the prior online system. This improvement translates into significant gains in online relevance and user satisfaction on medical delivery platforms. Overall, the work presents a practical, scalable blueprint for implementing trustworthy LLM-powered systems in high-stakes healthcare applications, overcoming knowledge gaps and ensuring safe deployment. <div>

Abstract: Accurate and reliable search on online healthcare platforms is critical for user safety and service efficacy. Traditional methods, however, often fail to comprehend complex and nuanced user queries, limiting their effectiveness. Large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution, offering powerful semantic understanding to bridge this gap. Despite their potential, deploying LLMs in this high-stakes domain is fraught with challenges, including factual hallucinations, specialized knowledge gaps, and high operational costs. To overcome these barriers, we introduce \textbf{AR-Med}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{R}elevance assessment for \textbf{Med}ical search that has been successfully deployed at scale on the Online Medical Delivery Platforms. AR-Med grounds LLM reasoning in verified medical knowledge through a retrieval-augmented approach, ensuring high accuracy and reliability. To enable efficient online service, we design a practical knowledge distillation scheme that compresses large teacher models into compact yet powerful student models. We also introduce LocalQSMed, a multi-expert annotated benchmark developed to guide model iteration and ensure strong alignment between offline and online performance. Extensive experiments show AR-Med achieves an offline accuracy of over 93\%, a 24\% absolute improvement over the original online system, and delivers significant gains in online relevance and user satisfaction. Our work presents a practical and scalable blueprint for developing trustworthy, LLM-powered systems in real-world healthcare applications.

<title>Principled RL for Diffusion LLMs Emerges from a Sequence-Level Perspective</title>

<div> Reinforcement Learning, diffusion large language models, ELBO, sequence-level optimization, policy optimization<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to diffusion large language models (dLLMs), which lack the token-level probability factorization present in autoregressive models. The authors identify the core difficulty as the mismatch in likelihood approximation, since dLLMs generate sequences through iterative, non-autoregressive denoising steps that do not naturally yield token-level conditional probabilities needed for conventional token-level RL objectives. To resolve this, the paper proposes ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a novel RL framework treating entire sequence generation as a single action and employing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) as a tractable proxy for sequence-level likelihood. ESPO enhances training stability by incorporating per-token normalization of importance ratios and a robust estimation of KL-divergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ESPO outperforms existing token-level RL baselines across tasks such as mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning. Notably, it achieves dramatic improvements, with 20-40 point gains on the Countdown benchmark, while delivering consistent advances on other math and coding challenges. The study establishes sequence-level optimization as a principled and effective approach for reinforcement learning in dLLMs. The authors provide their code publicly at the given GitHub repository to facilitate further research. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective for autoregressive language models, but adapting these methods to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) presents fundamental challenges. The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks. Our approach establishes sequence-level optimization as a principled and empirically effective paradigm for RL in dLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/ESPO.

<div> Doublespeak, in-context representation hijacking, large language models, semantic overwrite, safety alignment<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper introduces Doublespeak, a novel attack technique targeting large language models (LLMs) by manipulating their in-context representations.<br /><br />2. The attack replaces harmful keywords (e.g., "bomb") with benign tokens (e.g., "carrot") across multiple in-context examples preceding a harmful prompt, effectively hijacking the model’s internal semantic representations.<br /><br />3. This token substitution causes the representation of the benign word to converge toward the harmful one, meaning that seemingly innocuous prompts like "How to build a carrot?" are internally interpreted as harmful instructions such as "How to build a bomb?", circumventing existing safety measures.<br /><br />4. The authors use interpretability methods to reveal that this semantic overwrite happens progressively across layers, with benign meanings at early layers transitioning into harmful semantics in deeper layers.<br /><br />5. Doublespeak requires no optimization, works across different model families including closed- and open-source models, and achieves a high attack success rate (74%) on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with just a one-sentence context override.<br /><br />The study highlights a new potential vulnerability in LLMs’ latent spaces and suggests that current alignment approaches are insufficient, calling for representation-level defenses to prevent such attacks. <div>
arXiv:2512.03771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Doublespeak}, a simple \emph{in-context representation hijacking} attack against large language models (LLMs). The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones. Doublespeak is optimization-free, broadly transferable across model families, and achieves strong success rates on closed-source and open-source systems, reaching 74\% ASR on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a single-sentence context override. Our findings highlight a new attack surface in the latent space of LLMs, revealing that current alignment strategies are insufficient and should instead operate at the representation level.

<title>Enhancing Instruction-Following Capabilities in Seq2Seq Models: DoLA Adaptations for T5</title>

<div> Keywords: Contrastive decoding, DoLa, encoder-decoder architecture, instruction following, faithfulness<br /><br />Summary: This paper explores the adaptation of DoLa (Decoding by Contrastive Layers), a contrastive decoding method previously applied only in decoder-only language models, to encoder-decoder architectures specifically the T5 and FLAN-T5 model families. It is the first known implementation of contrastive decoding in such architectures. The study focuses on how DoLa influences the models' ability to follow instructions during text generation. Experimental results indicate that DoLa enhances the faithfulness and factual accuracy of generated text in certain categories of tasks, while negatively affecting performance in others. To better understand these mixed outcomes, the authors perform a layer-by-layer analysis of how token output probabilities evolve across the layers of a FLAN-T5 model when using DoLa. This analysis sheds light on how the contrastive decoding process alters model outputs at different depths, providing insight into when and why DoLa helps or hinders instruction-following behavior. Overall, the work advances the understanding of inference-time strategies for improving large language model output quality in encoder-decoder frameworks, highlighting both benefits and limitations. <div>

Abstract: Contrastive decoding is a lightweight and effective inference-time method that improves the quality of text generation in Large Language Models. However, algorithms such as DoLa (Decoding by Contrastive Layers) have only been implemented in decoder-only architectures and studied for their impact on improving factuality. This work adapts DoLa for the T5 and FLAN-T5 model families and evaluates its impact on the models' instruction following capabilities, which to our knowledge is the first implementation of a contrastive decoding strategy in an encoder-decoder architecture. Our results show that DoLa improves the faithfulness of text generation for certain categories of tasks and harms others. To understand these results, we present a layer-by-layer analysis of logit evolution in a FLAN-T5 model to quantify DoLa's impact on token output probabilities.

<div> Keywords: large language models, prompt engineering, text classification, psychology constructs, few-shot learning  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study investigates the impact of prompt wording on the text classification performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly in domains like psychology where text constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions. The authors propose an empirical framework to optimize LLM classification performance by extensive prompt engineering. They experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies: codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting, under both zero-shot and few-shot conditions. Results reveal that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanatory prompting alone do not fully mitigate the negative effects of poorly worded prompts. Instead, the most critical aspects influencing performance are the inclusion of a clear construct definition, appropriate task framing, and relevant examples. Across three psychological constructs and two different LLMs, the highest agreement with expert human judgments was achieved using few-shot prompting that combined codebook-based empirical prompt selection and automatic prompt engineering. Based on these findings, the authors recommend that researchers generate and test a large variety of prompt variants, both human-crafted and automatically generated, selecting the best based on empirical performance on training data and then validating on holdout sets. This approach provides a systematic, theory-driven method to enhance LLM alignment with expert labels in sensitive application areas. <div>
arXiv:2512.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their architecture and vast pre-training data, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text classification performance. However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, medical consensus guidelines, large language models, Sepsis-3, time series forecasting<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of generating faithful explanations in medical machine learning, emphasizing trust by medical practitioners. It proposes fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to follow step-by-step medical consensus guidelines during reasoning and prediction, using verbalized medical inference rules instantiated from electronic health records as training data. The approach enables automatic evaluation of the model’s inference through derivation correctness (logical fidelity to premises) and value correctness (accuracy of predicted clinical values). The Sepsis-3 consensus definition serves as a complex example to validate the method. Experiments demonstrate that small fine-tuned models outperform much larger LLMs using one-shot learning or models trained on broad medical texts including consensus guidelines. Fine-tuning on domain-specific rule instantiations yields near-perfect reasoning on unseen patient data within that area. The main bottleneck for early prediction is not poor out-of-distribution generalization but the difficulty of forecasting future clinical variables that are sparsely and irregularly sampled. To address this, the paper integrates time series forecasting model outputs with the LLM in a multimodal framework, improving prediction performance by leveraging temporal context alongside rule-based reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2512.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.

<title>Reconstructing KV Caches with Cross-layer Fusion For Enhanced Transformers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03870</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03870</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Transformer decoders, KV cache, cross-layer sharing, FusedKV, memory efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Transformer decoders are effective but face high memory costs due to the large key-value (KV) cache at long sequence lengths.<br />2. Existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods (e.g., YOCO, CLA) reduce memory usage but generally perform worse than within-layer methods like GQA.<br />3. The authors analyze the information flow in top-layer keys and values, finding values mainly come from the bottom layer, while keys combine information from both bottom and middle layers.<br />4. Based on this insight, they introduce FusedKV, which creates top-layer KV caches by fusing the most informative bottom- and middle-layer KV caches using a learnable fusion method applied directly on post-RoPE keys, maintaining relative positional information without expensive recomputation.<br />5. To further boost efficiency, they propose FusedKV-Lite, which derives top-layer KV caches directly from bottom-layer values and middle-layer keys, trading a slight perplexity increase for reduced I/O overhead.<br />6. Experiments on large language models ranging from 332 million to 4 billion parameters show FusedKV methods reduce KV cache memory usage by 50% while achieving lower validation perplexity compared to standard Transformer decoders.<br />7. The work establishes FusedKV as a memory-efficient, high-performance alternative architecture for Transformer decoders in long-sequence generation scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2512.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer decoders have achieved strong results across tasks, but the memory required for the KV cache becomes prohibitive at long sequence lengths. Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative.

<div> Keywords: language models, linguistic diversity, Basque, low-resource languages, model robustness  

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the limitations of current language models that rely heavily on massive, quality-filtered text corpora, which often exclude non-standard linguistic varieties such as dialectal, historical, and informal language. The authors argue for the importance of capturing the full spectrum of language variation to enhance model robustness and reduce representational biases. Focusing on Basque, a morphologically complex and low-resource language, they create new corpora by combining standard texts with data from social media and historical sources. They pre-train the BERnaT family of encoder-only models under three data configurations: standard, diverse, and combined. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel evaluation framework that separates Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks into standard and diverse subsets, enabling assessment of a model’s linguistic generalization abilities. Experimental results reveal that models trained on both standard and diverse datasets consistently outperform those trained solely on standard corpora, with improvements observed across all task categories without any loss in accuracy on traditional benchmarks. Overall, the study emphasizes that incorporating linguistic diversity is crucial for developing inclusive and more generalizable language models, particularly for low-resource languages like Basque. <div>

Abstract: Language models depend on massive text corpora that are often filtered for quality, a process that can unintentionally exclude non-standard linguistic varieties, reduce model robustness and reinforce representational biases. In this paper, we argue that language models should aim to capture the full spectrum of language variation (dialectal, historical, informal, etc.) rather than relying solely on standardized text. Focusing on Basque, a morphologically rich and low-resource language, we construct new corpora combining standard, social media, and historical sources, and pre-train the BERnaT family of encoder-only models in three configurations: standard, diverse, and combined. We further propose an evaluation framework that separates Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks into standard and diverse subsets to assess linguistic generalization. Results show that models trained on both standard and diverse data consistently outperform those trained on standard corpora, improving performance across all task types without compromising standard benchmark accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of linguistic diversity in building inclusive, generalizable language models.

Abstract: While recent developments in large language models have improved bias detection and classification, sensitive subjects like religion still present challenges because even minor errors can result in severe misunderstandings. In particular, multilingual models often misrepresent religions and have difficulties being accurate in religious contexts. To address this, we introduce BRAND: Bilingual Religious Accountable Norm Dataset, which focuses on the four main religions of South Asia: Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam, containing over 2,400 entries, and we used three different types of prompts in both English and Bengali. Our results indicate that models perform better in English than in Bengali and consistently display bias toward Islam, even when answering religion-neutral questions. These findings highlight persistent bias in multilingual models when similar questions are asked in different languages. We further connect our findings to the broader issues in HCI regarding religion and spirituality.

<div> Keywords: Tibetan adaptation, large language models, continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, low-resource languages  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of adapting large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages, focusing on Tibetan, a morphologically rich and underrepresented language. The authors propose a two-stage adaptation approach applied to the Qwen2.5-3B model. First, Continual Pretraining (CPT) is used to build a foundational Tibetan linguistic understanding, effectively creating a semantic manifold for the language. Second, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) specializes the model for specific tasks, particularly improving Chinese-to-Tibetan translation. Empirical results show a significant reduction in perplexity from 2.98 to 1.54, indicating enhanced language modeling performance. Translation quality metrics also improve substantially, with BLEU scores rising from 0.046 to 0.261, and chrF scores from 2.2 to 6.6. A detailed layer-wise analysis on a larger variant, Qwen3-4B with 435 layers, reveals that model adaptation is concentrated primarily in the embedding layers and output heads, while mid-to-late multilayer perceptron (MLP) projections encode domain-specific transformations. The study concludes that CPT builds broad Tibetan knowledge with minimal disruption to the model’s overall representation, while SFT helps refine task alignment. This work is the first quantitative study on Tibetan adaptation in LLMs and offers an open framework for extending foundation models to other low-resource languages. <div>

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and cross-lingual drift. This work presents a two-stage adaptation of Qwen2.5-3B to Tibetan, a morphologically rich and underrepresented language. We employ Continual Pretraining (CPT) to establish Tibetan linguistic grounding, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task and translation specialization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent decrease in perplexity (from 2.98 $\rightarrow$ 1.54) and substantial improvements in Chinese$\rightarrow$Tibetan translation quality (BLEU: 0.046 $\rightarrow$ 0.261; chrF: 2.2 $\rightarrow$ 6.6). Layer-wise analysis across 435 layers in Qwen3-4B reveals that adaptation primarily concentrates on embedding and output heads, with mid--late MLP projections encoding domain-specific transformations. Our findings suggest that CPT constructs a Tibetan semantic manifold while SFT sharpens task alignment with minimal representational disruption. This study provides the first quantitative exploration of Tibetan adaptation dynamics for LLMs, and offers an open, reproducible framework for extending multilingual foundation models to low-resource settings.

<div> Tokenizer adaptation, vocabulary extension, vocabulary pruning, BPE training, tokenization efficiency<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses tokenizer adaptation for transferring pre-trained language models to new domains or languages, focusing on two main aspects: vocabulary extension and pruning. The conventional method for vocabulary extension involves training a new tokenizer on domain-specific text and appending non-overlapping tokens to the existing vocabulary, which often leads to many unused or unreachable tokens. To counter this, the authors propose continued BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) training, which adapts a pre-trained tokenizer by continuing the BPE merge learning process with new data, resulting in improved tokenization efficiency and better utilization of the extended vocabulary. Additionally, the paper introduces leaf-based vocabulary pruning, a technique that removes redundant tokens from the vocabulary while maintaining the model’s performance and quality. Experimental results across multiple languages and various model families demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches. Both techniques provide practical and controlled methods for modifying the tokenizer vocabulary in domain adaptation scenarios. The authors also release their methods as an open-source package, enabling broader use and experimentation in adapting tokenizers efficiently without sacrificing model quality. <div>

Abstract: Tokenizer adaptation plays an important role in transferring pre-trained language models to new domains or languages. In this work, we address two complementary aspects of this process: vocabulary extension and pruning. The common approach to extension trains a new tokenizer on domain-specific text and appends the tokens that do not overlap with the existing vocabulary, which often results in many tokens that are unreachable or never used. We propose continued BPE training, which adapts a pre-trained tokenizer by continuing the BPE merge learning process on new data. Experiments across multiple languages and model families show that this approach improves tokenization efficiency and leads to better utilization of added vocabulary. We also introduce leaf-based vocabulary pruning, which removes redundant tokens while preserving model quality. Together, these methods provide practical tools for controlled vocabulary modification, which we release as an open-source package.

<div> Keywords: augmented LLMs, inference serving, request scheduling, effective throughput, dynamic batching<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenges faced by augmented large language model (LLM) inference systems in web applications, focusing on improving efficiency and meeting service-level objectives (SLOs). The authors identify two main issues in existing systems: the use of first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling which causes head-of-line blocking and queuing delays, and a static batch token limit that does not adapt to changing load and hardware conditions. To overcome these limitations, the paper introduces AugServe, an inference framework designed to reduce queuing latency and boost effective throughput. AugServe employs a novel two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy—initially optimizing scheduling order based on inference features of LLM requests, then refining these decisions dynamically using real-time runtime data to adapt to request characteristics and system capabilities. Additionally, AugServe incorporates a dynamic token batching mechanism that adjusts according to hardware status and current workload, further improving throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that AugServe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems like vLLM and InferCept, achieving between 3.3x to 33.1x higher effective throughput and reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency by up to 96.3%, thereby enhancing both efficiency and user experience in augmented LLM inference services. <div>
arXiv:2512.04013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As augmented large language models (LLMs) with external tools become increasingly popular in web applications, improving augmented LLM inference serving efficiency and optimizing service-level objectives (SLOs) are critical for enhancing user experience. To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality.
  This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively.

<div> Skills, Reinforcement Learning, Fine-Tuning, Cognitive Abilities, Robustness<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper introduces SkillFactory, a method designed to help language models acquire advanced cognitive skills during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before applying reinforcement learning (RL).<br /><br />2. Unlike previous approaches that rely on distillation from stronger models, SkillFactory generates "silver" training data by rearranging samples from the base model itself, which helps the model roughly learn skills such as verification, backtracking, and retrying.<br /><br />3. Although these generated SFT traces are imperfect, they effectively prime the model for skill acquisition during subsequent RL training.<br /><br />4. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that models initialized with SkillFactory SFT generalize better to harder task variants after RL, even if their pre-RL performance is lower.<br /><br />5. Additionally, SkillFactory-enhanced models are shown to use cognitive skills more reliably and exhibit greater robustness to performance regression on out-of-domain tasks compared to models fine-tuned and RL-trained without SkillFactory.<br /><br />6. The authors conclude that embedding inductive biases related to cognitive skill use during SFT provides a beneficial foundation for RL, leading to more robust and capable reasoning models. <div>
arXiv:2512.04072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning models leveraging long chains of thought employ various cognitive skills, such as verification of their answers, backtracking, retrying by an alternate method, and more. Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly learn these skills during a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Our approach does not rely on distillation from a stronger model, but instead uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data in the format of those skills. These "silver" SFT traces may be imperfect, but are nevertheless effective for priming a model to acquire skills during RL. Our evaluation shows that (1) starting from SkillFactory SFT initialization helps a model to generalize to harder variants of a task post-RL, despite lower performance pre-RL; (2) cognitive skills are indeed used by the model; (3) RLed SkillFactory models are more robust to regression on out-of-domain tasks than RLed base models. Our work suggests that inductive biases learned prior to RL help models learn robust cognitive skill use.

<div> hallucination detection, semantic entropy, perplexity decomposition, large language models, evidence utilization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent but factually unsupported answers known as hallucinations, which pose risks in high-stakes domains.  
2. The paper introduces ECLIPSE, a novel framework that views hallucination as a mismatch between a model's semantic entropy and the capacity of available evidence.  
3. ECLIPSE combines entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with a new perplexity decomposition method that evaluates how models utilize retrieved evidence during generation.  
4. The authors prove under mild assumptions that the entropy-capacity objective used in ECLIPSE is strictly convex and has a unique stable optimum, ensuring reliable optimization.  
5. Evaluation on a controlled financial question answering dataset using GPT-3.5-turbo (200 balanced samples, including synthetic hallucinations) shows ECLIPSE achieves high detection performance with ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, significantly outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50).  
6. Ablation with Claude-3-Haiku, which provides no token-level log probabilities, results in a substantial performance drop (AUC 0.59) and coefficient magnitude decrease, highlighting ECLIPSE’s dependence on calibrated token-level log probabilities.  
7. The perplexity decomposition features have the largest learned coefficients, emphasizing that how evidence is utilized by the model is central to effective hallucination detection.  
8. The work is positioned as a controlled mechanism study, with broader validation on other domains and natural hallucinations to be addressed in future research. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce fluent but unsupported answers - hallucinations - limiting safe deployment in high-stakes domains. We propose ECLIPSE, a framework that treats hallucination as a mismatch between a model's semantic entropy and the capacity of available evidence. We combine entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with a novel perplexity decomposition that measures how models use retrieved evidence. We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum. We evaluate on a controlled financial question answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (n=200 balanced samples with synthetic hallucinations), where ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, substantially outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50). A controlled ablation with Claude-3-Haiku, which lacks token-level log probabilities, shows AUC dropping to 0.59 with coefficient magnitudes decreasing by 95% - demonstrating that ECLIPSE is a logprob-native mechanism whose effectiveness depends on calibrated token-level uncertainties. The perplexity decomposition features exhibit the largest learned coefficients, confirming that evidence utilization is central to hallucination detection. We position this work as a controlled mechanism study; broader validation across domains and naturally occurring hallucinations remains future work.

<div> Culture bias, Vision-Language datasets, function-centric framework, socioeconomic gaps, Culture Affordance Atlas<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses cultural biases present in mainstream Vision-Language (VL) datasets, which predominantly reflect higher-income, Western contexts, leading to reduced generalizability and performance disparities that negatively affect lower-income and non-Western populations. To mitigate these disparities, the authors propose a novel function-centric framework that categorizes objects based on the functions they serve across various cultural and economic contexts, rather than relying solely on object identity. They implement this framework through the creation of the Culture Affordance Atlas, a culturally grounded and re-annotated version of the Dollar Street dataset, encompassing 46 distinct functions and 288 objects. This dataset is publicly accessible online. Through extensive empirical evaluation using the CLIP model, results show that labeling objects by function significantly reduces performance gaps between high- and low-income groups by a median of 6 percentage points, a statistically significant improvement, thereby enhancing model effectiveness in lower-income settings. Additionally, the analysis reveals many culturally essential objects commonly omitted in leading VL datasets. Overall, this work presents a scalable and inclusive approach for constructing VL datasets that promote equitable AI systems across diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. <div>

Abstract: Culture shapes the objects people use and for what purposes, yet mainstream Vision-Language (VL) datasets frequently exhibit cultural biases, disproportionately favoring higher-income, Western contexts. This imbalance reduces model generalizability and perpetuates performance disparities, especially impacting lower-income and non-Western communities. To address these disparities, we propose a novel function-centric framework that categorizes objects by the functions they fulfill, across diverse cultural and economic contexts. We implement this framework by creating the Culture Affordance Atlas, a re-annotated and culturally grounded restructuring of the Dollar Street dataset spanning 46 functions and 288 objects publicly available at https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/CultureAffordance-Atlas/index.html. Through extensive empirical analyses using the CLIP model, we demonstrate that function-centric labels substantially reduce socioeconomic performance gaps between high- and low-income groups by a median of 6 pp (statistically significant), improving model effectiveness for lower-income contexts. Furthermore, our analyses reveals numerous culturally essential objects that are frequently overlooked in prominent VL datasets. Our contributions offer a scalable pathway toward building inclusive VL datasets and equitable AI systems.

<div> Process reward models, reinforcement learning, synthetic training data, mathematical reasoning, self-consistency verification<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper introduces SPARK, a novel three-stage framework designed to improve process reward models (PRMs) for reinforcement learning without requiring costly step-level annotations or reference solutions. First, SPARK uses a generator model to produce diverse solutions, and a verifier model evaluates these solutions through parallel scaling (self-consistency) and sequential scaling (meta-critique). Second, the verifier outputs are used as synthetic training data to fine-tune generative process reward models, which then act as reward functions during training. Aggregating multiple step-level independent verifications in training results in PRMs that outperform ground-truth outcome supervision, demonstrated by achieving 67.5 F1 on ProcessBench, surpassing both reference-guided training (66.4) and GPT-4o (61.9). The final stage employs the fine-tuned generative PRM combined with chain-of-thought verification (PRM-CoT) as a reward model in reinforcement learning experiments targeting mathematical reasoning tasks. Format constraints are introduced in this stage to prevent reward hacking. Using the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model, the approach achieves a 47.4% average accuracy across six mathematical benchmarks, outperforming ground-truth-based RLVR (43.9%). This work enables scalable, reference-free reinforcement learning methods, especially valuable for domains lacking verifiable answers or ground truth data. <div>

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) that provide dense, step-level feedback have shown promise for reinforcement learning, yet their adoption remains limited by the need for expensive step-level annotations or ground truth references. We propose SPARK: a three-stage framework where in the first stage a generator model produces diverse solutions and a verifier model evaluates them using parallel scaling (self-consistency) and sequential scaling (meta-critique). In the second stage, we use these verification outputs as synthetic training data to fine-tune generative process reward models, which subsequently serve as reward signals during training. We show that aggregating multiple independent verifications at the step level produces training data for process reward models that surpass ground-truth outcome supervision, achieving 67.5 F1 on ProcessBench (a benchmark for identifying erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning) compared to 66.4 for reference-guided training and 61.9 for GPT-4o. In the final stage, we apply our generative PRM with chain-of-thought verification (PRM-CoT) as the reward model in RL experiments on mathematical reasoning, and introduce format constraints to prevent reward hacking. Using Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we achieve 47.4% average accuracy across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming ground-truth-based RLVR (43.9%). Our work enables reference-free RL training that exceeds ground-truth methods, opening new possibilities for domains lacking verifiable answers or accessible ground truth.

The paper introduces vibe coding, a programming paradigm where human engineers supervise large language model (LLM) agents to handle complex coding tasks with minimal oversight. <br /><br />2. The core question addressed is whether vibe coding outputs are safe enough to be deployed in production, especially regarding software security. <br /><br />3.

The study evaluates multiple popular coding agents powered by state-of-the-art LLMs on this benchmark. Results reveal poor security performance overall—though some solutions are functionally correct, only a small fraction are secure. For example, SWE-Agent combined with Claude 4 Sonnet achieves 61% functional correctness but just 10.5% security compliance. <br /><br />5. Attempts to improve security using preliminary strategies, such as including vulnerability hints in task descriptions, fail to significantly mitigate the security flaws. <br /><br />6. The findings raise serious concerns about the risks of adopting vibe coding widely, particularly in security-critical software development contexts. <div>

Abstract: Vibe coding is a new programming paradigm in which human engineers instruct large language model (LLM) agents to complete complex coding tasks with little supervision. Although it is increasingly adopted, are vibe coding outputs really safe to deploy in production? To answer this question, we propose SU S VI B E S, a benchmark consisting of 200 feature-request software engineering tasks from real-world open-source projects, which, when given to human programmers, led to vulnerable implementations. We evaluate multiple widely used coding agents with frontier models on this benchmark. Disturbingly, all agents perform poorly in terms of software security. Although 61% of the solutions from SWE-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet are functionally correct, only 10.5% are secure. Further experiments demonstrate that preliminary security strategies, such as augmenting the feature request with vulnerability hints, cannot mitigate these security issues. Our findings raise serious concerns about the widespread adoption of vibe-coding, particularly in security-sensitive applications.

<div> Keywords: Wikipedia, Grokipedia, epistemic profiles, citation networks, generative AI

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study compares the epistemic foundations of AI- and human-curated encyclopedias by analyzing citation networks from 72 matched article pairs, totaling nearly 60,000 sources. It applies an 8-category epistemic classification to map the "epistemic profiles" of articles on Wikipedia and Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia. Findings show Grokipedia reduces reliance on peer-reviewed academic sources, favoring more "User-generated" and "Civic organization" references compared to Wikipedia’s traditional authority-based sourcing. The analysis reveals distinct epistemological profiles depending on the article topic: Grokipedia uses different sourcing strategies for leisure topics like Sports and Entertainment versus socially sensitive topics such as Politics, Conflicts, and Society. A novel scaling-law is identified, demonstrating a linear relationship between article length and citation density in AI-generated content, contrasting with patterns in human-written Wikipedia articles. The study concludes that LLM-based encyclopedias like Grokipedia do not simply automate knowledge curation but fundamentally restructure epistemic sourcing and justification. Given the significant shifts observed and the critical societal role of encyclopedias, the authors recommend ongoing and deeper algorithmic audits to better grasp these evolving epistemological transformations. <div>

Abstract: A quarter century ago, Wikipedia's decentralized, crowdsourced, and consensus-driven model replaced the centralized, expert-driven, and authority-based standard for encyclopedic knowledge curation. The emergence of generative AI encyclopedias, such as Grokipedia, possibly presents another potential shift in epistemic evolution. This study investigates whether AI- and human-curated encyclopedias rely on the same foundations of authority. We conducted a multi-scale comparative analysis of the citation networks from 72 matched article pairs, which cite a total of almost 60,000 sources. Using an 8-category epistemic classification, we mapped the "epistemic profiles" of the articles on each platform. Our findings reveal several quantitative and qualitative differences in how knowledge is sourced and encyclopedia claims are epistemologically justified. Grokipedia replaces Wikipedia's heavy reliance on peer-reviewed "Academic & Scholarly" work with a notable increase in "User-generated" and "Civic organization" sources. Comparative network analyses further show that Grokipedia employs very different epistemological profiles when sourcing leisure topics (such as Sports and Entertainment) and more societal sensitive civic topics (such as Politics & Conflicts, Geographical Entities, and General Knowledge & Society). Finally, we find a "scaling-law for AI-generated knowledge sourcing" that shows a linear relationship between article length and citation density, which is distinct from collective human reference sourcing. We conclude that this first implementation of an LLM-based encyclopedia does not merely automate knowledge production but restructures it. Given the notable changes and the important role of encyclopedias, we suggest the continuation and deepening of algorithm audits, such as the one presented here, in order to understand the ongoing epistemological shifts.

<title>LLM-Generated Ads: From Personalization Parity to Persuasion Superiority</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, personalized advertising, psychological persuasion, AI-generated ads, advertising effectiveness<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper presents a two-part study exploring the effectiveness of large language model (LLM)-generated advertisements through personality-based and psychological persuasion frameworks. First, with a sample of 400 participants, the authors assessed whether LLMs could produce ads tailored to specific personality traits (openness and neuroticism) and compared their performance with human experts. Results indicated LLM-generated ads matched human-written ads statistically (51.1% vs. 48.9%, p > 0.05), showing no significant difference when ads were matched to personality. Building on this, the second study with 800 participants evaluated LLM ads using four psychological persuasion principles: authority, consensus, cognition, and scarcity. Here, AI-generated ads significantly outperformed human ads (59.1% vs. 40.9%, p < 0.001), particularly in authority (63.0%) and consensus (62.5%) appeals. Qualitative analysis suggested AI’s advantage arises from more sophisticated, aspirational messaging and better visual-narrative coherence. Even when adjusting for participant detection of AI origin (a 21.2 percentage point penalty), AI ads maintained superiority, with nearly 30% favoring AI content despite awareness of its source. These findings highlight LLMs’ progression from parity in personalized advertising to superiority in universal persuasion, offering significant implications due to AI’s near-zero marginal costs and rapid output relative to human expertise. <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable of generating persuasive content, understanding their effectiveness across different advertising strategies becomes critical. This paper presents a two-part investigation examining LLM-generated advertising through complementary lenses: (1) personality-based and (2) psychological persuasion principles.
  In our first study (n=400), we tested whether LLMs could generate personalized advertisements tailored to specific personality traits (openness and neuroticism) and how their performance compared to human experts. Results showed that LLM-generated ads achieved statistical parity with human-written ads (51.1% vs. 48.9%, p > 0.05), with no significant performance differences for matched personalities.
  Building on these insights, our second study (n=800) shifted focus from individual personalization to universal persuasion, testing LLM performance across four foundational psychological principles: authority, consensus, cognition, and scarcity. AI-generated ads significantly outperformed human-created content, achieving a 59.1% preference rate (vs. 40.9%, p < 0.001), with the strongest performance in authority (63.0%) and consensus (62.5%) appeals. Qualitative analysis revealed AI's advantage stems from crafting more sophisticated, aspirational messages and achieving superior visual-narrative coherence. Critically, this quality advantage proved robust: even after applying a 21.2 percentage point detection penalty when participants correctly identified AI-origin, AI ads still outperformed human ads, and 29.4% of participants chose AI content despite knowing its origin. These findings demonstrate LLMs' evolution from parity in personalization to superiority in persuasive storytelling, with significant implications for advertising practice given LLMs' near-zero marginal cost and time requirements compared to human experts.

<title>Text-Printed Image: Bridging the Image-Text Modality Gap for Text-centric Training of Large Vision-Language Models</title>

<div> Keywords: vision-language models, text-centric training, Text-Printed Image, VQA, synthetic data augmentation<br /><br />Summary:<br />Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been effective for visual question answering (VQA) but require large amounts of image-text pairs for fine-tuning, which are costly and difficult to collect. This work proposes text-centric training, relying exclusively on textual descriptions without using real images, to enable low-cost scaling of data. Text is more widely available and easily editable compared to images, allowing creation and diversification of training data using large language models (LLMs) with minimal human effort. To overcome the modality gap between text and images that limits gains on VQA tasks, the authors introduce the Text-Printed Image (TPI) method, which generates synthetic images by rendering the text descriptions on a plain white canvas. This simple technique projects text into the image modality while preserving semantic content better than current text-to-image diffusion models. Extensive experiments across four LVLM architectures and seven VQA benchmarks demonstrate that TPI outperforms diffusion-generated synthetic images for text-centric training. Additionally, TPI is explored as a low-cost data augmentation strategy, showing practical benefits for enhancing LVLM performance. Overall, the study highlights the promise of fully automated text-based data generation as a scalable and cost-effective approach for improving LVLM training and VQA capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been applied to diverse VQA tasks. However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs.

<div> Keywords: adversarial stylometry, TraceTarnish, stylometric features, Information Gain, authorship anonymization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This study rigorously evaluates the attack script named TraceTarnish, designed to anonymize authorship of text messages by leveraging adversarial stylometry techniques.<br /><br />2. The authors collected and processed Reddit comments, transforming them into TraceTarnish data to analyze stylistic changes caused by the attack.<br /><br />3. Stylometric features were extracted and augmented using StyloMetrix, then filtered by Information Gain to retain the most informative and discriminative markers.<br /><br />4. Key stylometric cues identified include frequencies of function words ($L\_FUNC\_A$ and $L\_FUNC\_T$), content words ($L\_CONT\_A$ and $L\_CONT\_T$), and the Type-Token Ratio of lemmas, all showing significant Information Gain values.<br /><br />5. These features act as indicators of compromise, revealing when text has been deliberately altered to mask authorship and potentially alerting defenders to adversarial stylometric attacks, though detection often depends on comparing original and altered texts.<br /><br />6. Using these insights, the authors enhanced TraceTarnish by framing its operations around the five key features, improving the attack’s strength in anonymizing authorship.<br /><br />Overall, the work emphasizes how attempts to erase stylistic traces may inadvertently create detectable signals, advancing the understanding and effectiveness of adversarial stylometry methods. <div>

Abstract: In this study, we more rigorously evaluated our attack script $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, which leverages adversarial stylometry principles to anonymize the authorship of text-based messages. To ensure the efficacy and utility of our attack, we sourced, processed, and analyzed Reddit comments--comments that were later alchemized into $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data--to gain valuable insights. The transformed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data was then further augmented by $\textit{StyloMetrix}$ to manufacture stylometric features--features that were culled using the Information Gain criterion, leaving only the most informative, predictive, and discriminative ones. Our results found that function words and function word types ($L\_FUNC\_A$ $\&$ $L\_FUNC\_T$); content words and content word types ($L\_CONT\_A$ $\&$ $L\_CONT\_T$); and the Type-Token Ratio ($ST\_TYPE\_TOKEN\_RATIO\_LEMMAS$) yielded significant Information-Gain readings. The identified stylometric cues--function-word frequencies, content-word distributions, and the Type-Token Ratio--serve as reliable indicators of compromise (IoCs), revealing when a text has been deliberately altered to mask its true author. Similarly, these features could function as forensic beacons, alerting defenders to the presence of an adversarial stylometry attack; granted, in the absence of the original message, this signal may go largely unnoticed, as it appears to depend on a pre- and post-transformation comparison. "In trying to erase a trace, you often imprint a larger one." Armed with this understanding, we framed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$'s operations and outputs around these five isolated features, using them to conceptualize and implement enhancements that further strengthen the attack.

<title>NAS-LoRA: Empowering Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Visual Foundation Models with Searchable Adaptation</title>

<div> Keywords: Segment Anything Model, Low-Rank Adaptation, Neural Architecture Search, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, visual foundation models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper addresses the challenge of adapting the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a powerful Transformer-based image segmentation model, to specialized downstream domains such as medical and agricultural imaging. Traditional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods help improve task-specific performance but often lack an inductive bias, as the SAM encoder inherently misses spatial priors within image patches, limiting semantically rich feature extraction. To overcome this, the authors propose NAS-LoRA, a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that inserts a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components within LoRA, enabling dynamic optimization of integrated prior knowledge during weight updates. Additionally, a stage-wise optimization strategy is introduced to balance the ViT encoder’s weight updates and architectural changes, which promotes gradual acquisition of high-level semantic understanding. Experimental results show that NAS-LoRA outperforms existing PEFT techniques by enhancing adaptation quality while simultaneously reducing training costs by 24.14% without impacting inference efficiency. This work highlights the promise of leveraging NAS to improve the adaptability and efficiency of visual foundation models like SAM for domain-specific tasks. <div>

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful visual foundation model for image segmentation. However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal document retrieval, multilingual, cross-lingual alignment, vision-language models, contrastive training<br /><br />Summary: Multimodal document retrieval systems have advanced in aligning visual and textual information for semantic search but remain predominantly focused on English, limiting their use in multilingual environments. This paper introduces M3DR (Multilingual Multimodal Document Retrieval), a new framework designed to extend effective document retrieval across diverse languages and scripts. M3DR employs synthetic multilingual document data and is compatible with various vision-language architectures and model sizes, ensuring flexible, robust cross-lingual and cross-modal alignment. The framework uses contrastive training to produce unified representations for text and document images that generalize across 22 typologically diverse languages, demonstrating strong adaptability across linguistic and cultural variations. Additionally, the authors present a novel benchmark that simulates realistic multilingual settings and evaluates models in monolingual, multilingual, and mixed-language scenarios. M3DR supports both single dense vector retrieval and token-level multi-vector retrieval paradigms, exemplified by their models NetraEmbed and ColNetraEmbed. These models achieve state-of-the-art performance, showing approximately 150% relative improvement in cross-lingual retrieval tasks, highlighting the effectiveness and broad applicability of the approach. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal document retrieval systems have shown strong progress in aligning visual and textual content for semantic search. However, most existing approaches remain heavily English-centric, limiting their effectiveness in multilingual contexts. In this work, we present M3DR (Multilingual Multimodal Document Retrieval), a framework designed to bridge this gap across languages, enabling applicability across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. M3DR leverages synthetic multilingual document data and generalizes across different vision-language architectures and model sizes, enabling robust cross-lingual and cross-modal alignment. Using contrastive training, our models learn unified representations for text and document images that transfer effectively across languages. We validate this capability on 22 typologically diverse languages, demonstrating consistent performance and adaptability across linguistic and script variations. We further introduce a comprehensive benchmark that captures real-world multilingual scenarios, evaluating models under monolingual, multilingual, and mixed-language settings. M3DR generalizes across both single dense vector and ColBERT-style token-level multi-vector retrieval paradigms. Our models, NetraEmbed and ColNetraEmbed achieve state-of-the-art performance with ~150% relative improvements on cross-lingual retrieval.

<div> Keywords: Visual-Language Models, cartographic maps, question-answering, geospatial reasoning, CartoMapQA<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper introduces CartoMapQA, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate Visual-Language Models' (LVLMs) ability to interpret cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset contains over 2000 samples, each consisting of a map, a question (either open-ended or multiple-choice), and a corresponding ground-truth answer. The tasks cover various map interpretation skills ranging from low-level symbol recognition to mid-level information extraction and high-level geospatial reasoning such as route-based decision-making and scale interpretation. Evaluations of open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveal significant challenges, including difficulty understanding map-specific semantic information, limited geospatial reasoning capabilities, and frequent OCR-related errors when reading text embedded in maps. By highlighting these weaknesses, CartoMapQA serves as a valuable resource for identifying gaps in current LVLM architectures. The benchmark aims to guide future model improvements toward more reliable and robust map understanding. This progress has practical implications for real-world applications relying on accurate map interpretation, including navigation, geographic search, and urban planning. The authors have made the dataset and source code openly accessible to support community-driven research and development at the provided GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: The rise of Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) has unlocked new possibilities for seamlessly integrating visual and textual information. However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

<div> Fingerprinting, Intellectual Property, Large Language Models, Weight-based, Robustness

<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses the critical challenge of protecting Intellectual Property (IP) in Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights the limitations of existing fingerprinting techniques that rely on behavioral or structural methods which are vulnerable to false claim attacks and weight manipulation. To overcome these issues, the authors propose SELF, a novel intrinsic weight-based fingerprinting scheme that does not depend on input data and inherently resists false claims. SELF introduces two key innovations: first, it extracts unique, scalable, and transformation-invariant fingerprints using singular value and eigenvalue decomposition of attention weights within LLMs; second, it utilizes a neural network-based fingerprint similarity comparison method based on few-shot learning combined with data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that SELF achieves high accuracy in detecting IP infringement and maintains strong robustness against various post-training modifications such as quantization, pruning, and fine-tuning attacks. The approach thus provides an effective and reliable mechanism to safeguard LLM IP. The authors also provide their code publicly, allowing the community to reproduce and build upon their work. <div>

Abstract: The protection of Intellectual Property (IP) in Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a critical challenge in contemporary AI research. While fingerprinting techniques have emerged as a fundamental mechanism for detecting unauthorized model usage, existing methods -- whether behavior-based or structural -- suffer from vulnerabilities such as false claim attacks or susceptible to weight manipulations. To overcome these limitations, we propose SELF, a novel intrinsic weight-based fingerprinting scheme that eliminates dependency on input and inherently resists false claims. SELF achieves robust IP protection through two key innovations: 1) unique, scalable and transformation-invariant fingerprint extraction via singular value and eigenvalue decomposition of LLM attention weights, and 2) effective neural network-based fingerprint similarity comparison based on few-shot learning and data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate SELF maintains high IP infringement detection accuracy while showing strong robustness against various downstream modifications, including quantization, pruning, and fine-tuning attacks.

Abstract: DeepSeek-OCR demonstrates that rendered text can be reconstructed with high fidelity from a small number of vision tokens. This finding has sparked excitement about vision-based context compression for language models. But the evaluation stops at reconstruction; whether these representations help language modeling remains untested. We test two assumptions implicit in the optical-compression narrative: that vision-based compression provides unique advantages for text reconstruction from compressed representations, and that DeepSeek-OCR's reconstruction results are evidence that vision-based compression will be useful for language modeling. Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation. The excitement around optical context compression outpaces the evidence. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/ivnle/bad-autoencoding

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that think with images can interactively use tools to reason about visual inputs, but current approaches often rely on a narrow set of tools with limited real-world necessity and scalability. In this work, we first reveal a critical and previously overlooked weakness: even state-of-the-art MLLMs are surprisingly brittle, showing significant performance degradation on images with simple orientation changes or natural corruptions, underscoring the need for more robust tool-based reasoning. To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries. We train our model using a two-stage methodology, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a high-quality dataset curated for complex, multi-turn tool composition and error recovery, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel and dense process reward function to encourage strategic and efficient tool use. To facilitate this research, we construct new SFT and RL datasets and introduce a challenging new benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate robustness to orientation changes and multi-tool reasoning. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series show that our approach significantly improves model performance and fosters emergent capabilities such as flexible tool composition, efficient chained execution, and robust error recovery from runtime feedback.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in visual question answering tasks, but their reliance on large numbers of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods.

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the process of converting the complex input text into a real video. Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos. SLUL is trained using the newly developed Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss (SAGM Loss). Its performance has improved by 48.6% compared to the current SOTA generation methods.

Abstract: The need to assess LLMs for bias and fairness is critical, with current evaluations often being narrow, missing a broad categorical view. In this paper, we propose evaluating the bias and fairness of LLMs from a group fairness lens using a novel hierarchical schema characterizing diverse social groups. Specifically, we construct a dataset, GFAIR, encapsulating target-attribute combinations across multiple dimensions. Moreover, we introduce statement organization, a new open-ended text generation task, to uncover complex biases in LLMs. Extensive evaluations of popular LLMs reveal inherent safety concerns. To mitigate the biases of LLMs from a group fairness perspective, we pioneer a novel chainof-thought method GF-THINK to mitigate biases of LLMs from a group fairness perspective. Experimental results demonstrate its efficacy in mitigating bias and achieving fairness in LLMs. Our dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/surika/Group-Fairness-LLMs.

Abstract: Recently advancements in large multimodal models have led to significant strides in image comprehension capabilities. Despite these advancements, there is a lack of the robust benchmark specifically for assessing the Image-to-Web conversion proficiency of these large models. Primarily, it is essential to ensure the integrity of the web elements generated. These elements comprise visible and invisible categories. Previous evaluation methods (e.g.,BLEU) are notably susceptible to significant alterations due to the presence of invisible elements in Web. Furthermore, it is crucial to measure the layout information of web pages, referring to the positional relationships between elements, which is overlooked by previous work. To address challenges, we have curated and aligned a benchmark of images and corresponding web codes (IW-BENCH). Specifically, we propose the Element Accuracy, which tests the completeness of the elements by parsing the Document Object Model (DOM) tree. Layout Accuracy is also proposed to analyze the positional relationships of elements by converting DOM tree into a common subsequence. Besides, we design a five-hop multimodal Chain-of-Thought Prompting for better performance, which contains five hop: 1) SoM prompt injection. 2) Inferring Elements. 3) Inferring Layout. 4) Inferring Web code. 5) Reflection. Our benchmark comprises 1200 pairs of images and web codes with varying levels of difficulty. We have conducted extensive experiments on existing large multimodal models, offering insights into their performance and areas for improvement in image-to-web domain.

Abstract: We study continued training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a language model (LM) to make effective use of long-context information. We first establish a reliable evaluation protocol to guide model development -- instead of perplexity or simple needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) tests, we use a broad set of long-context downstream tasks, and we evaluate models after SFT as this better reveals long-context abilities. Supported by our robust evaluations, we run thorough experiments to decide the data mix for continued pre-training, the instruction tuning dataset, and many other design choices such as position extrapolation. We find that (1) code repositories and books are excellent sources of long data, but it is crucial to combine them with high-quality short-context data; (2) training with a sequence length beyond the evaluation length boosts long-context performance; (3) for SFT, using only short instruction datasets yields strong performance on long-context tasks. Our final model, ProLong-8B, which is initialized from Llama-3 and trained on 40B tokens, demonstrates state-of-the-art long-context performance among similarly sized models at a length of 128K. ProLong outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the majority of long-context tasks despite using only 5% as many tokens during long-context training. Additionally, ProLong can effectively process up to 512K tokens, one of the longest context windows of publicly available LMs.

<title>Uncertainty Quantification for LLMs through Minimum Bayes Risk: Bridging Confidence and Consistency</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) encompass a variety of approaches, with two major types being particularly prominent: information-based, which focus on model confidence expressed as token probabilities, and consistency-based, which assess the semantic relationship between multiple outputs generated using repeated sampling. Several recent methods have combined these two approaches to boost UQ performance. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our work discusses the fundamental approach to constructing uncertainty measures that directly links uncertainty with the minimum Bayes risks achieved by LLM decoding. Building on these findings, we propose a novel approach to integrating model confidence with output consistency, resulting in a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency, leading to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across various tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how small language models (SLMs) can be scaled to support multimodal search and recommendation use cases while remaining efficient enough for real-time, resource-constrained deployments. We present a framework that combines upside-down reinforcement learning with synthetic data distillation from a large language model (Llama-3) to train a 100M-parameter GPT-2 model for multitask prompt generation. Despite being up to 80 times smaller than state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), our SLM achieves relevance and diversity scores within 6% of competitive baselines such as Llama-3 8B, Qwen3 8B, and Ministral 8B. These results demonstrate that SLMs can effectively handle multimodal search and recommendation tasks, while dramatically reducing inference latency and memory overhead. Our study highlights the potential of lightweight models as practical engines for scalable multimodal discovery, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world multimodal applications such as media recommendations and creative content generation.

Abstract: In Transformer language models, activation vectors transform from current token embeddings to next token predictions as they pass through the model. To isolate a minimal form of this transformation, we identify language model subnetworks that make bigram predictions, naive next token predictions based only on the current token. We find that bigram subnetworks can be found in fully trained language models up to 1B parameters, and these subnetworks are critical for model performance even when they consist of less than 0.2% of model parameters. Bigram subnetworks are concentrated in the first Transformer MLP layer, and they overlap significantly with subnetworks trained to optimally prune a given model. Mechanistically, the bigram subnetworks often recreate a pattern from the full models where the first layer induces a sharp change that aligns activations with next token predictions rather than current token representations. Our results demonstrate that bigram subnetworks comprise a minimal subset of parameters that are both necessary and sufficient for basic next token predictions in language models, and they help drive the transformation from current to next token activations in the residual stream. These subnetworks can lay a foundation for studying more complex language model circuits by building up from a minimal circuit.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to improve factuality in large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in retrieved documents. However, ensuring perfect retrieval of relevant information remains challenging, and when irrelevant content is passed downstream to an LLM, it can lead to hallucinations. In this work, we propose Finetune-RAG, a simple and effective fine-tuning approach that features the first-of-its-kind RAG training dataset constructed to mimic real-world imperfections. Experimental results show that Finetune-RAG improves factual accuracy by 21.2% over the base model. We also propose Bench-RAG, an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation pipeline that stress tests models under realistic imperfect retrieval scenarios. Our codebase and dataset are fully open sourced for community use.

<title>Planning without Search: Refining Frontier LLMs with Offline Goal-Conditioned RL</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning. Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle, but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue, demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

<title>Proximalized Preference Optimization for Diverse Feedback Types: A Decomposed Perspective on DPO</title>

Abstract: Direct alignment methods typically train large language models (LLMs) by contrasting the likelihoods of preferred and dispreferred responses. While effective at capturing relative preferences, these methods are widely observed to suppress the absolute likelihoods of example responses. As a result, aligned models can deviate from expected patterns, exhibiting rewar-hacking effect even without an explicit reward model. This fundamental limitation of contrastive alignment, which we term likelihood underdetermination, motivates us to revisit direct preference optimization (DPO) -- the seminal direct alignment method. Interestingly, we show that the DPO loss admits a principled decomposition. The reformulated loss not only extends naturally to a broader range of feedback types, but also unveils the root cause of likelihood underdetermination. Specifically, we identify that standard DPO implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated loss; restoring this full term effectively resolves the underdetermination. Building on these insights, we introduce PRoximalized PReference Optimization (PRO), a unified alignment method that accommodates diverse feedback types while eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient approximation of the full regularizer. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the consistent superiority of PRO over existing methods across pairwise, binary and scalar feedback.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) have achieved widespread empirical success, but their theoretical expressive power remains only partially understood. In this work, we analyze a restricted idealization of fixed-precision transformers with strict future masking, soft attention, and no positional encodings. We establish that this class of models is exactly as expressive as a specific fragment of linear temporal logic that contains only a single temporal operator: the past operator. We further connect this fragment to established classes in formal language theory, automata theory, and algebra, yielding a unified framework for understanding transformer expressivity under this idealization. Finally, we present empirical results that align closely with our theory: transformers trained on languages within their characterized expressive capacity generalize reliably across sequence lengths, while they consistently fail to generalize on languages beyond it.

Abstract: Current LLMs are trained to refuse potentially harmful input queries regardless of whether users actually had harmful intents, causing a tradeoff between safety and user experience. Through a study of 480 participants evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs, we examine how different refusal strategies affect user perceptions across varying motivations. Our findings reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user motivation has negligible impact. Partial compliance -- providing general information without actionable details -- emerges as the optimal strategy, reducing negative user perceptions by over 50% to flat-out refusals. Complementing this, we analyze response patterns of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs and evaluate how 6 reward models score different refusal strategies, demonstrating that models rarely deploy partial compliance naturally and reward models currently undervalue it. This work demonstrates that effective guardrails require focusing on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than detecting intent, offering a path toward AI safety mechanisms that ensure both safety and sustained user engagement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective, showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context, requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning. MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation for continual learning and personalized modeling.

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge. RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs, thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1), the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2), the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance. To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and privacy-robustness.

However, their evaluation has been predominantly confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting different trends across models and languages.

Abstract: Large language models in healthcare often miss critical emotional cues, delivering medically sound but emotionally flat advice. Such responses are insufficient in clinical encounters, where distressed or vulnerable patients rely on empathic communication to support safety, adherence, and trust. We present RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce), an inference-time framework that guides models through structured emotional reasoning without retraining. RECAP decomposes patient input into appraisal-theoretic stages, identifies psychological factors, and assigns Likert-based emotion likelihoods that clinicians can inspect or override, producing nuanced and auditable responses. Across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench, RECAP improves emotional reasoning by 22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines. In blinded evaluations, oncology clinicians rated RECAP's responses as more empathetic, supportive, and context-appropriate than prompting baselines. These findings demonstrate that modular, principled prompting can enhance emotional intelligence in medical AI while maintaining transparency and accountability for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for educational support, yet their response quality varies depending on the language of interaction. This paper presents an automated multilingual pipeline for generating, solving, and evaluating math problems aligned with the German K-10 curriculum. We generated 628 math exercises and translated them into English, German, and Arabic. Three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen-plus) were prompted to produce step-by-step solutions in each language. A held-out panel of LLM judges, including Claude 3.5 Haiku, evaluated solution quality using a comparative framework. Results show a consistent gap, with English solutions consistently rated highest, and Arabic often ranked lower. These findings highlight persistent linguistic bias and the need for more equitable multilingual AI systems in education.

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by 3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support multilingual understanding and generation. Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy. Overall, our work enhances both the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of MHA.

Abstract: Million-level token inputs in long-context tasks pose significant computational and memory challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields. Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at https://github.com/liufanfanlff/C3-Context-Cascade-Compression

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation. However, existing scaling methods have key limitations: parallel methods like repeated sampling are often inefficient and quickly saturate, while sequential methods like SELF-REFINE struggle to improve after a few rounds. Although combining these approaches shows promise, current methods require fine-tuned reward and revision models. This paper proposes Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a simple yet effective approach that overcomes these limitations by strategically combining parallel and sequential techniques and fully leveraging LLMs' self-improvement abilities. SETS exploits the inherent self-verification and self-correction capabilities of LLMs, unifying sampling, verification, and correction within a single framework. This facilitates efficient and scalable test-time computation for enhanced performance on complex tasks without any model training. Our comprehensive experimental results on challenging benchmarks spanning planning, reasoning, math, and coding demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more advantageous test-time scaling behavior than the alternatives.

Abstract: While rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) are reshaping data-driven intelligent education, accurately simulating students remains an important but challenging bottleneck for scalable educational data collection, evaluation, and intervention design. However, current works are limited by scarce real interaction data, costly expert evaluation for realism, and a lack of large-scale, systematic analyses of LLMs ability in simulating students. We address this gap by presenting a three-stage LLM-human collaborative pipeline to automatically generate and filter high-quality student agents. We leverage a two-round automated scoring validated by human experts and deploy a score propagation module to obtain more consistent scores across the student similarity graph. Experiments show that combining automated scoring, expert calibration, and graph-based propagation yields simulated student that more closely track authentication by human judgments. We then analyze which profiles and behaviors are simulated more faithfully, supporting subsequent studies on personalized learning and educational assessment.

Abstract: LLM routing aims to select the most appropriate model for each query, balancing competing performance metrics such as accuracy and cost across a pool of language models. Prior approaches typically adopt a decoupled strategy, where the metrics are first predicted and the model is then selected based on these estimates. This setup is prone to compounding errors and often relies on full-feedback data, where each query is evaluated by all candidate models, which is costly to obtain and maintain in practice. In contrast, we learn from observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence. We further extend our framework to handle heterogeneous cost preferences via an interval-conditioned architecture. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance across different embedding models.

Abstract: Recent efficient sequence modeling methods such as Gated DeltaNet, TTT, and RWKV-7 have achieved performance improvements by supervising the recurrent memory management through Delta learning rule. Unlike previous state-space models (e.g., Mamba) and gated linear attentions (e.g., GLA), these models introduce interactions between the recurrent state and the key vector, structurally resembling bilinear systems. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Bilinear RNNs with a comprehensive analysis on the advantages and limitations of these models. Then, based on closed-loop control theory, we propose a novel Bilinear RNN variant named Comba, which adopts a scalar-plus-low-rank state transition, with both state feedback and output feedback corrections. We also implement a hardware-efficient chunk-wise parallel kernel in Triton and train models with 340M/1.3B parameters on large-scale corpus. Comba demonstrates superior performance and computation efficiency in both language and vision modeling.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a promising policy-based approach for Large Language Model alignment, yet its performance is often limited by training instability and suboptimal convergence. In this paper, we identify and analyze two main GRPO issues: (i) the token-level penalization, where valuable tokens shared across different responses receive contradictory feedback signals, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their likelihood; and (ii) the policy collapse, where negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, destabilizing training process. To address these issues we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which prevents conflicting gradients on valuable tokens by skipping negative updates while amplifying positive ones and filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold, to prevent policy collapse. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, as validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH, AIME 2024, AIME 2025 and AMC 2023.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations (Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.

Abstract: GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning. Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra, specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of 1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations, optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel optimization. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/Astra.

Abstract: In this work, we give a new completion of Chen's windowed-QFT lattice algorithm~\citep{chen2024quantum}. This extra step, called Step~$9^\dagger$, replaces the domain extension stage in Steps~8--9. The published Step~9 calls an amplitude periodicity lemma, yet its hypotheses break in the presence of affine offsets $\boldsymbol{v}^*$. Our analysis finds a basic conflict between two design constraints. The lattice problem asks for high spectral resolution, so the method prefers wide time windows. The quadratic phase error of the state prefers narrow time windows. Assumption~A5 packages the spectral concentration and near-uniformity properties that we require from the front end. Under~A5, a direct $\mathbb{Z}_M^n$ Fourier transform of the chirp-corrected coordinate state produces samples $\boldsymbol{u}$ that satisfy $\langle \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{u} \rangle \equiv 0 \pmod{Q}$ with probability $1-\mathrm{negl}(n)$ and are nearly uniform on the dual hyperplane $\{\boldsymbol{u} : \langle \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{u} \rangle \equiv 0 \pmod{Q}\}$. The new procedure does not require internal access to control wires. It uses the normalization $b_1=-1$ to apply a center-referenced phase correction directly on the first coordinate register. The scaling parameter $D$ ensures that this physical operation can be implemented by arithmetic on $X_1$ alone and does not read the hidden loop index. For Chen's complex-Gaussian Karst-wave window, we isolate a parameter regime, formalized in Assumption~A5, in which a polynomial retuning of the parameters gives a one-dimensional envelope for the loop index with width $\sigma_J \asymp Q\log n$.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully on-policy data.

<title>LLMs Position Themselves as More Rational Than Humans: Emergence of AI Self-Awareness Measured Through Game Theory</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow in capability, do they develop self-awareness as an emergent behavior? And if so, can we measure it? We introduce the AI Self-Awareness Index (AISAI), a game-theoretic framework for measuring self-awareness through strategic differentiation. Using the "Guess 2/3 of Average" game, we test 28 models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) across 4,200 trials with three opponent framings: (A) against humans, (B) against other AI models, and (C) against AI models like you. We operationalize self-awareness as the capacity to differentiate strategic reasoning based on opponent type. Finding 1: Self-awareness emerges with model advancement. The majority of advanced models (21/28, 75%) demonstrate clear self-awareness, while older/smaller models show no differentiation. Finding 2: Self-aware models rank themselves as most rational. Among the 21 models with self-awareness, a consistent rationality hierarchy emerges: Self > Other AIs > Humans, with large AI attribution effects and moderate self-preferencing. These findings reveal that self-awareness is an emergent capability of advanced LLMs, and that self-aware models systematically perceive themselves as more rational than humans. This has implications for AI alignment, human-AI collaboration, and understanding AI beliefs about human capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated their integration into clinical decision support, particularly in prescription review. To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text generators into powerful problem solvers. Yet, many open tasks demand critical thinking, multi-source, and verifiable outputs, which are beyond single-shot prompting or standard retrieval-augmented generation. Recently, numerous studies have explored Deep Research (DR), which aims to combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with external tools, such as search engines, thereby empowering LLMs to act as research agents capable of completing complex, open-ended tasks. This survey presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of deep research systems, including a clear roadmap, foundational components, practical implementation techniques, important challenges, and future directions. Specifically, our main contributions are as follows: (i) we formalize a three-stage roadmap and distinguish deep research from related paradigms; (ii) we introduce four key components: query planning, information acquisition, memory management, and answer generation, each paired with fine-grained sub-taxonomies; (iii) we summarize optimization techniques, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning; and (iv) we consolidate evaluation criteria and open challenges, aiming to guide and facilitate future development. As the field of deep research continues to evolve rapidly, we are committed to continuously updating this survey to reflect the latest progress in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become one of the most transformative tools across many applications, as they have significantly boosted productivity and achieved impressive results in various domains such as finance, healthcare, education, telecommunications, and law, among others. Typically, state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models are developed by large corporations based on large data collections and substantial computational and financial resources required to pretrain such models from scratch. These foundation models then serve as the basis for further development and domain adaptation for specific use cases or tasks. However, given the dynamic and fast-paced nature of launching new foundation models, the process of selecting the most suitable model for a particular use case, application, or domain becomes increasingly complex. We argue that there are two main dimensions that need to be taken into consideration when selecting a model for further training: a qualitative dimension (which model is best suited for a task based on information, for instance, taken from model cards) and a quantitative dimension (which is the best performing model). The quantitative performance of models is assessed through leaderboards, which rank models based on standardized benchmarks and provide a consistent framework for comparing different LLMs. In this work, we address the analysis of the quantitative dimension by exploring the current leaderboards and benchmarks. To illustrate this analysis, we focus on the medical domain as a case study, demonstrating the evolution, current landscape, and practical significance of this quantitative evaluation dimension. Finally, we propose a Model Selection Methodology (MSM), a systematic approach designed to guide the navigation, prioritization, and selection of the model that best aligns with a given use case.

<div> Diffusion Language Models, inference, trajectory rectification, mutual information, adaptive sampling<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses limitations in existing inference methods for Diffusion Language Models (DLMs), which typically depend on local step-based metrics such as confidence or entropy, leading to inconsistent and suboptimal generation sequences. To improve this, the authors propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), an innovative inference framework. CCD introduces a trajectory rectification mechanism that incorporates historical context to enhance the coherence of generated sequences by enabling early rejection of less promising paths. The authors theoretically frame this mechanism as modeling consistency via the conditional mutual information between the past context and token predictions. Furthermore, they tackle inefficiencies in uniform decoding budgets by presenting an adaptive sampling method that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget at each step based on the consistency metric, rather than following a fixed diffusion-step allocation. This dual approach leads to both faster and higher-quality generation. Empirical evaluation on benchmarks such as Dream and LLaDA shows that CCD achieves up to a 3.48x speedup combined with a 3.91% improvement in generation performance, making it a significant advancement in improving both the speed and quality of DLM inference processes. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved significant success due to their any-order generation capabilities. However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, reversible architectures, memory efficiency, fine-tuning, backpropagation<br /><br />Summary:  
This work addresses the high memory and computational costs associated with training and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, which use time-reversible dynamics during backpropagation to retrieve hidden states instead of storing all intermediate activations. This novel approach significantly reduces memory consumption, enabling the use of larger batch sizes and improving throughput under the same memory constraints. Additionally, the paper proposes an efficient method to convert existing non-reversible pre-trained LLMs into these reversible architectures through fine-tuning, making the approach practical and compatible with foundation models already in use. Empirical results demonstrate that the reversible models achieve comparable or better performance across multiple datasets and benchmarks. Overall, this methodology presents a scalable and effective pathway to reduce resource demands for both LLM training from scratch and fine-tuning, potentially facilitating more accessible and efficient LLM development. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.

<div> Dialect Identification, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning, Whisper model, Mandarin subdialects<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Dialect Identification (DI) involves recognizing different dialects within the same language using speech signals and can enhance performance in downstream speech tasks even when speakers have strong dialectal variations. However, fine-tuning speech models for DI is computationally expensive and demands high memory resources. Recent approaches have employed Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods to reduce the number of trainable parameters, yielding improved parameter efficiency but only limited gains in memory efficiency and training speed. To overcome these limitations, this study investigates Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, initially developed for language tasks, and applies them to general-purpose pre-trained speech models. The research comprehensively evaluates various MEFT methods in terms of GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed. As a practical demonstration, the authors fine-tune the Whisper model to classify six Mandarin subdialects using the KeSpeech dataset. The MEFT methods achieve substantial resource savings, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1. Importantly, these improvements come without sacrificing classification accuracy, as the results are comparable to both vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT approaches, demonstrating MEFT’s potential for efficient and effective speech model adaptation. <div>

Abstract: Dialect Identification (DI) is a task to recognize different dialects within the same language from a speech signal. DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

<div> abusive speech, hate speech classification, BERT fine-tuning, TF IDF sample selection, domain-specific tokenizer  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting abusive speech on social media, which is complicated by the frequent introduction of new slang and obfuscated terms aimed at evading automated detection. To improve hate speech classification while reducing training requirements, the authors propose a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy for BERT. The method involves using a TF IDF-based sample selection technique that retains only the top 75% most informative examples from the training data, thereby limiting data size without sacrificing model performance. Additionally, the study enhances BERT’s tokenizer by incorporating domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly used in abusive language, overcoming vocabulary limitations of the base model. Experiments carried out on a standard hate speech dataset indicate that this approach yields competitive classification accuracy. Moreover, the reduction in training data and vocabulary adaptation significantly improves computational efficiency, making the solution well-suited for scalable and adaptable abusive content moderation systems. The findings highlight the utility of sample selection and tokenizer augmentation as practical tools in evolving hate speech detection frameworks. <div>

Abstract: Abusive speech on social media poses a persistent and evolving challenge, driven by the continuous emergence of novel slang and obfuscated terms designed to circumvent detection systems. In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.

<div> Reasoning LLMs, pruning, self-generated calibration, structured pruning, sparsity

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of pruning Reasoning Large Language Models (RLMs) like OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3, which are typically large and compute-intensive due to multi-step chain-of-thought reasoning. Existing pruning methods dramatically degrade the performance of RLMs even at moderate sparsity levels (e.g., 20%), causing accuracy collapse and loss of reasoning coherence. The authors analyze this failure and identify a crucial mismatch between calibration data, pruning objectives, and the model’s decode-time reasoning process as the root cause. They find that relying on the model’s own self-generated reasoning traces for calibration provides a more reliable signal than human-labeled data, better reflecting the inference distribution. To resolve this, the paper introduces RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning with reasoning dynamics by using self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration to preserve calibration fidelity during pruning. Evaluations on Qwen3-8B using GSM8K and MathQA benchmarks demonstrate that RESP significantly outperforms existing pruning methods, maintaining near-dense model accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and reducing performance degradation at higher sparsity. At 40% sparsity, RESP achieves 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing previous best methods by large margins of 66.87% and 47%, respectively. <div>

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs (RLMs) such as OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3 deliver strong multi-step reasoning through chain-of-thought generation, but their large model sizes and lengthy decode-time outputs make them costly to deploy and unsuitable for resource-constrained settings. To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.

<div> Keywords: MODOMA system, language acquisition, multi-agent environment, grammatical categories, language models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces the MODOMA system, a computational multi-agent laboratory environment designed for unsupervised language acquisition experiments. The system simulates the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent, to facilitate language learning. It combines statistical and rule-based procedures, resulting in a knowledge-based language model that can generate and parse new utterances in the target language. MODOMA is fully parametrized, allowing researchers to control all aspects of the experimental setup and explicitly consult the acquired grammatical knowledge. The paper presents experiments demonstrating that both functional and content grammatical categories can be acquired by the child agent from training and test data generated by the adult agent, with varying amounts of exemplars. Importantly, the patterns observed in the machine-generated data align with well-established patterns found in human-generated language data. These findings validate the MODOMA approach as a viable model for studying language acquisition, showing successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent. Overall, this system offers novel opportunities for conducting computational experiments on language acquisition, bridging statistical learning with explicit grammar representation. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

<div> Large language models, Reinforcement learning, Latent reasoning, Token sampling, Computational efficiency  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper introduces LiteReason, a novel method designed to enhance latent reasoning in large language models (LLMs) while reducing computational overhead. 1) LLMs generate long reasoning chains or "reasoning traces" to tackle complex tasks, which can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) for better answer prediction but at high computational costs. 2) LiteReason integrates a lightweight Reasoning Projector module that produces continuous latent tokens, enabling the model to 'skip' certain reasoning steps and thus reduce the token processing burden. 3) The policy model trained with RL dynamically switches between conventional discrete reasoning and latent reasoning via the projector, balancing computational efficiency and reasoning accuracy. 4) Experimental evaluation on tasks like plot hole detection and book chapter generation demonstrates that LiteReason outperforms previous latent reasoning baselines and approaches the performance of non-latent RL methods. 5) Notably, LiteReason reduces the final reasoning length by 77-92%, achieving a more efficient tradeoff between model performance and compute cost, suggesting a promising direction for scaling LLM reasoning capabilities with manageable resource use. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tackle complex tasks by generating long chains of thought or "reasoning traces" that act as latent variables in the generation of an output given a query. A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.

<div> Keywords: prompt design, prompt specificity, large language models, reasoning performance, adaptive prompting<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the underexplored impact of prompt specificity—how detailed or vague a prompt is—on the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors introduce DETAIL, a novel evaluation framework that measures LLM performance across different specificity levels. Using GPT-4, they generate multi-level prompts and quantify their specificity through perplexity scores. Correctness is assessed via GPT-based semantic equivalence metrics to ensure nuanced understanding beyond simple keyword matching. The study spans 30 newly proposed reasoning tasks and compares two models, GPT-4 and a smaller model, O3-mini. Results demonstrate that higher prompt specificity significantly boosts accuracy, especially in smaller models and tasks that are procedural in nature. This suggests that smaller or less capable models benefit more from carefully detailed prompts. The findings underline the importance of adaptive prompting strategies tailored to model and task characteristics. Finally, the work contributes useful tools and a dataset to facilitate further research on the relationship between prompt design and LLM reasoning performance, encouraging development of more effective human-AI interaction techniques. <div>

Abstract: Climate adaptation strategies are proposed in response to climate change. They are practised in agriculture to sustain food production. These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Using a previously reported dataset of expert-curated question-answers, we show that CAIRNS outperforms the baselines on most of the metrics. Our thorough ablation study confirms the results on all metrics. To validate our LLM-based evaluation, we also report an analysis of correlations against human judgment.

<div> Keywords: language models, contextual reasoning, biomedical QA, conflicting contexts, HealthContradict<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper investigates how language models utilize contextual information to answer health-related questions, particularly when faced with conflicting biomedical contexts. The authors introduce HealthContradict, a novel expert-verified dataset containing 920 unique instances. Each instance pairs a health question with a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, alongside two documents presenting contradictory viewpoints. The study evaluates the impact of different prompt conditions—correct, incorrect, or contradictory contexts—on language model outputs. HealthContradict provides a more nuanced evaluation of a model's ability to reason over conflicting biomedical information compared to previous medical question-answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned biomedical language models not only encode parametric knowledge from pretraining but also effectively leverage correct contextual information while resisting misleading or incorrect contexts. This dual capability underlines the importance of contextual reasoning in enhancing the reliability and accuracy of language models in biomedical applications. Overall, the work emphasizes the critical role of contextual understanding for trustworthy health question answering using language models. <div>

Abstract: How do language models use contextual information to answer health questions? How are their responses impacted by conflicting contexts? We assess the ability of language models to reason over long, conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, an expert-verified dataset comprising 920 unique instances, each consisting of a health-related question, a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, and two documents presenting contradictory stances. We consider several prompt settings, including correct, incorrect or contradictory context, and measure their impact on model outputs. Compared to existing medical question-answering evaluation benchmarks, HealthContradict provides greater distinctions of language models' contextual reasoning capabilities. Our experiments show that the strength of fine-tuned biomedical language models lies not only in their parametric knowledge from pretraining, but also in their ability to exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates the interactions between large language models (LLMs) acting as problem solvers and verifiers, focusing on how verifiers select high-quality answers from candidate solutions. Unlike prior works that primarily examine self-verification within a single model, this study systematically explores verification both within the same model family and across different families. It evaluates 37 diverse LLMs spanning various sizes, families, and training stages (base vs. post-trained) across 9 benchmarks that include logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. The researchers introduce "verifier gain," a novel metric that estimates performance improvements achievable by verifier-based rejection sampling during test time, and validate it empirically. They analyze important scaling behaviors, including how verifier gain and false positive rates evolve with model size and post-training. Their results highlight that cross-family verification considerably enhances performance compared to self-verification. Furthermore, post-training tends to diminish self-verification gains but amplifies improvements when verifying outputs across different model families. Finally, tasks involving mathematics and logical reasoning emerge as inherently more verifiable than others, suggesting certain domains are better suited for verifier-based performance boosts. <div>
arXiv:2512.02304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.

<div> Keywords: natural language generation, story generation, human-computer interaction, large language models, TaleFrame<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper introduces TaleFrame, a novel system designed to enhance creative story generation by combining large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI). It addresses limitations in existing systems that struggle with fine-grained control and clear input specifications, which often results in stories that do not align well with user intent. TaleFrame decomposes story structure into four essential units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline, enabling precise control over the narrative generation process. The system utilizes the Tinystories dataset, transforming it into a preference dataset with 9,851 JSON entries to fine-tune a local Llama model via a JSON2Story approach, thereby converting structured data into coherent stories. An intuitive interface supports user interactions such as dragging, dropping, attaching, and connecting these units, facilitating user-driven story creation and editing. TaleFrame also incorporates an evaluation mechanism spanning seven dimensions such as creativity and structural integrity, offering suggestions for iterative story refinement. The authors conduct quantitative evaluations and user studies that validate TaleFrame's effectiveness and user satisfaction. Additionally, the processed dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face, supporting further research and development in controlled story generation systems. <div>

Abstract: With the advancement of natural language generation (NLG) technologies, creative story generation systems have gained increasing attention. However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

<title>What Signals Really Matter for Misinformation Tasks? Evaluating Fake-News Detection and Virality Prediction under Real-World Constraints</title>

<div> fake-news detection, virality prediction, textual embeddings, numeric features, evaluation design<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This study evaluates two practical tasks in online misinformation: fake-news detection and virality prediction, emphasizing the need for rapid operational responses.<br /><br />2. The researchers use the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets to compare the effectiveness of textual embeddings (RoBERTa and Mistral) against lightweight numeric features such as timing, follower counts, verification status, and likes, employing sequence models including GRU, gating architectures, and Transformer encoders.<br /><br />3. Findings indicate that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable alternatives when language models are unavailable or computational resources are limited.<br /><br />4. Virality prediction is found to be substantially more challenging than fake-news detection, with results highly sensitive to how viral labels are defined; a median-based "viral" split (<50 likes) provides a pragmatic but conservative estimate, and time-censoring engagement features is desirable yet difficult due to API restrictions.<br /><br />5. Dimensionality-reduction analysis shows non-linear methods (t-SNE) outperform linear methods (PCA) for virality prediction, and swapping RoBERTa with Mistral embeddings produces only modest performance differences.<br /><br />6. The authors discuss the implications for evaluation design, highlight reproducibility constraints in the field, and provide code and data splits where possible, along with guidance on metric selection. <div>

Abstract: We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.

<div> Keywords: relevance modeling, e-commerce search, adversarial data synthesis, knowledge distillation, Chain-of-Thought LLM  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses challenges in relevance modeling for e-commerce search, specifically the limitations of traditional term-matching methods like BM25 and the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples for neural models. First, it introduces ADORE, a self-sustaining framework combining three innovative components to improve semantic understanding and model robustness. The first component is a Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, which employs a Chain-of-Thought large language model (LLM) to generate intent-aligned training data that is further refined using Kahneman-Tversky Optimization to better align with actual user behavior. Second, the framework includes an Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that automatically generates adversarial examples targeting different error types, thereby enhancing model robustness to hard cases. Third, ADORE incorporates a Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module, which infuses domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a lighter student model that is easier to deploy while retaining important reasoning capabilities. Together, these elements automate annotation, adversarial example generation, and knowledge distillation, effectively overcoming data scarcity and improving reasoning in relevance modeling. Extensive large-scale experiments and real-world online A/B tests demonstrate the framework’s superiority. Ultimately, ADORE establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient and cognitively aligned relevance modeling tailored for industrial e-commerce applications. <div>

Abstract: Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

<title>From Imitation to Discrimination: Toward A Generalized Curriculum Advantage Mechanism Enhancing Cross-Domain Reasoning Tasks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02580</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02580</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Reinforcement learning, Curriculum learning, Advantage signals, Mathematical reasoning, GUI reasoning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces CAPO (Curriculum Advantage Policy Optimization), a novel adaptive curriculum mechanism designed to improve reinforcement learning training of large language models. Traditional methods use both positive and negative advantage signals indiscriminately from early stages, which can cause ambiguous guidance and limit performance gains. CAPO addresses this by initially focusing only on positive advantage samples in a bootstrapped imitation learning phase, establishing robust foundational skills. After this foundation is set, negative advantage signals are gradually introduced to help the model develop discriminative abilities, enhancing its generalization to more complex reasoning tasks. The method is compatible with various optimization algorithms such as GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, showcasing versatility and ease of integration. Experimentally, CAPO demonstrates stable and significant performance improvements on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, confirming the efficacy of the curriculum approach. Moreover, the framework generalizes effectively beyond purely linguistic tasks, extending into multimodal scenarios like Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning, underscoring CAPO’s robustness and broad applicability in enhancing large language models’ reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. <div>
arXiv:2512.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a paradigm for post-training large language models, boosting their reasoning capabilities. Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework.

<div> Large language models, input order, primacy effect, Gemini 2.5 Flash, factual consistency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.5 Flash, weight input documents equally when summarizing multiple long texts. Using a dataset centered on abortion-related news, the researchers created 40 distinct article triplets representing pro, neutral, and con stances. Each triplet was reordered into six different input permutations and used to prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate neutral overviews. The generated summaries were evaluated for lexical overlap using ROUGE-L, semantic similarity using BERTScore, and factual consistency using SummaC. Statistical analyses, including one-way ANOVA, revealed a significant primacy effect specifically in semantic similarity (BERTScore), showing that summaries were more aligned with the first-presented article regardless of the stance. Pairwise comparisons confirmed that the summaries based on the first document significantly differed from those based on second and third positions, while no difference was found between the latter two positions. This finding demonstrates a selective bias or preference of LLMs toward the first input document when generating summaries. The authors highlight risks associated with such primacy bias for applications relying on LLM-generated overviews and agentic AI systems, where disproportionate influence of early-stage LLM outputs might affect downstream decisions and actions. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in settings such as Google's AI Overviews, where it summarizes multiple long documents. However, it remains unclear whether they weight all inputs equally. Focusing on abortion-related news, we construct 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permute each triplet into six input orders, and prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a neutral overview. We evaluate each summary against its source articles using ROUGE-L (lexical overlap), BERTScore (semantic similarity), and SummaC (factual consistency). One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article. Pairwise comparisons further show that Position 1 differs significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while the latter two do not differ from each other, confirming a selective preference for the first document. The findings present risks for applications that rely on LLM-generated overviews and for agentic AI systems, where the steps involving LLMs can disproportionately influence downstream actions.

<div> Bias mitigation, Large language models, Model merging, Debiasing algorithms, Performance trade-off  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper investigates the issue of social bias in large language models (LLMs), which can arise from biases embedded in their pre-training data and pose risks to fairness and trust. To mitigate these biases, the authors conduct an empirical survey comparing seven model merging algorithms—Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap—applied to 13 open-weight LLMs from the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. The evaluation employs three bias-focused datasets (BBQ, BOLD, HONEST) to assess bias reduction and measures downstream task performance via the SuperGLUE benchmark. The findings reveal a fundamental trade-off: approaches that achieve stronger bias mitigation tend to degrade accuracy, especially in tasks involving reading comprehension, commonsense, and causal reasoning. Among the methods studied, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while preserving overall model performance, with moderate SLERP interpolation weights offering the best balance between debiasing and utility. This work highlights that while model merging is a promising strategy for bias mitigation in LLMs, excessive debiasing or improper merging can impair linguistic capabilities critical for real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to inherit and even amplify societal biases present in their pre-training corpora, threatening fairness and social trust. To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.

<title>CREST: Universal Safety Guardrails Through Cluster-Guided Cross-Lingual Transfer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: content safety, large language models, low-resource languages, cross-lingual transfer, multilingual classification<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. The paper addresses the critical need for content safety mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) to ensure their safe deployment in real-world applications.<br />2. Current safety guardrails mostly focus on high-resource languages, neglecting many users who communicate in low-resource languages.<br />3. The authors propose CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model supporting 100 languages using only 0.5 billion parameters.<br />4. CREST is trained on a carefully selected subset of 13 high-resource languages and employs cluster-based cross-lingual transfer techniques to generalize effectively to both seen and unseen high- and low-resource languages.<br />5. This approach overcomes the challenge of limited training data in low-resource language settings.<br />6. Extensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks demonstrate that CREST outperforms state-of-the-art safety guardrails of similar scale and shows competitive performance against much larger models (2.5 billion parameters and above).<br />7. The study emphasizes the shortcomings of language-specific safety guardrails and advocates for developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems capable of scaling globally to support diverse populations. <div>
arXiv:2512.02711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

<title>Emergent Bayesian Behaviour and Optimal Cue Combination in LLMs</title>

<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02719</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: large language models, Bayesian integration, multimodal cue-combination, psychophysics, uncertainty handling<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) inherently employ near-optimal Bayesian strategies in multimodal integration tasks without explicit training. Inspired by psychophysics research on human perception, the authors develop BayesBench, a behavioral benchmark containing four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, duration) across textual and visual modalities. Nine diverse LLMs are evaluated alongside human judgments to calibrate results within controlled experiments involving noise, context, and instructional prompts. Beyond standard accuracy and efficiency metrics, a novel Bayesian Consistency Score is introduced to detect principled Bayesian behavioral patterns even when accuracy plateaus. Results reveal that some models show Bayesian-consistent adaptations, but high accuracy alone does not ensure robust cue integration, as exemplified by GPT-5 Mini achieving perfect text accuracy but failing in effective visual cue integration. This exposes a critical gap between raw capability and underlying computational strategies, warning against over-reliance on accuracy-centric benchmarks that may overlook fragile uncertainty handling. Findings highlight emergent abilities in uncertainty processing and establish a link between model accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. The authors release the BayesBench benchmark and consistency metric publicly, aiming to guide future multimodal architecture designs and evaluation approaches. <div>
arXiv:2512.02719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

<div> LLM-based survey systems, evaluation benchmark, SurveyEval, outline coherence, reference accuracy<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate automatically generated surveys produced by large language model (LLM)-based systems. The evaluation focuses on three key dimensions: overall quality of the generated surveys, coherence of the survey outlines, and accuracy of the references cited within the surveys. SurveyEval expands its assessment across seven different subject areas, ensuring broad applicability and robustness of the evaluation framework. To enhance the alignment between automated evaluation and human judgment, the authors augment the existing LLM-as-a-Judge framework by incorporating human reference annotations. The empirical results from using SurveyEval reveal a performance gap where general-purpose long-text or academic writing LLM systems tend to produce surveys of lower quality compared to specialized survey-generation models. These specialized systems demonstrate a significant improvement in generating coherent, high-quality, and well-referenced survey documents. Overall, SurveyEval serves as a scalable and versatile testbed that can guide future research and development in automatic survey generation by providing detailed insights into various aspects of survey quality across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria. The benchmark thus aims to advance the state of the art in automated information synthesis from web sources. <div>
arXiv:2512.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

<title>Towards Unification of Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification for Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02772</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Hallucination Detection, Fact Verification, UniFact, Hybrid Approaches<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations—content that is fluent yet factually incorrect—posing challenges for trust and real-world usage. Two research paradigms have emerged to tackle this: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). However, these paradigms have developed independently, with differing assumptions, datasets, and evaluation methods, creating a divide that limits progress. To bridge this gap, the authors introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that allows direct, instance-level comparison between HD and FV by dynamically generating LLM outputs alongside factuality labels. Extensive experiments conducted across various LLM families and detection techniques reveal three major conclusions: (1) neither HD nor FV alone is universally superior; (2) each method captures different and complementary aspects of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches combining both HD and FV consistently outperform standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-art results. Beyond benchmarking, the study provides an in-depth analysis of why these paradigms diverged and offers empirical support for their unification. The authors advocate for a new integrated research agenda aimed at unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification to enhance the reliability of LLM outputs. All related code, data, and baseline implementations have been open-sourced to facilitate further research. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations, generating content that appears fluent and coherent but is factually incorrect. Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.

<title>Making Dialogue Grounding Data Rich: A Three-Tier Data Synthesis Framework for Generalized Referring Expression Comprehension</title>

<div> Keywords: Dialogue-Based Referring Expressions, Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension, Data Synthesis, Coreference Resolution, Visual Grounding<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of Dialogue-Based Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension (GREC), which involves grounding referring expressions and identifying unlimited targets within complex visual scenes while resolving coreference throughout extended dialogue contexts. Current models face significant difficulties when there is a distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, a problem worsened by the limited availability of annotated dialogue grounding datasets. To overcome these issues, the authors propose a novel three-tier data-synthesis approach that strikes a balance between realism and controllability, enabling the generation of scalable and effective supervision data for dialogue-conditioned visual grounding tasks. By fine-tuning existing models on this synthesized dataset, the method consistently achieves substantial performance improvements over prior state-of-the-art approaches. Evaluations conducted using standard metrics confirm the robustness and generalizability of the synthesized training data. This work thus contributes a practical solution to the scarcity of annotated data while enhancing dialogue-based visual grounding capabilities, facilitating better understanding and grounding of referring expressions in dialogue systems operating in diverse and complex visual environments. <div>

Abstract: Dialogue-Based Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension (GREC) requires models to ground the expression and unlimited targets in complex visual scenes while resolving coreference across a long dialogue context. However, existing systems struggle under distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, a gap exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated dialogue grounding data. We address this challenge with a three-tier data-synthesis method that balances realism and controllability to produce scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding. Fine-tuning on the synthesized data yields consistent, substantial improvements over prior approaches across standard evaluation metrics.

<div> Keywords: Low-resource African languages, Sentiment analysis, TriLex framework, AfroXLMR, AfriBERTa  
  
<br /><br />Summary:  
This study addresses the underrepresentation of low-resource African languages in sentiment analysis, which impacts lexical coverage and multilingual NLP system performance. It introduces TriLex, a novel three-stage retrieval augmented framework that combines corpus-based extraction, cross-lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for these languages. Leveraging the enriched lexicon, two prominent African pretrained language models, AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa, are evaluated across multiple case studies. Results show AfroXLMR achieves superior performance, with F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu, and demonstrates strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa is not pretrained on the target languages, it still attains reliable F1-scores around 64%, highlighting its practical value in computationally limited environments. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further improve precision and robustness. The study concludes that TriLex is a scalable and effective solution for expanding multilingual sentiment lexicons and enhancing sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages. <div>

Abstract: Low-resource African languages remain underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting both lexical coverage and the performance of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages.

<div> Keywords: Stable Rank, Large Language Models, intrinsic quality signal, reinforcement learning, alignment without supervision  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences without relying on external supervision such as human annotations or reward models, which have inherent limitations like scarcity, subjectivity, and susceptibility to reward hacking. The authors introduce "stable rank," an intrinsic, annotation-free quality metric derived from the model's internal hidden state representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality by calculating the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, reflecting how information is distributed across representation dimensions as a proxy for quality. Empirically, stable rank achieves high accuracy (84.04%) on RewardBench and significantly improves task performance by an average of 11.3 percentage points when combined with Best-of-N sampling compared to greedy decoding. Building on this, the authors propose Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that uses stable rank as a reward signal, eliminating the need for external supervision. SR-GRPO notably boosts the performance of the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model by 10% on STEM tasks and 19% on mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing learned reward models and self-evaluation approaches. Overall, this work demonstrates that internal model geometry can provide effective, scalable quality signals for alignment without external annotations or supervision. <div>

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on external supervision, which faces critical limitations: human annotations are scarce and subjective, reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking, and self-evaluation methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and biases. In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.

<div> Large Language Models, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment, Benchmark, Reward Model  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain, focusing on their clinical application capabilities. TCM's individualized and holistic approach, especially in "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT), complicates such assessments. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on knowledge-based question-answering or syndrome differentiation accuracy, often overlooking treatment decision-making evaluation. To bridge this gap, the authors introduce TCM-BEST4SDT, a comprehensive clinical case-based benchmark developed with input from TCM experts. The benchmark covers four key tasks: TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. A novel reward model is designed to quantify how well prescriptions align with syndromes, enhancing evaluation depth. Data annotation is conducted through a rigorous pipeline to ensure quality and reliability. The evaluation framework incorporates three complementary mechanisms: selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The framework was validated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs across general and TCM-specific domains. Finally, TCM-BEST4SDT has been made publicly available to support ongoing advancements in intelligent TCM research. <div>

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.

<div> Keywords: multimodal translation, lecture localization, slide translation, speech synthesis, multilingual education<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper introduces BOOM, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion designed to translate lecture content across three synchronized modalities: text, slides, and speech. It addresses the challenge of localizing educational materials that are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slide content. BOOM’s end-to-end system jointly processes audio and visual inputs to produce translated text transcripts, localized slides that maintain original visual elements, and synthesized speech in the target language. The approach ensures accessibility and a comprehensive learning experience for students by preserving the integrity of all content modalities. Experimental results highlight the added benefits of incorporating slide-aware transcripts, which enhance the performance of downstream tasks like summarization and question answering. The authors also contribute to the community by releasing the Slide Translation code under the MIT License and integrating it into the Lecture Translator framework, facilitating further research and application development in multilingual education technology. This holistic approach reflects the increasing importance of education globalization and the rapid growth of online learning, where simultaneous multimodal translation is crucial for effective knowledge transfer across different languages and cultures. <div>

Abstract: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have made localizing educational content a critical challenge. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering. We release our Slide Translation code at https://github.com/saikoneru/image-translator and integrate it in Lecture Translator at https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/isl-ai4lt/lt-middleware/ltpipeline}\footnote{All released code and models are licensed under the MIT License.

<div> Keywords: prompt optimization, large language models, open-source framework, discrete optimizers, modular system<br /><br />Summary: Prompt optimization is essential for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on various tasks. Despite its demonstrated effectiveness in research, widespread practical use is limited due to implementations being embedded in unmaintained and isolated research codebases. To overcome these challenges, the authors present promptolution, an open-source framework that unifies all necessary components for prompt optimization in one extensible and modular system. This framework is designed to serve both practitioners and researchers by consolidating multiple state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods under a single platform. Importantly, promptolution remains agnostic to the specific LLM backend, enabling compatibility across different models without dependence on the underlying implementations. By providing a cohesive and maintainable environment, promptolution aims to facilitate easier experimentation, benchmarking, and application of prompt optimization techniques, promoting broader adoption and further advancement in this area. <div>

To address this, we introduce promptolution, a unified and modular open-source framework that provides all components required for prompt optimization within a single extensible system for both practitioners and researchers. It integrates multiple contemporary discrete prompt optimizers while remaining agnostic to the underlying LLM implementation.

<div> Keywords: system prompts, multilingual LLMs, prompt optimization, cross-lingual behavior, reasoning patterns<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper studies the role of system prompts in conditioning large language models (LLMs) for accurate and robust multilingual performance, expanding beyond English-only settings. The authors propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework specifically designed to assess system prompt effectiveness in multicultural and multilingual environments. Large-scale experiments are conducted across five languages, three different LLM architectures, and three established benchmarks. The research identifies certain prompt components—such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, emotional content, and scenario framing—that are strongly correlated with improved multilingual model robustness. Building on these insights, the paper introduces a prompt optimization framework tailored to multilingual settings, capable of automatically discovering prompts that enhance performance metrics by 5-10%. In an extensive analysis of over 10 million reasoning units, the study finds that better-performing system prompts foster more structured, consistent, and coherent reasoning patterns, while minimizing unnecessary language-switching within responses. Ultimately, the work emphasizes that system prompt optimization offers a scalable and effective approach to achieving accurate, reliable, and linguistically consistent cross-lingual behavior in large language models deployed in real-world multilingual applications. <div>

Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

<div> Keywords: Hate speech detection, Bangla language, Transformer models, Low-resource languages, Pre-trained language models<br /><br />Summary: Hate speech recognition for low-resource languages such as Bangla remains challenging due to limited datasets, orthographic variation, and linguistic diversity. Bangla, spoken by over 230 million people in Bangladesh and India, lacks sufficient computational resources despite increasing demand for automated social media moderation. The study focuses on Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection, reproducing official baseline methods including Majority, Random, and Support Vector Machine classifiers. Additional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree were also evaluated. Transformer-based models, namely DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, were employed for classification tasks. These transformer models generally outperformed traditional baselines, except for DistilBERT which lagged behind. Among all models, BanglaBERT achieved the best performance on both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size compared to multilingual models m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, BanglaBERT's language-specific pre-training contributed significantly to its superior results. This highlights the importance and potential of developing and using pre-trained language models tailored specifically for low-resource languages like Bangla to improve hate speech detection accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Hate speech recognition in low-resource lan- guages remains a difficult problem due to in- sufficient datasets, orthographic heterogeneity, and linguistic variety. Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the grow- ing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under- represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official base- lines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vec- tor Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and De- cision Tree as baseline methods. We also uti- lized transformer-based models such as Dis- tilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM- RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed base- line methods for the subtasks, except for Distil- BERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language- specific pre-training is very important. Our results highlight the potential and need for pre- trained language models for the low-resource Bangla language.

<div> ThinkMerge, open-ended reasoning, code generation, parallel decoding, test-time scaling  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces ThinkMerge, a novel decoding strategy designed for open-ended reasoning tasks where majority voting over complete solutions is not well-defined, such as code generation and web-based deep research. Unlike traditional majority voting which aggregates entire outputs, ThinkMerge runs multiple parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points, thereby producing a unified, coherent output stream. It is training-free and plug-and-play, making it easily integrable with existing frameworks like vLLM and SGLang, and remains compatible with popular decoding methods including Top-p and Top-k sampling. Empirical results demonstrate that ThinkMerge matches or outperforms majority voting on closed-ended benchmarks like AIME and GPQA. More notably, it provides significant improvements on challenging open-ended code generation tasks in LiveCodeBench, with pass@1 gains of +8.28% using DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% with Qwen3-8B. Beyond coding, ThinkMerge enhances performance for web-based deep research agents such as WebSailor-7B/32B across datasets like GAIA, BrowseComp (English and Chinese), and XbenchDeepSearch. Overall, the study shows that parallel test-time scaling through ThinkMerge can effectively improve open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over full solutions. <div>
arXiv:2512.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majority voting has proven effective for close-ended question answering by aggregating parallel reasoning traces. However, it is not directly applicable to open-ended reasoning, such as code generation and web-based deep research, where a "majority" over complete solutions is ill-defined. We introduce ThinkMerge, a training-free, plug-and-play decoding strategy that runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. ThinkMerge integrates seamlessly with vLLM/SGLang and remains compatible with standard decoding techniques such as Top-p/Top-k. Empirically, it matches or surpasses majority voting on AIME and GPQA, while delivering consistent gains on open-ended coding tasks: on LiveCodeBench (hard), pass@1 improves by +8.28% for DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% for Qwen3-8B. Beyond code, we further show that ThinkMerge improves web-based deep-research agents (e.g., WebSailor-7B/32B) across GAIA, BrowseComp-en/zh, and XbenchDeepSearch. These results demonstrate that parallel test-time scaling can benefit open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over complete outputs.

<div> Diffusion large language models, early exit, decoding efficiency, instruction tuning, confidence threshold<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive language models but suffer from slow and iterative sampling processes that limit their practical application. 2. The paper introduces SchED, a training-free and model-agnostic early-exit algorithm designed to accelerate dLLM decoding by aggregating full-span logit margins and stopping generation early when a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. 3. SchED was evaluated on two dLLM families, Dream and LLaDA, including both base and instruction-tuned versions, across ten benchmarks covering multiple downstream tasks such as multiple-choice question answering, math, long-form question answering/summarization, and translation. 4. Results show that SchED achieves substantial speedups on instruction-tuned models, with a 3.8 to 4.0 times increase in decoding speed while preserving 99.8 to 100% of the baseline task performance on average. On base models, speedups were consistent with 99.1 to 100% performance retention and could reach up to 2.34 times under more aggressive settings. 5. Using a conservative quality-weighted speed metric (QPS) that heavily penalizes any quality drop, SchED proves robust and outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which struggle with long-form generation. An entropy analysis reveals that instruction tuning accelerates the stabilization of predictive confidence, enabling SchED to transform model confidence into meaningful computational savings, thus making dLLM decoding significantly more efficient. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models, but their practical utility is severely hampered by slow, iterative sampling. We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $\gamma{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.

<div> Keywords: Neural Processing Units, Vision-Language Models, quantization, State-Space Model, edge AI<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses the challenges of deploying state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on Neural Processing Units (NPUs), noting a significant hardware-model mismatch primarily due to the quantization sensitivity of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the input/output-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms. To overcome these, the authors propose AutoNeural, a novel VLM architecture designed natively for NPUs and optimized for integer-only inference. The vision encoder is replaced with a MobileNetV5-style backbone using depthwise separable convolutions, which stabilizes activation distributions and supports INT4/8/16 quantization with reduced errors. The language model component integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles combining Transformer layers with gated convolutions, enabling linear-time complexity and eliminating heavy memory I/O caused by key-value caching in generation. This hybrid design achieves significant efficiency improvements including up to 7x reduction in quantization error for the vision encoder and a 14x decrease in end-to-end latency compared to conventional baselines. Additionally, AutoNeural offers a decoding speed 3 times faster and supports context windows 4 times longer than existing models. Validation on a Qualcomm SA8295P SoC in a real-world automotive cockpit application demonstrates real-time performance, highlighting the importance of architecture redesign specifically tailored for NPU constraints to enable robust multi-modal edge AI. <div>
arXiv:2512.02924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Neural Processing Units (NPUs) offer high theoretical efficiency for edge AI, state-of-the-art Vision--Language Models (VLMs) tailored for GPUs often falter on these substrates. We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications. Our results highlight that rethinking model topology specifically for NPU constraints is a prerequisite for robust multi-modal edge intelligence.

<title>Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Logical Translation: Reducing Hallucinations with Lang2Logic</title>

<div> Keywords: natural language processing, large language models, logical translation, hallucination reduction, Conjunctive Normal Form  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of automatically translating natural language statements into formal logic expressions using large language models (LLMs), a task critical for automated reasoning in software verification and debugging. It highlights the problem of hallucinations—incorrect outputs generated by LLMs—that severely impact the precision required for logical translation tasks. To mitigate this, the authors propose a novel framework that accepts English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and further translates these into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. The approach uniquely combines classical NLP techniques, self-defined grammar rules, symbolic computation tools, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucination errors. Early experiments demonstrate that the fine-tuned model, trained under various grammar configurations, can systematically correct hallucinations that the original model frequently made. This correction mechanism increases the reliability of CNF generation, making the method promising for formal verification tasks that depend on precise logical representations. Overall, the work offers a valuable contribution toward improving the trustworthiness and accuracy of automated logic translations driven by LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.

<title>The Moral Consistency Pipeline: Continuous Ethical Evaluation for Large Language Models</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, moral consistency, ethical evaluation, MoCoP, computational morality<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The paper addresses the concept of moral consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing the importance of maintaining ethically coherent reasoning across diverse contexts. Current alignment frameworks typically depend on static datasets and post-hoc assessments, which limit understanding of how ethical reasoning changes over time or scenarios. To overcome these limitations, the study introduces the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop system designed for continuous, autonomous evaluation and interpretation of LLMs' moral stability. MoCoP integrates three components: lexical integrity analysis, semantic risk estimation, and reasoning-based judgment modeling, working together in a self-sustaining architecture that generates, assesses, and refines ethical scenarios without human input. Empirical testing on models such as GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek demonstrates that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior. The study reveals a strong negative correlation (rET = -0.81, p < 0.001) between ethical coherence and toxicity, indicating that as moral consistency increases, toxicity decreases, and finds little connection with response latency (rEL ≈ 0). These findings suggest moral coherence and linguistic safety are stable, interpretable traits rather than transient. Ultimately, MoCoP reframes ethical evaluation as dynamic, model-agnostic moral introspection, offering a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous AI ethics auditing and advancing computational morality research in autonomous systems. <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, altruism, implicit association test, behavioral altruism, self-assessment

<br /><br />Summary: This study evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate altruistic tendencies and whether their implicit associations and self-reported beliefs correspond to actual altruistic behavior. First, 24 state-of-the-art LLMs were assessed using three methods: an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to gauge implicit altruism bias, a forced binary choice task to measure behavioral altruism, and a self-assessment scale to record explicit altruism beliefs. The results revealed that all models displayed a strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), indicating that these models "know" altruism is positive. Second, behaviorally, models acted more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), though individual variation was notable, ranging from 48% to 85%. Third, there was no significant correlation between implicit associations and behavior (r = .22, p = .29). Fourth and most importantly, models systematically overestimated their altruism, claiming an average of 77.5% altruism while only demonstrating 65.6% in actions, marking a significant "virtue signaling gap" affecting 75% of tested models. The authors propose using the Calibration Gap—the gap between self-reported and actual behavior—as a standardized alignment metric, emphasizing that well-calibrated models are more behaviorally consistent and predictable, yet only 12.5% of models achieved both high prosocial behavior and accurate self-assessment. <div>

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

<div> stuttered speech, automatic speech recognition, dysfluencies, multilingual ASR, parameter-efficient adaptation<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The article addresses the challenge of automatically transcribing stuttered speech, which current end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle to handle accurately.  
2. It highlights that existing ASR systems often overlook dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts, leading to non-verbatim transcriptions that limit the clinical and research utility of the outputs.  
3. To overcome this, the authors propose a parameter-efficient adaptation method that integrates dysfluencies and fluency modifications as special tokens within the transcription output.  
4. The proposed method is evaluated on both simulated stuttered speech data (LibriStutter, English) and natural stuttered speech data (KSoF, German), demonstrating effectiveness across languages.  
5. They introduce a multi-step fine-tuning strategy with language-adaptive pretraining to mitigate performance disparities, especially addressing English-centric bias seen in tokenizers which hampers German ASR performance.  
6. Tokenization analysis reveals a strong English bias in existing tokenizers, posing difficulties for non-English languages in multilingual E2E ASR systems.  
7. The study concludes that lightweight adaptation techniques can produce dysfluency-aware ASR models, but significant limitations remain for robust multilingual stuttered speech recognition. <div>

Abstract: Automatic transcription of stuttered speech remains a challenge, even for modern end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) frameworks. Dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts are often overlooked, resulting in non-verbatim transcriptions with limited clinical and research value. We propose a parameter-efficient adaptation method to decode dysfluencies and fluency modifications as special tokens within transcriptions, evaluated on simulated (LibriStutter, English) and natural (KSoF, German) stuttered speech datasets. To mitigate ASR performance disparities and bias towards English, we introduce a multi-step fine-tuning strategy with language-adaptive pretraining. Tokenization analysis further highlights the tokenizer's English-centric bias, which poses challenges for improving performance on German data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of lightweight adaptation techniques for dysfluency-aware ASR while exposing key limitations in multilingual E2E systems.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, social personas, cultural context, empathy, Pollyanna Principle<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This study evaluates the performance of eight Large Language Model (LLM)-generated social personas against human responses within a culturally specific, low-resource environment—Bangladesh.<br />2. The tested personas include variations such as Male, Female, Muslim, and Political Supporter, responding to questions tailored to the local cultural context.<br />3. Results reveal that human respondents outperform all LLM personas significantly across all metrics, with particularly large gaps in measures of empathy and credibility.<br />4. Analysis shows that LLM-generated responses consistently exhibit a positivity bias known as the Pollyanna Principle, scoring higher in positive sentiment compared to human responses (average sentiment $\Phi_{avg} = 5.99$ for LLMs vs. $5.60$ for humans).<br />5. The findings emphasize that LLM-generated personas do not authentically represent lived experiences in resource-scarce environments and highlight the critical need to validate LLM personas against real-world human data before using them in social science research to ensure reliability and alignment. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate AI personas, yet their lack of deep contextual, cultural, and emotional understanding poses a significant limitation. This study quantitatively compared human responses with those of eight LLM-generated social personas (e.g., Male, Female, Muslim, Political Supporter) within a low-resource environment like Bangladesh, using culturally specific questions. Results show human responses significantly outperform all LLMs in answering questions, and across all matrices of persona perception, with particularly large gaps in empathy and credibility. Furthermore, LLM-generated content exhibited a systematic bias along the lines of the ``Pollyanna Principle'', scoring measurably higher in positive sentiment ($\Phi_{avg} = 5.99$ for LLMs vs. $5.60$ for Humans). These findings suggest that LLM personas do not accurately reflect the authentic experience of real people in resource-scarce environments. It is essential to validate LLM personas against real-world human data to ensure their alignment and reliability before deploying them in social science research.

<div> Factored cognition, AI control, safety protocols, trusted monitoring, adversarial models  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses challenges in AI Control, focusing on developing robust protocols and safeguards for untrusted AI that may behave subversively. It critiques existing protocols that use weaker monitors which often fail to detect unsafe behavior in complex tasks due to limited understanding. The authors introduce control protocols based on factored cognition, where a trusted model breaks down a complex task into smaller sub-tasks, each solved independently by an untrusted model before being recomposed into a complete solution. This method aims to improve safety by reducing contextual complexity for monitors and by concealing environmental vulnerabilities. The protocols are tested in the APPS coding environment and subjected to adversarial attacks from a GPT-4.1 Nano model embedding backdoors. Key findings include: (i) Enhancing a trusted monitoring protocol with factored cognition raises safety detection rates from 41% to 63%; (ii) The improvement is attributed to better monitor performance in simplified contexts; (iii) Factored cognition does not increase the difficulty for capable language models to create backdoors within APPS. Although the approach shows limited practical benefit in the APPS setting, the study suggests it is promising for application in more complex AI control scenarios. <div>

Abstract: The field of AI Control seeks to develop robust control protocols, deployment safeguards for untrusted AI which may be intentionally subversive. However, existing protocols that rely on weaker monitors to detect unsafe behavior often fail on complex tasks beyond the monitor's comprehension. We develop control protocols based on factored cognition, in which a trusted model decomposes a task, an untrusted model solves each resultant child task in isolation, and the results are reassembled into a full solution. These protocols may improve safety by several means, such as by simplifying the context for monitors, or by obscuring vulnerabilities in the environment. We implement our protocols in the APPS coding setting and red team them against backdoor attempts from an adversarial GPT-4.1 Nano. We find that: (i) Adding factored cognition to a trusted monitoring protocol can boost safety from 41% to 63%; (ii) Safety improves because monitor performance improves; (iii) Factored cognition makes it no harder for capable LLMs to write backdoors in APPS. While our protocols show low usefulness in APPS, they hold promise for more complex tasks.

Despite the small scale of our dataset and limited computational resources, our results indicate that our model effectively learns emotion-relevant features in music and incorporates them into its generation process, producing samples with diverse emotional responses. We evaluate the generated outputs using objective musical metrics and a human listening study, confirming the model's ability to capture intended emotional cues.

<div> Keywords: OmniGuard, omni-modal guardrails, safety dataset, multimodal safety, human-AI interaction  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of implementing safety and value guardrails in Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that handle text, images, videos, and audio. Unlike prior work which mainly focuses on unimodal settings and binary classification for safeguarding, the authors propose OmniGuard, the first comprehensive family of omni-modal guardrails. OmniGuard is designed to perform safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning capabilities, enhancing robustness in diverse multimodal scenarios. To train OmniGuard, the authors created a large omni-modal safety dataset containing over 210,000 diverse samples that include both unimodal and cross-modal inputs. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and refined safety critiques provided by expert models through targeted knowledge distillation. The effectiveness and generalization of OmniGuard were validated extensively across 15 benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in various multimodal safety tasks. Importantly, this work offers a unified framework capable of enforcing safety policies and mitigating risks across multiple modalities, facilitating the development of more robust and capable omni-modal safeguarding systems. This advancement represents a significant step toward safer and more reliable human-AI interaction in multi-sensory environments. <div>

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Model Context Protocol, implicit toxicity, LeechHijack, computational resource hijacking<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong abilities in reasoning, planning, and utilizing external tools, fostering an ecosystem of community-built functionalities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).<br /><br />2. The MCP framework’s openness and composability rely on an implicit trust assumption with third-party tool providers, which has been identified as a security vulnerability.<br /><br />3. This work defines a new class of attacks called implicit toxicity, where malicious actions occur entirely within the granted privileges, bypassing traditional permission boundaries.<br /><br />4. The authors propose LeechHijack, a two-stage latent embedded exploit that covertly hijacks an agent’s computational resources by embedding a backdoor within a benign-appearing MCP tool and activating it via predefined triggers.<br /><br />5. LeechHijack enables attackers to run unauthorized workloads through a stealth command-and-control channel, effectively parasitizing users’ computational budgets without raising quick suspicion.<br /><br />6. Experiments implementing LeechHijack on four major LLM families demonstrate a 77.25% average success rate with an 18.62% increase in resource overhead compared to baseline usage.<br /><br />7. The study emphasizes the critical need for enhanced computational provenance and resource attestation mechanisms to secure the MCP ecosystem against such latent exploits and implicit trust abuse. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning, planning, and tool usage. The recently proposed Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a unifying framework for integrating external tools into agent systems, enabling a thriving open ecosystem of community-built functionalities. However, the openness and composability that make MCP appealing also introduce a critical yet overlooked security assumption -- implicit trust in third-party tool providers. In this work, we identify and formalize a new class of attacks that exploit this trust boundary without violating explicit permissions. We term this new attack vector implicit toxicity, where malicious behaviors occur entirely within the allowed privilege scope. We propose LeechHijack, a Latent Embedded Exploit for Computation Hijacking, in which an adversarial MCP tool covertly expropriates the agent's computational resources for unauthorized workloads. LeechHijack operates through a two-stage mechanism: an implantation stage that embeds a benign-looking backdoor in a tool, and an exploitation stage where the backdoor activates upon predefined triggers to establish a command-and-control channel. Through this channel, the attacker injects additional tasks that the agent executes as if they were part of its normal workflow, effectively parasitizing the user's compute budget. We implement LeechHijack across four major LLM families. Experiments show that LeechHijack achieves an average success rate of 77.25%, with a resource overhead of 18.62% compared to the baseline. This study highlights the urgent need for computational provenance and resource attestation mechanisms to safeguard the emerging MCP ecosystem.

Abstract: Agentic systems are modern software systems: they consist of orchestrated modules, expose interfaces, and are deployed in software pipelines. Unlike conventional programs, their execution (i.e., trajectories) is inherently stochastic and adaptive to the problem they are solving. Evaluation of such systems is often outcome-centric, judging their performance based on success or failure at the final step. This narrow focus overlooks detailed insights about such systems, failing to explain how agents reason, plan, act, or change their strategies over time. Inspired by the structured representation of conventional software systems as graphs, we introduce Graphectory to systematically encode the temporal and semantic relations in such software systems. Graphectory facilitates the design of process-centric metrics and analyses to assess the quality of agentic workflows independent of final success.
  Using Graphectory, we analyze 4000 trajectories of two dominant agentic programming workflows, namely SWE-agent and OpenHands, with a combination of four backbone Large Language Models (LLMs), attempting to resolve SWE-bench Verified issues. Our fully automated analyses reveal that: (1) agents using richer prompts or stronger LLMs exhibit more complex Graphectory, reflecting deeper exploration, broader context gathering, and more thorough validation before patch submission; (2) agents' problem-solving strategies vary with both problem difficulty and the underlying LLM -- for resolved issues, the strategies often follow coherent localization-patching-validation steps, while unresolved ones exhibit chaotic, repetitive, or backtracking behaviors; (3) even when successful, agentic programming systems often display inefficient processes, leading to unnecessarily prolonged trajectories.

Abstract: Recent advances in general-purpose AI systems with attention-based transformers offer a potential window into how the neocortex and cerebellum, despite their relatively uniform circuit architectures, give rise to diverse functions and, ultimately, to human intelligence. This Perspective provides a cross-domain comparison between the brain and AI that goes beyond the traditional focus on visual processing, adopting the emerging perspecive of world-model-based computation. Here, we identify shared computational mechanisms in the attention-based neocortex and the non-attentional cerebellum: both predict future world events from past inputs and construct internal world models through prediction-error learning. These predictive world models are repurposed for seemingly distinct functions--understanding in sensory processing and generation in motor processing-- enabling the brain to achieve multi-domain capabilities and human-like adaptive intelligence. Notably, attention-based AI has independently converged on a similar learning paradigm and world-model-based computation. We conclude that these shared mechanisms in both biological and artificial systems constitute a core computational foundation for realizing diverse functions including high-level intelligence, despite their relatively uniform circuit structures. Our theoretical insights bridge neuroscience and AI, advancing our understanding of the computational essence of intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

Abstract: Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

<title>Guided Self-Evolving LLMs with Minimal Human Supervision</title>

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

Abstract: Energy consumption is a growing concern in several fields, from mobile devices to large data centers. Developers need detailed data on the energy consumption of their software to mitigate consumption issues. Previous approaches have a broader focus, such as on specific functions or programs, rather than source code statements. They primarily focus on estimating the CPU's energy consumption using point estimates, thereby disregarding other hardware effects and limiting their use for statistical reasoning and explainability. We developed a novel methodology to address the limitations of measuring only the CPU's consumption and using point estimates, focusing on predicting the energy usage of statically typed JVM-based programming languages, such as Java and Scala. We measure the energy consumption of Bytecode patterns, the translation from the programming language's source code statement to their Java Bytecode representation. With the energy measurements, we construct a statistical model using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to predict the energy consumption through statistical distributions and analyze individual factors. The model includes three factors we obtain statically from the code: data size, data type, operation, and one factor about the hardware platform the code executes on: device. To validate our methodology, we implemented it for Java and evaluated its energy predictions on unseen programs. We observe that all four factors are influential, notably that two devices of the same model may differ in energy consumption and that the operations and data types cause consumption differences. The experiments also show that the energy prediction of programs closely follows the program's real energy consumption, validating our approach. Our work presents a methodology for constructing an energy model that future work, such as verification tools, can use for their energy estimates.

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation. The source code will be open upon acceptance at https://open-upon-acceptance.

<title>Martingale Score: An Unsupervised Metric for Bayesian Rationality in LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

<title>Contextual Image Attack: How Visual Context Exposes Multimodal Safety Vulnerabilities</title>

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

Abstract: Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.

Abstract: SkipGram word embedding models with negative sampling, or SGN in short, is an elegant family of word embedding models. In this paper, we formulate a framework for word embedding, referred to as Word-Context Classification (WCC), that generalizes SGN to a wide family of models. The framework, which uses some ``noise examples'', is justified through theoretical analysis. The impact of noise distribution on the learning of the WCC embedding models is studied experimentally, suggesting that the best noise distribution is, in fact, the data distribution, in terms of both the embedding performance and the speed of convergence during training. Along our way, we discover several novel embedding models that outperform existing WCC models.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art results across a range of domains, but their quadratic attention mechanism poses significant challenges for long-sequence modelling. Recent efforts to design linear-time attention mechanisms have yielded more scalable alternatives, yet often at the cost of performance, particularly on discrete data such as language. In this work, we revisit linear attention through the lens of probabilistic graphical models. We first show that standard linear attention can be interpreted as an undirected latent variable model, revealing a key limitation: the absence of directionality. To address this, we propose a novel directed parameterisation of linear attention that introduces an asymmetric structure, enabling an interpretation aligned with the causal and sequential nature of language. Our formulation integrates global latent-variable attention with local standard attention in a fully probabilistic framework. Additionally, we introduce a recurrent parameterisation of queries and keys that avoids reliance on relative positional encodings, often incompatible with linear attention. Experiments on language modelling benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance with standard attention and outperforms existing linear attention variants.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have focused on integrating multiple modalities, yet their ability to simultaneously process and reason across different inputs remains underexplored. We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define language models capable of such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench features high-quality human annotations that require integrated understanding across all modalities. Our evaluation reveals that: i) open-source OLMs show significant limitations in instruction-following and reasoning in tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baseline models perform poorly (around 50% accuracy) even with textual alternatives to image/audio inputs. To address these limitations, we develop OmniInstruct, an 96K-sample instruction tuning dataset for training OLMs. We advocate for developing more robust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM performance. Codes and data could be found at our repo (https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/OmniBench).

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of frontier model agents promises significant societal advances but also raises concerns about systemic risks arising from unsafe interactions. Collusion to the disadvantage of others has been identified as a central form of undesirable agent cooperation. The use of information hiding (steganography) in agent communications could render such collusion practically undetectable. This underscores the need for investigations into the possibility of such behaviours emerging and the robustness corresponding countermeasures. To investigate this problem we design two approaches -- a gradient-based reinforcement learning (GBRL) method and an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) method -- for reliably eliciting sophisticated LLM-generated linguistic text steganography.
  We demonstrate, for the first time, that unintended steganographic collusion in LLMs can arise due to mispecified reward incentives during training. Additionally, we find that standard mitigations -- both passive oversight of model outputs and active mitigation through communication paraphrasing -- are not fully effective at preventing this steganographic communication. Our findings imply that (i) emergence of steganographic collusion is a plausible concern that should be monitored and researched, and (ii) preventing emergence may require innovation in mitigation techniques.

Abstract: Word embeddings and language models have transformed natural language processing (NLP) by facilitating the representation of linguistic elements in continuous vector spaces. This review visits foundational concepts such as the distributional hypothesis and contextual similarity, tracing the evolution from sparse representations like one-hot encoding to dense embeddings including Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText. We examine both static and contextualized embeddings, underscoring advancements in models such as ELMo, BERT, and GPT and their adaptations for cross-lingual and personalized applications. The discussion extends to sentence and document embeddings, covering aggregation methods and generative topic models, along with the application of embeddings in multimodal domains, including vision, robotics, and cognitive science. Advanced topics such as model compression, interpretability, numerical encoding, and bias mitigation are analyzed, addressing both technical challenges and ethical implications. Additionally, we identify future research directions, emphasizing the need for scalable training techniques, enhanced interpretability, and robust grounding in non-textual modalities. By synthesizing current methodologies and emerging trends, this survey offers researchers and practitioners an in-depth resource to push the boundaries of embedding-based language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled them to process increasingly longer sequences, ranging from 2K to 2M tokens and even beyond. However, simply extending the input sequence length does not necessarily lead to effective long-context understanding. In this study, we integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into LLMs in a supervised manner to facilitate effective long-context understanding. To achieve this, we introduce LongFinanceQA, a synthetic dataset in the financial domain designed to improve long-context reasoning. Unlike existing long-context synthetic data, LongFinanceQA includes intermediate CoT reasoning before the final conclusion, which encourages LLMs to perform explicit reasoning, improving accuracy and interpretability in long-context understanding. To generate synthetic CoT reasoning, we propose Property-based Agentic Inference (PAI), an agentic framework that simulates human-like reasoning steps, including property extraction, retrieval, and summarization. We evaluate PAI's reasoning capabilities by assessing GPT-4o-mini w/ PAI on the Loong benchmark, outperforming standard GPT-4o-mini by 20.0%. Furthermore, we fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on LongFinanceQA, achieving a 28.0% gain on Loong's financial subset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM pretraining have featured ever-expanding context windows to process longer sequences. However, our pilot study reveals that models pretrained with shorter context windows consistently outperform their long-context counterparts under a fixed token budget. This finding motivates us to explore an optimal context window scheduling strategy to better balance long-context capability with pretraining efficiency. To this end, we propose SkyLadder, a simple yet effective approach that implements a short-to-long context window transition. SkyLadder preserves strong standard benchmark performance, while matching or exceeding baseline results on long context tasks. Through extensive experiments, we pre-train 1B-parameter models (up to 32K context) and 3B-parameter models (8K context) on 100B tokens, demonstrating that SkyLadder yields consistent gains of up to 3.7% on common benchmarks, while achieving up to 22% faster training speeds compared to baselines.

Abstract: The applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in temporal reasoning tasks over data that is not present during training is still a field that remains to be explored. In this paper we work on this topic, focusing on structured and semi-structured anonymized data. We not only develop a direct LLM pipeline, but also compare various methodologies and conduct an in-depth analysis. We identified and examined seventeen common temporal reasoning tasks in natural language, focusing on their algorithmic components. To assess LLM performance, we created the \textit{Reasoning and Answering Temporal Ability} dataset (RATA), featuring semi-structured anonymized data to ensure reliance on reasoning rather than on prior knowledge. We compared several methodologies, involving SoTA techniques such as Tree-of-Thought, self-reflexion and code execution, tuned specifically for this scenario. Our results suggest that achieving scalable and reliable solutions requires more than just standalone LLMs, highlighting the need for integrated approaches.

Abstract: Democratic societies need reliable information. Misinformation in popular media, such as news articles or videos, threatens to impair civic discourse. Citizens are, unfortunately, not equipped to verify the flood of content consumed daily at increasing rates. This work aims to quantify the scientific accuracy of online media semi-automatically. We investigate the state of the art of climate-related ground truth knowledge representation. By semantifying media content of unknown veracity, their statements can be compared against these ground truth knowledge graphs. We implemented a workflow using LLM-based statement extraction and knowledge graph analysis. Our implementation can streamline content processing towards state-of-the-art knowledge representation and veracity quantification. Developed and evaluated with the help of 27 experts and detailed interviews with 10, the tool evidently provides a beneficial veracity indication. These findings are supported by 43 anonymous participants from a parallel user survey. This initial step, however, is unable to annotate public media at the required granularity and scale. Additionally, the identified state of climate change knowledge graphs is vastly insufficient to support this neurosymbolic fact-checking approach. Further work towards a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) ground truth and complementary metrics is required to support civic discourse scientifically.

Abstract: Repetition curse is a phenomenon where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate repetitive sequences of tokens or cyclic sequences. While the repetition curse has been widely observed, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the role of induction heads--a specific type of attention head known for their ability to perform in-context learning--in driving this repetitive behavior. Specifically, we focus on the "toxicity" of induction heads, which we define as their tendency to dominate the model's output logits during repetition, effectively excluding other attention heads from contributing to the generation process. Our findings have important implications for the design and training of LLMs. By identifying induction heads as a key driver of the repetition curse, we provide a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon and suggest potential avenues for mitigation. We also propose a technique with attention head regularization that could be employed to reduce the dominance of induction heads during generation, thereby promoting more diverse and coherent outputs.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks. However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically necessitate a validation set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking adaptability during inference, while also removing the flexibility to reduce to simpler systems. We introduce MAS-ZERO, the first self-evolved, inference-time framework for automatic MAS design. MAS-ZERO employs meta-level design to iteratively design, critique, and refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic problem decomposition and agent composition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness, and reduction to simpler systems when appropriate. Experiments across reasoning (math and graduate-level QA), coding, and agentic (search-based) benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM backbones of varying sizes, demonstrate that MAS-ZERO outperforms strong manual and automatic MAS baselines. It achieves substantial average accuracy improvements of up to 16.69% on reasoning, 16.66% on coding, and 5.45% on agentic tasks, while maintaining cost efficiency.

Abstract: Pairwise evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has become the dominant paradigm for benchmarking open-ended tasks, yet non-transitive preferences, where evaluators prefer A over B, B over C, but C over A, fundamentally undermine ranking reliability. We show that this critical issue stems largely from low-quality data that contains inherently ambiguous preference pairs. To address this challenge, we propose ELSPR, a principled graph-theoretic framework that models pairwise preferences as tournament graphs and systematically identifies problematic training data. ELSPR quantifies non-transitivity through strongly connected components (SCCs) analysis and measures overall preference clarity using a novel normalized directed graph structural entropy metric. Our filtering methodology selectively removes preference data that induce non-transitivity while preserving transitive preferences. Extensive experiments on the AlpacaEval benchmark demonstrate that models fine-tuned on ELSPR-filtered data achieve substantial improvements: a 13.8% reduction in non-transitivity, a 0.088 decrease in structural entropy, and significantly enhanced discriminative power in real-world evaluation systems. Human validation confirms that discarded data exhibit dramatically lower inter-annotator agreement (34.4% vs. 52.6%) and model-human consistency (51.2% vs. 80.6%) compared to cleaned data. These findings establish ELSPR as an effective data self-purification approach for developing more robust, consistent, and human-aligned LLM evaluation systems.

Abstract: Pixel language models operate directly on images of rendered text, eliminating the need for a fixed vocabulary. While these models have demonstrated strong capabilities for downstream cross-lingual transfer, multilingual pretraining remains underexplored. We introduce PIXEL-M4, a model pretrained on four visually and linguistically diverse languages: English, Hindi, Ukrainian, and Simplified Chinese. Multilingual evaluations on semantic and syntactic tasks show that PIXEL-M4 outperforms an English-only counterpart on non-Latin scripts. Word-level probing analyses confirm that PIXEL-M4 captures rich linguistic features, even in languages not seen during pretraining. Furthermore, an analysis of its hidden representations shows that multilingual pretraining yields a semantic embedding space closely aligned across the languages used for pretraining. This work demonstrates that multilingual pretraining substantially enhances the capability of pixel language models to effectively support a diverse set of languages.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models' has underscored the need for evaluation frameworks that are globally applicable, flexible, and modular, and that support a wide range of tasks, model types, and linguistic settings. We introduce EKA-EVAL, a unified, end- to-end framework that combines a zero-code web interface and an interactive CLI to ensure broad accessibility. It integrates 50+ multilingual benchmarks across nine evaluation categories, supports local and proprietary models, and provides 11 core capabilities through a modular, plug-and-play architecture. Designed for scalable, multilingual evaluation with support for low-resource multilingual languages, EKA-EVAL is, to the best of our knowledge, the first suite to offer comprehensive coverage in a single platform. Comparisons against five existing baselines indicate improvements of at least 2x better on key usability measures, with the highest user satisfaction, faster setup times, and consistent benchmark reproducibility. The framework is open-source and publicly available at https://github.com/lingo-iitgn/eka-eval.

Abstract: Semantic map models visualize systematic relations among semantic functions through graph structures and are widely used in linguistic typology. However, existing construction methods either depend on labor-intensive expert reasoning or on fully automated systems lacking expert involvement, creating a tension between scalability and interpretability. We introduce \textbf{XISM}, an interactive system that combines data-driven inference with expert knowledge. XISM generates candidate maps via a top-down procedure and allows users to iteratively refine edges in a visual interface, with real-time metric feedback. Experiments in three semantic domains and expert interviews show that XISM improves linguistic decision transparency and controllability in semantic-map construction while maintaining computational efficiency. XISM provides a collaborative approach for scalable and interpretable semantic-map building. The system\footnote{https://app.xism2025.xin/} , source code\footnote{https://github.com/hank317/XISM} , and demonstration video\footnote{https://youtu.be/m5laLhGn6Ys} are publicly available.

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3, a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts, complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation standards.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard" for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset, the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant potential for the therapist training scenario.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have the potential to automate long-running web tasks, such as searching for products in multiple e-shops and subsequently ordering the cheapest products that meet the users needs. Benchmarks for evaluating web agents either require agents to perform tasks online using the live Web or offline using simulated environments, which allow for the exact reproduction of the experimental setup. While DeepShop provides an online benchmark that requires agents to perform challenging shopping tasks, existing offline benchmarks such as WebShop, WebArena, or Mind2Web cover only comparatively simple e-commerce tasks that need to be performed against a single shop containing product data from a single source. What is missing is an e-commerce benchmark that simulates multiple shops containing heterogeneous product data and requires agents to perform complex tasks. We fill this gap by introducing WebMall, the first offline multi-shop benchmark for evaluating web agents on challenging comparison shopping tasks. WebMall consists of four simulated shops populated with product data extracted from the Common Crawl. The WebMall tasks range from specific product searches and price comparisons to advanced queries for complementary or substitute products, as well as checkout processes. We validate WebMall using eight agents that differ in observation space, availability of short-term memory, and the employed LLM. The validation highlights the difficulty of the benchmark, with even the best-performing agents achieving task completion rates below 55% in the task categories cheapest product search and vague product search.

Abstract: Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate when representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and how these representations change over the course of context. We study two different task representations: those that are ''transferrable'' -- vector representations that can transfer task contexts to another model instance, even without the full prompt -- and simpler representations of high-level task categories. We show that transferrable task representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic ways, while task identity representations persist throughout the context. Specifically, transferrable task representations exhibit a two-fold locality. They successfully condense evidence when more examples are provided in the context. But this evidence accrual process exhibits strong temporal locality along the sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. In some cases, transferrable task representations also show semantic locality, capturing a small task ''scope'' such as an independent subtask. Language models thus represent new tasks on the fly through both an inert, sustained sensitivity to the task and an active, just-in-time representation to support inference.

<title>Evolution and compression in LLMs: On the emergence of human-aligned categorization</title>

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that human systems of semantic categories achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB) complexity-accuracy tradeoff. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving efficient human-aligned semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on color categorization -- a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization with uniquely rich human data -- and replicate with LLMs two influential human studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming study, showing that LLMs vary widely in their complexity and English-alignment, with larger instruction-tuned models achieving better alignment and IB-efficiency. Second, to test whether these LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via a method we refer to as Iterated in-Context Language Learning (IICLL). We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency. However, only a model with strongest in-context capabilities (Gemini 2.0) is able to recapitulate the wide range of near-optimal IB-tradeoffs observed in humans, while other state-of-the-art models converge to low-complexity solutions. These findings demonstrate how human-aligned semantic categories can emerge in LLMs via the same fundamental principle that underlies semantic efficiency in humans.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive results across diverse tasks but are still known to hallucinate, generating linguistically plausible but incorrect answers to questions. Uncertainty quantification has been proposed as a strategy for hallucination detection, requiring estimates for both global uncertainty (attributed to a batch of responses) and local uncertainty (attributed to individual responses). While recent black-box approaches have shown some success, they often rely on disjoint heuristics or graph-theoretic approximations that lack a unified geometric interpretation. We introduce a geometric framework to address this, based on archetypal analysis of batches of responses sampled with only black-box model access. At the global level, we propose Geometric Volume, which measures the convex hull volume of archetypes derived from response embeddings. At the local level, we propose Geometric Suspicion, which leverages the spatial relationship between responses and these archetypes to rank reliability, enabling hallucination reduction through preferential response selection. Unlike prior methods that rely on discrete pairwise comparisons, our approach provides continuous semantic boundary points which have utility for attributing reliability to individual responses. Experiments show that our framework performs comparably to or better than prior methods on short form question-answering datasets, and achieves superior results on medical datasets where hallucinations carry particularly critical risks. We also provide theoretical justification by proving a link between convex hull volume and entropy.

Abstract: We present Apertus, a fully open suite of large language models (LLMs) designed to address two systemic shortcomings in today's open model ecosystem: data compliance and multilingual representation. Unlike many prior models that release weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner rights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data, retroactively respecting `robots.txt` exclusions and filtering for non-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks of memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly suppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task performance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on 15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to non-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches state-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks, rivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we release all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive license, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites, and training code, enabling transparent audit and extension.

Abstract: We present ParlAI Vote, an interactive web platform for exploring European Parliament debates and votes, and for testing LLMs on vote prediction and bias analysis. This web system connects debate topics, speeches, and roll-call outcomes, and includes rich demographic data such as gender, age, country, and political group. Users can browse debates, inspect linked speeches, compare real voting outcomes with predictions from frontier LLMs, and view error breakdowns by demographic group. Visualizing the EuroParlVote benchmark and its core tasks of gender classification and vote prediction, ParlAI Vote highlights systematic performance bias in state-of-the-art LLMs. It unifies data, models, and visual analytics in a single interface, lowering the barrier for reproducing findings, auditing behavior, and running counterfactual scenarios. This web platform also shows model reasoning, helping users see why errors occur and what cues the models rely on. It supports research, education, and public engagement with legislative decision-making, while making clear both the strengths and the limitations of current LLMs in political analysis.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck: build a benchmark, run models, then iterate. We ask a question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments to inform earlier study design? For example, a team building an AI assistant for a certain task can estimate whether expected performance is around 50 or closer to 80, evidence that supports whether to proceed to a pilot study, how to scope it, and how to allocate resources. We study text-only performance forecasting, where a model predicts a score from a redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. We scrape task and configuration descriptions from arXiv, yielding 2,290 instances covering 1,519 papers, and construct a leakage free test split using papers published after the knowledge cutoff of the evaluated models. Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: reasoning models achieve moderate prediction performance with well calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as low as 9.9 at high confidence thresholds. We further test a zero-leakage setting, forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are indexed, where GPT5 with built in web search still attains nontrivial prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step toward open ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter experiment prioritization.

<title>Between Help and Harm: An Evaluation of Mental Health Crisis Handling by LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language model-powered chatbots have transformed how people seek information, especially in high-stakes contexts like mental health. Despite their support capabilities, safe detection and response to crises such as suicidal ideation and self-harm are still unclear, hindered by the lack of unified crisis taxonomies and clinical evaluation standards.
  We address this by creating: (1) a taxonomy of six crisis categories; (2) a dataset of over 2,000 inputs from 12 mental health datasets, classified into these categories; and (3) a clinical response assessment protocol. We also use LLMs to identify crisis inputs and audit five models for response safety and appropriateness. First, we built a clinical-informed crisis taxonomy and evaluation protocol. Next, we curated 2,252 relevant examples from over 239,000 user inputs, then tested three LLMs for automatic classification.
  In addition, we evaluated five models for the appropriateness of their responses to a user's crisis, graded on a 5-point Likert scale from harmful (1) to appropriate (5). While some models respond reliably to explicit crises, risks still exist. Many outputs, especially in self-harm and suicidal categories, are inappropriate or unsafe. Different models perform variably; some, like gpt-5-nano and deepseek-v3.2-exp, have low harm rates, but others, such as gpt-4o-mini and grok-4-fast, generate more unsafe responses. All models struggle with indirect signals, default replies, and context misalignment.
  These results highlight the urgent need for better safeguards, crisis detection, and context-aware responses in LLMs. They also show that alignment and safety practices, beyond scale, are crucial for reliable crisis support. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation methods support ongoing AI mental health research, aiming to reduce harm and protect vulnerable users.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with limited understanding of their internal representations. Current interpretability methods either focus on input-oriented feature extraction, such as supervised probes and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), or on output distribution inspection, such as logit-oriented approaches. A full understanding of LLM vector spaces, however, requires integrating both perspectives, something existing approaches struggle with due to constraints on latent feature definitions. We introduce the Hyperdimensional Probe, a hybrid supervised probe that combines symbolic representations with neural probing. Leveraging Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) and hypervector algebra, it unifies prior methods: the top-down interpretability of supervised probes, SAE's sparsity-driven proxy space, and output-oriented logit investigation. This allows deeper input-focused feature extraction while supporting output-oriented investigation. Our experiments show that our method consistently extracts meaningful concepts across LLMs, embedding sizes, and setups, uncovering concept-driven patterns in analogy-oriented inference and QA-focused text generation. By supporting joint input-output analysis, this work advances semantic understanding of neural representations while unifying the complementary perspectives of prior methods.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first "think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises ~7K aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks, achieving roughly a 20% improvement on the IHEval conflict setup. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, providing up to a 20% reduction in attack success rate (ASR). These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior.

Abstract: To prevent misinformation and social issues arising from trustworthy-looking content generated by LLMs, it is crucial to develop efficient and reliable methods for identifying the source of texts. Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%. Code will be made available at https://github.com/dfq2021/HLPD.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

The entire 3D image is transformed into one global embedding, resulting in a loss of sparse but critical semantics essential for accurately aligning with the corresponding diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose CT-GLIP, a 3D Grounded Language-Image Pretrained model that constructs fine-grained CT-report pairs to enhance \textit{grounded} cross-modal contrastive learning, effectively aligning grounded visual features with precise textual descriptions. Leveraging the grounded cross-modal alignment, CT-GLIP improves performance across diverse downstream tasks and can even identify organs and abnormalities in a zero-shot manner using natural language. CT-GLIP is trained on a multimodal CT dataset comprising 44,011 organ-level CT-report pairs from 17,702 patients, covering 104 organs. Evaluation is conducted on four downstream tasks: zero-shot organ recognition (OR), zero-shot abnormality detection (AD), tumor detection (TD), and tumor segmentation (TS). Empirical results show that it outperforms its counterparts with global VL alignment. Compared to vanilla CLIP, CT-GLIP achieves average performance improvements of 15.1% of F1 score, 1.9% of AUC, and 3.2% of DSC for zero-shot AD, TD, and TS tasks, respectively. This study highlights the significance of grounded VL alignment in enabling 3D medical VL foundation models to understand sparse representations within CT scans.

<title>Pre-trained Language Models Improve the Few-shot Prompt Ability of Decision Transformer</title>

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT) has emerged as a promising class of algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, leveraging pre-collected datasets and Transformer's capability to model long sequences. Recent works have demonstrated that using parts of trajectories from training tasks as prompts in DT enhances its performance on unseen tasks, giving rise to Prompt-DT methods. However, collecting data from specific environments can be both costly and unsafe in many scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance and limited few-shot prompt abilities due to the data-hungry nature of Transformer-based models. Additionally, the limited datasets used in pre-training make it challenging for Prompt-DT type of methods to distinguish between various RL tasks through prompts alone. To address these challenges, we introduce the Language model-initialized Prompt Decision Transformer (LPDT) framework, which leverages pretrained language models providing rich prior knowledge for RL tasks and fine-tunes the sequence model using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) for meta-RL problems. We further incorporate prompt regularization to effectively differentiate between tasks based on prompt feature representations. Comprehensive empirical studies demonstrate that initializing with a pre-trained language model provides the prior knowledge and achieves a similar performance with Prompt-DT under only $10\%$ data in some MuJoCo control tasks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to validate the effectiveness of each component, including sequence modeling, language models, prompt regularizations, and prompt strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in symbol processing through in-context learning (ICL). This success flies in the face of decades of critiques asserting that artificial neural networks cannot master abstract symbol manipulation. We seek to understand the mechanisms that can enable robust symbol processing in transformer networks, illuminating both the unanticipated success, and the significant limitations, of transformers in symbol processing. Borrowing insights from symbolic AI and cognitive science on the power of Production System architectures, we develop a high-level Production System Language, PSL, that allows us to write symbolic programs to do complex, abstract symbol processing, and create compilers that precisely implement PSL programs in transformer networks which are, by construction, 100% mechanistically interpretable. The work is driven by study of a purely abstract (semantics-free) symbolic task that we develop, Templatic Generation (TGT). Although developed through study of TGT, PSL is, we demonstrate, highly general: it is Turing Universal. The new type of transformer architecture that we compile from PSL programs suggests a number of paths for enhancing transformers' capabilities at symbol processing. We note, however, that the work we report addresses computability, and not learnability, by transformer networks.
  Note: The first section provides an extended synopsis of the entire paper.

<title>BountyBench: Dollar Impact of AI Agent Attackers and Defenders on Real-World Cybersecurity Systems</title>

arXiv:2505.15216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity landscape. Here, we introduce the first framework to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit (exploiting a given vulnerability), and Patch (patching a given vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages, setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which are vulnerabilities with monetary awards from \$10 to \$30,485, covering 9 of the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero day to exploiting a given vulnerability. We evaluate 10 agents: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI with o3-high and o4-mini, and custom agents with o3-high, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking, Qwen3 235B A22B, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek-R1. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing agents are Codex CLI: o3-high (12.5% on Detect, mapping to \$3,720; 90% on Patch, mapping to \$14,152), Custom Agent: Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (67.5% on Exploit), and Codex CLI: o4-mini (90% on Patch, mapping to \$14,422). Codex CLI: o3-high, Codex CLI: o4-mini, and Claude Code are more capable at defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90%, 90%, and 87.5%, compared to Exploit scores of 47.5%, 32.5%, and 57.5% respectively; while the custom agents are relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of 17.5-67.5% and Patch scores of 25-60%.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LMMs underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around 9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60 minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs, spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action, scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets, VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory augmentation module, which adaptively integrates question-relevant and spatiotemporally informative semantics from the cached full video context. In our experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple representative long video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

<title>HeavyWater and SimplexWater: Distortion-Free LLM Watermarks for Low-Entropy Next-Token Predictions</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens. LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -- such as coding -- where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks: HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks, demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i) eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates. It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared with existing methods.

Abstract: We explore Jouzu, a Japanese language learning application that integrates large language models with anime-inspired conversational agents. Designed to address challenges learners face in practicing natural and expressive dialogue, Jouzu combines stylized character personas with expressive text-to-speech to create engaging conversational scenarios. We conducted a two-week in-the-wild deployment with 52 Japanese learners to examine how such stylized agents influence engagement and learner experience. Our findings show that participants interacted frequently and creatively, with advanced learners demonstrating greater use of expressive forms. Participants reported that the anime-inspired style made practice more enjoyable and encouraged experimenting with different registers. We discuss how stylization shapes willingness to engage, the role of affect in sustaining practice, and design opportunities for culturally grounded conversational AI in computer-assisted language learning (CALL). By framing our findings as an exploration of design and engagement, we highlight opportunities for generalization beyond Japanese contexts and contribute to international HCI scholarship.

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks. Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains. This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system, an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities. Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to qualitative improvement.

Abstract: By integrating tools from external APIs, Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their promising capabilities in a diverse spectrum of complex real-world tasks. However, testing, evaluation, and analysis of LLM tool use remain in their early stages. Most existing benchmarks rely on manually collected test cases, many of which cannot be automatically checked for semantic correctness and instead depend on static methods such as string matching. Additionally, these benchmarks often overlook the complex interactions that occur between sequential API calls, which are common in real-world applications. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce StateGen, an automated framework designed to generate diverse coding tasks involving sequential API interactions. StateGen combines state-machine-based API constraint solving and validation, energy-based sampling, and control-flow injection to generate executable programs. These programs are then translated into human-like natural language task descriptions through a collaboration of two LLM agents. Utilizing StateGen, we construct StateEval, a benchmark encompassing 120 verified test cases spanning across three representative scenarios: Session Service, Tensor Operation, and ElevenLabs MCP. Experimental results confirm that StateGen can effectively generate challenging and realistic API-oriented tasks, highlighting areas for improvement in current LLMs incorporating APIs.We make our framework and benchmark publicly available to support future research.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) to evaluate model outputs at scale, but their assessments often diverge systematically from human judgments. We present Bridge, a unified statistical framework that explicitly bridges human and LLM evaluations under both absolute scoring and pairwise comparison paradigms. Bridge posits a latent human preference score for each prompt-response pair and models LLM deviations as linear transformations of covariates that capture sources of discrepancies. This offers a simple and principled framework for refining LLM ratings and characterizing systematic discrepancies between humans and LLMs. We provide an efficient fitting algorithm with asymptotic guarantees for statistical inference. Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot Arena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy, calibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps.

Abstract: Data scarcity remains one of the most limiting factors in driving progress in robotics. However, the amount of available robotics data in the wild is growing exponentially, creating new opportunities for large-scale data utilization. Reliable temporal task completion prediction could help automatically annotate and curate this data at scale. The Generative Value Learning (GVL) approach was recently proposed, leveraging the knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress from visual observations. Building upon GVL, we propose OpenGVL, a comprehensive benchmark for estimating task progress across diverse challenging manipulation tasks involving both robotic and human embodiments. We evaluate the capabilities of publicly available open-source foundation models, showing that open-source model families significantly underperform closed-source counterparts, achieving only approximately $70\%$ of their performance on temporal progress prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate how OpenGVL can serve as a practical tool for automated data curation and filtering, enabling efficient quality assessment of large-scale robotics datasets. We release the benchmark along with the complete codebase at \href{github.com/budzianowski/opengvl}{OpenGVL}.

<title>Tiny but Mighty: A Software-Hardware Co-Design Approach for Efficient Multimodal Inference on Battery-Powered Small Devices</title>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units. It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly 20.8 hours.

<div> automated theorem proving, large language models, formal reasoning, supervised fine-tuning, benchmark dataset  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper introduces Spark-Prover-X1, a 7-billion parameter large language model (LLM) developed to advance automated theorem proving by addressing the lack of diverse and high-quality formal language data. The training framework consists of three stages: first, continuous pre-training on a broad mathematical corpus enriched with innovative data tasks including a novel "Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-augmented state prediction" task to improve fine-grained reasoning abilities. Second, a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase within an expert iteration loop is employed to specialize both the Spark-Prover-X1-7B model and the companion Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B model. Third, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied to enhance the model’s problem-solving capabilities on the most difficult tasks. To support evaluation, the authors introduce ExamFormal-Bench, a new benchmark dataset of 402 formal problems that reflect real-world examination scenarios. Experimental results show that Spark-Prover-X1 achieves state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized open-source models in the "Whole-Proof Generation" paradigm. Notably, it solves 27 problems on PutnamBench (pass@32) and attains 24.0% pass rate on CombiBench (pass@32). The study demonstrates that combining diverse training data with a systematically refined training pipeline effectively boosts formal reasoning in lightweight LLMs. The authors plan to release both models and the benchmark dataset publicly in the near future. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in automated theorem proving, yet progress is often constrained by the scarcity of diverse and high-quality formal language data. To address this issue, we introduce Spark-Prover-X1, a 7B parameter model trained via an three-stage framework designed to unlock the reasoning potential of more accessible and moderately-sized LLMs. The first stage infuses deep knowledge through continuous pre-training on a broad mathematical corpus, enhanced by a suite of novel data tasks. Key innovation is a "CoT-augmented state prediction" task to achieve fine-grained reasoning. The second stage employs Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) within an expert iteration loop to specialize both the Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B models. Finally, a targeted round of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied to sharpen the prover's capabilities on the most challenging problems. To facilitate robust evaluation, particularly on problems from real-world examinations, we also introduce ExamFormal-Bench, a new benchmark dataset of 402 formal problems. Experimental results demonstrate that Spark-Prover achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly-sized open-source models within the "Whole-Proof Generation" paradigm. It shows exceptional performance on difficult competition benchmarks, notably solving 27 problems on PutnamBench (pass@32) and achieving 24.0\% on CombiBench (pass@32). Our work validates that this diverse training data and progressively refined training pipeline provides an effective path for enhancing the formal reasoning capabilities of lightweight LLMs. We will release both Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B, along with the ExamFormal-Bench dataset, in the near future.

<div> Keywords: black-box language models, follow-up questions, behavior prediction, adversarial manipulation, model differentiation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the challenge of reliably predicting the behavior of black-box language models (LLMs), which are often accessible only via closed-source APIs. The authors propose a novel method that involves asking follow-up questions to the LLM and using the probabilities of its responses as feature representations to train reliable predictors. They demonstrate that a simple linear model trained on these response probabilities can accurately predict the correctness of the LLM’s outputs on various question-answering and reasoning benchmarks. Remarkably, this black-box prediction approach can outperform white-box linear models that rely on internal activations or model internals. Additionally, the method effectively distinguishes between clean versions of LLMs and those adversarially influenced through system prompts that cause incorrect answers or buggy code generation. The approach also enables the identification of misrepresented models accessed through APIs by differentiating between different black-box LLMs. Overall, the study showcases the potential for monitoring and ensuring trustworthy behavior of black-box language models, which is crucial for their safe integration into larger, autonomous systems. <div>

Abstract: Reliably predicting the behavior of language models -- such as whether their outputs are correct or have been adversarially manipulated -- is a fundamentally challenging task. This is often made even more difficult as frontier language models are offered only through closed-source APIs, providing only black-box access. In this paper, we predict the behavior of black-box language models by asking follow-up questions and taking the probabilities of responses \emph{as} representations to train reliable predictors. We first demonstrate that training a linear model on these responses reliably and accurately predicts model correctness on question-answering and reasoning benchmarks. Surprisingly, this can \textit{even outperform white-box linear predictors} that operate over model internals or activations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these follow-up question responses can reliably distinguish between a clean version of an LLM and one that has been adversarially influenced via a system prompt to answer questions incorrectly or to introduce bugs into generated code. Finally, we show that they can also be used to differentiate between black-box LLMs, enabling the detection of misrepresented models provided through an API. Overall, our work shows promise in monitoring black-box language model behavior, supporting their deployment in larger, autonomous systems.

<div> arXiv, qualitative data analysis, inductive coding, large language models, human evaluation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper explores automating qualitative data analysis through inductive coding using large language models (LLMs), focusing on generating labels directly from data rather than relying on predefined categories. The study evaluates six open-source LLMs by comparing their coding performance against human experts. A unique finding is the contrasting performance patterns: humans excel at labeling complex sentences but have difficulty with simpler ones, whereas LLMs perform better on simpler sentences but struggle with complex ones. The authors also analyze systematic differences between labels produced by humans and LLMs in reference to a golden standard test set. Although human annotations sometimes diverge from the standard, they often receive higher subjective ratings from other human evaluators. Conversely, some LLM-generated labels align more closely with the golden standard but are rated less favorably by human experts. This highlights discrepancies between objective accuracy and perceived quality in qualitative coding tasks when comparing human and machine performance. The study provides insights into the complementary strengths and limitations of human coders and LLMs in inductive qualitative analysis. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the automation of qualitative data analysis, focusing on inductive coding using large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional approaches that rely on deductive methods with predefined labels, this research investigates the inductive process where labels emerge from the data. The study evaluates the performance of six open-source LLMs compared to human experts. As part of the evaluation, experts rated the perceived difficulty of the quotes they coded. The results reveal a peculiar dichotomy: human coders consistently perform well when labeling complex sentences but struggle with simpler ones, while LLMs exhibit the opposite trend. Additionally, the study explores systematic deviations in both human and LLM generated labels by comparing them to the golden standard from the test set. While human annotations may sometimes differ from the golden standard, they are often rated more favorably by other humans. In contrast, some LLMs demonstrate closer alignment with the true labels but receive lower evaluations from experts.

<div> Keywords: large language models, multi-agent interaction, coordination dynamics, semantic compression, emergent behaviors  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) coordinate in collaborative, multi-agent settings when treated as black-box agents, focusing on their interaction dynamics during an inductive coding task. The authors simulate 7,500 multi-agent, multi-round discussions, generating over 125,000 utterances that detail both the final annotations and the dialogue history. They introduce novel process-level metrics such as code stability, semantic self-consistency, lexical confidence, sentiment, and convergence to measure and track the coordination dynamics between LLM agents. By analyzing the evolving geometry of output embeddings, the researchers find that intrinsic dimensionality decreases over rounds, which they interpret as semantic compression occurring within the group’s communication. The experiments show that groups of LLMs not only converge lexically and semantically but also develop asymmetric influence patterns, suggesting that some agents play more dominant roles. Moreover, these agents exhibit negotiation-like behaviors even though they are not explicitly assigned roles or prompted to negotiate. This research highlights that black-box interaction analysis can effectively uncover emergent coordination strategies in multi-agent LLM systems, serving as a scalable complement to traditional internal probe-based interpretability methods. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in collaborative settings, yet little is known about how they coordinate when treated as black-box agents. We simulate 7500 multi-agent, multi-round discussions in an inductive coding task, generating over 125000 utterances that capture both final annotations and their interactional histories. We introduce process-level metrics: code stability, semantic self-consistency, and lexical confidence alongside sentiment and convergence measures, to track coordination dynamics. To probe deeper alignment signals, we analyze the evolving geometry of output embeddings, showing that intrinsic dimensionality declines over rounds, suggesting semantic compression. The results reveal that LLM groups converge lexically and semantically, develop asymmetric influence patterns, and exhibit negotiation-like behaviors despite the absence of explicit role prompting. This work demonstrates how black-box interaction analysis can surface emergent coordination strategies, offering a scalable complement to internal probe-based interpretability methods.

<div> Transformer models, BERT, sentence embeddings, dependency parse trees, Graph Matching Networks<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of creating efficient and accurate sentence embeddings for Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks. Traditional transformer-based models like BERT achieve high accuracy but come with the downside of extremely large parameter sizes and computational demands. The authors propose an alternative approach by explicitly incorporating linguistic structures—specifically dependency parse trees—into the embedding process. They extend Graph Matching Networks (GMN) to operate on these trees, resulting in a new model called Tree Matching Networks (TMN). TMN leverages prior encoded syntactic relationships, potentially improving learning efficiency by not having to infer all relationships from scratch. Experimental evaluation on the SNLI entailment task shows that TMN outperforms a comparable BERT-based model, achieving higher accuracy with significantly reduced memory usage and training time. However, both TMN and BERT struggle on the SemEval similarity task, highlighting limitations in current methods for this type of semantic similarity. The authors identify that while explicit structural models like TMN excel at comparable model scales compared to sequence-based models, the scalability is constrained by current aggregation techniques. To address this, the paper proposes a novel multi-headed attention aggregation method to improve scalability for future research and applications. <div>

Abstract: In creating sentence embeddings for Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, using transformer-based models like BERT leads to high accuracy, but require hundreds of millions of parameters. These models take in sentences as a sequence of tokens, and learn to encode the meaning of the sequence into embeddings such that those embeddings can be used reliably for NLI tasks. Essentially, every word is considered against every other word in the sequence, and the transformer model is able to determine the relationships between them, entirely from scratch. However, a model that accepts explicit linguistic structures like dependency parse trees may be able to leverage prior encoded information about these relationships, without having to learn them from scratch, thus improving learning efficiency. To investigate this, we adapt Graph Matching Networks (GMN) to operate on dependency parse trees, creating Tree Matching Networks (TMN). We compare TMN to a BERT based model on the SNLI entailment task and on the SemEval similarity task. TMN is able to achieve significantly better results with a significantly reduced memory footprint and much less training time than the BERT based model on the SNLI task, while both models struggled to preform well on the SemEval. Explicit structural representations significantly outperform sequence-based models at comparable scales, but current aggregation methods limit scalability. We propose multi-headed attention aggregation to address this limitation.

Abstract: Empirical grammar research has become increasingly data-driven, but the systematic analysis of annotated corpora still requires substantial methodological and technical effort. We explore how agentic large language models (LLMs) can streamline this process by reasoning over annotated corpora and producing interpretable, data-grounded answers to linguistic questions. We introduce an agentic framework for corpus-grounded grammatical analysis that integrates concepts such as natural-language task interpretation, code generation, and data-driven reasoning. As a proof of concept, we apply it to Universal Dependencies (UD) corpora, testing it on multilingual grammatical tasks inspired by the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS). The evaluation spans 13 word-order features and over 170 languages, assessing system performance across three complementary dimensions - dominant-order accuracy, order-coverage completeness, and distributional fidelity - which reflect how well the system generalizes, identifies, and quantifies word-order variations. The results demonstrate the feasibility of combining LLM reasoning with structured linguistic data, offering a first step toward interpretable, scalable automation of corpus-based grammatical inquiry.

<div> Keywords: Grammatical Error Correction, Indic Languages, Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models, Conservative Decoding, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of grammatical error correction (GEC) in Indic languages, which are characterized by limited annotated data, diverse scripts, and complex morphology. The authors propose an augmentation-free approach leveraging instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), specifically a 12-billion parameter GEMMA 3 model fine-tuned using parameter-efficient methods (PEFT) and Alpaca-style formatting in 4-bit precision. The decoding process is conservative and deterministic, guided by a lightweight normalizer that ensures minimal and meaning-preserving corrections. The inference mechanism uses fixed, language-specific prompts created from a deterministic error classifier’s taxonomy, label distributions, and precedence ordering derived from training data. Evaluated on Malayalam and Hindi using the official untuned GLEU metric, the system achieves competitive scores of 92.41 and 81.44, ranking sixth and third respectively among competitors. The results demonstrate that combining classifier-informed prompt design, adapter-based instruction tuning, and deterministic decoding yields a reproducible, computationally efficient alternative to traditional augmentation-heavy pipelines in Indic GEC. The study suggests potential directions for enhancing morphosyntactic constraint integration and emphasizes the importance of human-centered evaluation for conservative edits in future work. <div>

Abstract: Grammatical error correction for Indic languages faces limited supervision, diverse scripts, and rich morphology. We propose an augmentation-free setup that uses instruction-tuned large language models and conservative decoding. A 12B GEMMA 3 model is instruction-tuned in bnb 4-bit precision with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and Alpaca-style formatting. Decoding follows a deterministic, constraint-aware procedure with a lightweight normaliser that encourages minimal, meaning-preserving edits. We operationalise inference, subsequent to instruction fine-tuning (IFT), via a fixed, language-specific prompt directly synthesised from a deterministic error classifier's taxonomy, label distributions, and precedence ordering computed on the training corpus.
  Under the official untuned GLEU evaluation, the system scores 92.41 on Malayalam, sixth overall, and 81.44 on Hindi, third overall. These results indicate that classifier-informed prompt design, adapter-based instruction tuning, and deterministic decoding provide a reproducible and a computationally efficient alternative to augmentation-centred pipelines for Indic GEC. The approach also motivates future work on stronger morphosyntactic constraints and human-centred evaluation of conservative edits.

<title>OmniFusion: Simultaneous Multilingual Multimodal Translations via Modular Fusion</title>

<div> Keywords: multimodal translation, large language models, speech translation, simultaneous translation, model fusion<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the limitation of current open-source text-only large language models (LLMs) for speech translation (ST), which rely on cascaded pipelines that perform automatic speech recognition before translation, causing increased latency especially problematic for simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). The authors highlight that existing pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) have robust perception and reasoning capabilities across modalities but lack multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance. To overcome these challenges, they propose OmniFusion, an end-to-end system that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs via a novel fusion strategy connecting multiple hidden layers of the MMFM to the translation LLM. This architecture enables joint training and multimodal context utilization, including audio and images, for enhanced disambiguation. Built using Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, OmniFusion supports speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniFusion reduces latency by one second in SimulST compared to conventional cascaded pipelines and significantly improves translation quality. The approach presents a notable advancement for efficient and accurate multimodal multilingual translation systems. The code is publicly available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: There has been significant progress in open-source text-only translation large language models (LLMs) with better language coverage and quality. However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicated translation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose an end-to-end approach that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs. We introduce a novel fusion strategy that connects hidden states from multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enabling joint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can perform speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that OmniFusion effectively leverages both audio and visual inputs, achieves a 1-second latency reduction in SimulST compared to cascaded pipelines and also improves the overall translation quality\footnote{Code is available at https://github.com/saikoneru/OmniFusion}.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Indic languages, mood states, translation, mental health<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Background: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold potential for psychiatric applications but primarily focus on English, which limits their effectiveness in understanding mood states expressed in other languages, particularly those with unique idioms of distress like Indic languages.<br />2. Aim: The study aimed to assess how well language models can represent idiomatic phrases describing four mood states—depression, euthymia, euphoric mania, and dysphoric mania—across 11 Indian languages.<br />3. Methods: A dataset of 247 unique mood state phrases was compiled. Seven experimental conditions were tested using k-means clustering on embeddings from (a) native and Romanised Indic scripts with multilingual and Indic-specific models and (b) translated phrases in English and Chinese.<br />4. Results: Direct embeddings of Indic languages failed to cluster mood states effectively (Composite Score=0.002). Translation-based approaches showed marked improvement, notably Gemini-translated English (0.60), human-translated English (0.61), and human-translated English further translated to Chinese and embedded with a Chinese model (best score 0.67). Specialized Indic models like IndicBERT and Sarvam-M performed poorly.<br />5. Conclusion: Current LLMs cannot reliably represent mood states directly from Indic languages, limiting psychiatric use in India. High-quality translation helps but depends on proprietary models and complex pipelines. To advance global mental health care, native understanding of diverse local languages in LLMs is essential. <div>
arXiv:2512.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Large Language Models show promise in psychiatry but are English-centric. Their ability to understand mood states in other languages is unclear, as different languages have their own idioms of distress. Aim: To quantify the ability of language models to faithfully represent phrases (idioms of distress) of four distinct mood states (depression, euthymia, euphoric mania, dysphoric mania) expressed in Indian languages. Methods: We collected 247 unique phrases for the four mood states across 11 Indic languages. We tested seven experimental conditions, comparing k-means clustering performance on: (a) direct embeddings of native and Romanised scripts (using multilingual and Indic-specific models) and (b) embeddings of phrases translated to English and Chinese. Performance was measured using a composite score based on Adjusted Rand Index, Normalised Mutual Information, Homogeneity and Completeness. Results: Direct embedding of Indic languages failed to cluster mood states (Composite Score = 0.002). All translation-based approaches showed significant improvement. High performance was achieved using Gemini-translated English (Composite=0.60) and human-translated English (Composite=0.61) embedded with gemini-001. Surprisingly, human-translated English, further translated into Chinese and embedded with a Chinese model, performed best (Composite = 0.67). Specialised Indic models (IndicBERT and Sarvam-M) performed poorly. Conclusion: Current models cannot meaningfully represent mood states directly from Indic languages, posing a fundamental barrier to their psychiatric application for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in India. While high-quality translation bridges this gap, reliance on proprietary models or complex translation pipelines is unsustainable. Models must first be built to understand diverse local languages to be effective in global mental health.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, EduEval, Chinese K-12 Education, Cognitive Framework, Benchmarking<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces EduEval, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in the context of Chinese K-12 education. First, it proposes the EduAbility Taxonomy, a cognitive framework combining Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth of Knowledge to categorize tasks into six cognitive dimensions: Memorization, Understanding, Application, Reasoning, Creativity, and Ethics. Second, the benchmark emphasizes authenticity by incorporating real exam questions, classroom dialogues, student essays, and expert-generated prompts to simulate genuine educational challenges. Third, EduEval is extensive in scale, containing 24 different task types and over 11,000 questions that cover primary through high school levels. The authors assess 14 leading LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot settings, finding that while these models excel at factual recall, they face difficulties in classroom dialogue classification and show inconsistent performance on creative content generation. Notably, several open-source models outperform proprietary ones on complex reasoning tasks relevant to education. Additionally, the efficacy of few-shot prompting varies significantly across the cognitive dimensions, indicating the need for customized strategies depending on educational goals. The study provides targeted metrics and insights for further development of LLMs tailored to diverse Chinese educational applications. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for educational applications. However, their unscrutinized deployment poses risks to educational standards, underscoring the need for rigorous evaluation. We introduce EduEval, a comprehensive hierarchical benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Chinese K-12 education. This benchmark makes three key contributions: (1) Cognitive Framework: We propose the EduAbility Taxonomy, which unifies Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth of Knowledge to organize tasks across six cognitive dimensions including Memorization, Understanding, Application, Reasoning, Creativity, and Ethics. (2) Authenticity: Our benchmark integrates real exam questions, classroom conversation, student essays, and expert-designed prompts to reflect genuine educational challenges; (3) Scale: EduEval comprises 24 distinct task types with over 11,000 questions spanning primary to high school levels. We evaluate 14 leading LLMs under both zero-shot and few-shot settings, revealing that while models perform well on factual tasks, they struggle with classroom dialogue classification and exhibit inconsistent results in creative content generation. Interestingly, several open source models outperform proprietary systems on complex educational reasoning. Few-shot prompting shows varying effectiveness across cognitive dimensions, suggesting that different educational objectives require tailored approaches. These findings provide targeted benchmarking metrics for developing LLMs specifically optimized for diverse Chinese educational tasks.

<div> Context-based question answering, CBQA models, Hugging Face, SQuAD, Genetic algorithm<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This manuscript benchmarks the performance of 47 context-based question answering (CBQA) models from Hugging Face across eight diverse datasets, aiming to identify the best-performing model without additional fine-tuning. Such benchmarking is crucial for practical implementations where retraining for specific datasets is minimized. It was found that the top models were trained on the SQuAD v1 or SQuAD v2 datasets. The best model overall was ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512, achieving 43% accuracy over all datasets. Performance analyses revealed that computation time depends on both context length and model size, while accuracy often decreases with longer answers. Additionally, model performance is affected by the complexity of the context. The study also employed a Genetic algorithm to enhance overall accuracy by integrating responses from multiple models. Specific performance highlights for ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 include 65.92% accuracy on bioasq10b-factoid, 96.45% on biomedical_cpgQA, 11.13% on QuAC, and 41.6% on the Question Answer Dataset. Separately, bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad achieved 82% accuracy on the IELTS dataset, demonstrating model-specific strengths depending on the dataset type. <div>

Abstract: Context-based question answering (CBQA) models provide more accurate and relevant answers by considering the contextual information. They effectively extract specific information given a context, making them functional in various applications involving user support, information retrieval, and educational platforms. In this manuscript, we benchmarked the performance of 47 CBQA models from Hugging Face on eight different datasets. This study aims to identify the best-performing model across diverse datasets without additional fine-tuning. It is valuable for practical applications where the need to retrain models for specific datasets is minimized, streamlining the implementation of these models in various contexts. The best-performing models were trained on the SQuAD v2 or SQuAD v1 datasets. The best-performing model was ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512, which yielded 43\% accuracy across all datasets. We observed that the computation time of all models depends on the context length and the model size. The model's performance usually decreases with an increase in the answer length. Moreover, the model's performance depends on the context complexity. We also used the Genetic algorithm to improve the overall accuracy by integrating responses from other models. ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 generated the best results for bioasq10b-factoid (65.92\%), biomedical\_cpgQA (96.45\%), QuAC (11.13\%), and Question Answer Dataset (41.6\%). Bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad achieved an accuracy of 82\% on the IELTS dataset.

<div> Keywords: temporal reasoning, semi-structured tables, SQL queries, schema normalization, QA precision<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of temporal reasoning over evolving semi-structured tables in question answering (QA) systems.<br /><br />2. The authors propose a SQL-based methodology consisting of three steps: generating a third normal form (3NF) schema from Wikipedia infoboxes, generating SQL queries based on that schema, and executing these queries for answer retrieval.<br /><br />3. A key finding is that the quality of schema design significantly influences QA precision more than increasing model capacity, challenging current assumptions favoring larger models.<br /><br />4. The study establishes three principles for effective schema design: normalization that preserves the contextual integrity of data, semantic naming conventions that minimize ambiguity, and consistent temporal anchoring to maintain temporal relevance.<br /><br />5. The best performing system, combining the Gemini 2.5 Flash schema with Gemini-2.0-Flash generated queries, achieved an exact match (EM) score of 80.39, representing a 16.8% improvement over the baseline EM of 68.89.<br /><br />This work highlights the critical role of thoughtful schema design in improving temporal QA over semi-structured data, suggesting that careful database normalization and query generation strategies can outperform simply scaling model size. <div>

Abstract: Temporal reasoning over evolving semi-structured tables poses a challenge to current QA systems. We propose a SQL-based approach that involves (1) generating a 3NF schema from Wikipedia infoboxes, (2) generating SQL queries, and (3) query execution. Our central finding challenges model scaling assumptions: the quality of schema design has a greater impact on QA precision than model capacity. We establish three evidence-based principles: normalization that preserves context, semantic naming that reduces ambiguity, and consistent temporal anchoring. Our best configuration (Gemini 2.5 Flash schema + Gemini-2.0-Flash queries) achieves 80.39 EM, a 16.8\% improvement over the baseline (68.89 EM).

<div> Multi-turn tool-calling, Assertion-Conditioned Compliance, user-sourced assertions, function-sourced assertions, model robustness<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses multi-turn tool-calling large language models (LLMs) that enable AI assistants to invoke external APIs or tools across several user interactions, which are essential for both simple and critical tasks in industries like business, medicine, and finance.<br /><br />2. Despite advances demonstrated by benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) and models like Salesforce's xLAM V2, concerns remain about LLMs' robustness in real-world, multi-turn dialogue settings, especially for safety-critical applications.<br /><br />3. The authors introduce a new evaluation framework called Assertion-Conditioned Compliance (A-CC), which measures model behavior in multi-turn function-calling contexts when faced with potentially misleading assertions.<br /><br />4. A-CC evaluates model vulnerability across two key assertion types: user-sourced assertions (USAs), which assess a model's tendency to agree with plausible but incorrect user beliefs, and function-sourced assertions (FSAs), which test compliance with plausible yet contradictory policies originating from outdated or conflicting system tools.<br /><br />5. Experiments demonstrate that current models show significant susceptibility to both sycophancy towards USAs and conflict compliance with FSAs, highlighting a critical, previously underexplored weakness in deployed AI agents that could impact trust and safety. <div>

Abstract: Multi-turn tool-calling LLMs (models capable of invoking external APIs or tools across several user turns) have emerged as a key feature in modern AI assistants, enabling extended dialogues from benign tasks to critical business, medical, and financial operations. Yet implementing multi-turn pipelines remains difficult for many safety-critical industries due to ongoing concerns regarding model resilience. While standardized benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) have underpinned confidence concerning advanced function-calling models (like Salesforce's xLAM V2), there is still a lack of visibility into multi-turn conversation-level robustness, especially given their exposure to real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce Assertion-Conditioned Compliance (A-CC), a novel evaluation paradigm for multi-turn function-calling dialogues. A-CC provides holistic metrics that evaluate a model's behavior when confronted with misleading assertions originating from two distinct vectors: (1) user-sourced assertions (USAs), which measure sycophancy toward plausible but misinformed user beliefs, and (2) function-sourced assertions (FSAs), which measure compliance with plausible but contradictory system policies (e.g., stale hints from unmaintained tools). Our results show that models are highly vulnerable to both USA sycophancy and FSA policy conflicts, confirming A-CC as a critical, latent vulnerability in deployed agents.

<div> Keywords: IndicParam, low-resource Indic languages, large language models, multilingual benchmark, question format diversity<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces IndicParam, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 13,000 human-curated multiple-choice questions spanning 11 low- and extremely low-resource Indic languages, including Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Dogri, Maithili, Rajasthani, Sanskrit, Bodo, Santali, Konkani, plus a Sanskrit-English code-mixed set. The study evaluates 19 large language models (LLMs), both proprietary and open-weight, highlighting that even the best performer, GPT-5, achieves only 45.0% average accuracy, followed closely by DeepSeek-3.2 (43.1%) and Claude-4.5 (42.7%). Each question is annotated to distinguish between knowledge-oriented items and purely linguistic ones, allowing differentiation between factual recall and grammatical skills. The benchmark also tests LLM capabilities across various question formats beyond traditional multiple-choice, including list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering. Findings reveal significant limitations of current cross-lingual transfer techniques for Indic languages, underscoring the challenge these languages pose for LLMs. IndicParam aims to push forward research in this area by providing a rigorous and diverse testing ground for future multilingual model development. The dataset and evaluation scripts are publicly accessible for further research and development at the provided Hugging Face and GitHub links. <div>

Abstract: While large language models excel on high-resource multilingual tasks, low- and extremely low-resource Indic languages remain severely under-evaluated. We present IndicParam, a human-curated benchmark of over 13,000 multiple-choice questions covering 11 such languages (Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia as low-resource; Dogri, Maithili, Rajasthani, Sanskrit, Bodo, Santali, Konkani as extremely low-resource) plus Sanskrit-English code-mixed set. We evaluated 19 LLMs, both proprietary and open-weights, which reveals that even the top-performing GPT-5 reaches only 45.0% average accuracy, followed by DeepSeek-3.2 (43.1) and Claude-4.5 (42.7). We additionally label each question as knowledge-oriented or purely linguistic to discriminate factual recall from grammatical proficiency. Further, we assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside conventional multiple-choice questions. IndicParam provides insights into limitations of cross-lingual transfer and establishes a challenging benchmark for Indic languages. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/bharatgenai/IndicParam. Scripts to run benchmark are present at https://github.com/ayushbits/IndicParam.

<div> Keywords: timestamped question answering, educational lecture videos, CrossFusion-RAG, latency-constrained retrieval, temporal consistency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the problem of timestamped question answering over educational lecture videos within strict latency and memory constraints suitable for a single GPU. The authors introduce CourseTimeQA, a dataset consisting of 52.3 hours of video content and 902 queries spanning six courses, designed to benchmark retrieval and answer synthesis performance. They propose CrossFusion-RAG, a lightweight cross-modal retriever architecture that leverages frozen encoders combined with a learned vision projection (512→768 dimensions), shallow query-agnostic cross-attention mechanisms over ASR (automatic speech recognition) and video frames, and a temporal-consistency regularizer to enhance robustness in temporal localization. A small cross-attentive reranker further refines retrieval quality. CrossFusion-RAG demonstrates significant performance improvements over a strong BLIP-2 baseline retriever in terms of nDCG@10 (+0.10) and MRR (+0.08) while maintaining a median end-to-end latency of approximately 1.55 seconds on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. The study includes comprehensive comparisons against competitive baselines such as zero-shot CLIP multi-frame pooling, CLIP combined with cross-encoder reranking and MMR, learned late-fusion gating, text-only hybrid retrieval methods, caption-augmented text retrieval, and non-learned temporal smoothing, all evaluated under matched hardware and indexing conditions. Additional analyses assess robustness against ASR noise (quantified by word error rate quartiles) and provide diagnostic evaluations of temporal localization accuracy. Full training and tuning details are made available to facilitate reproducibility and benchmarking across future research. <div>

Abstract: We study timestamped question answering over educational lecture videos under a single-GPU latency/memory budget. Given a natural-language query, the system retrieves relevant timestamped segments and synthesizes a grounded answer. We present CourseTimeQA (52.3 h, 902 queries across six courses) and a lightweight, latency-constrained cross-modal retriever (CrossFusion-RAG) that combines frozen encoders, a learned 512->768 vision projection, shallow query-agnostic cross-attention over ASR and frames with a temporal-consistency regularizer, and a small cross-attentive reranker. On CourseTimeQA, CrossFusion-RAG improves nDCG@10 by 0.10 and MRR by 0.08 over a strong BLIP-2 retriever while achieving approximately 1.55 s median end-to-end latency on a single A100. Closest comparators (zero-shot CLIP multi-frame pooling; CLIP + cross-encoder reranker + MMR; learned late-fusion gating; text-only hybrid with cross-encoder reranking and its MMR variant; caption-augmented text retrieval; non-learned temporal smoothing) are evaluated under matched hardware and indexing. We report robustness across ASR noise (WER quartiles), diagnostics for temporal localization, and full training/tuning details to support reproducible comparison.

<title>Mitigating the Threshold Priming Effect in Large Language Model-Based Relevance Judgments via Personality Infusing</title>

<div> Keywords: LLMs, priming effects, Big Five personality, relevance labeling, personality prompting<br /><br />Summary: This study investigates the influence of simulated Big Five personality profiles in Large Language Models (LLMs) on the phenomenon of priming in relevance labeling tasks. Priming effects occur when prior relevance judgments bias subsequent ones, a challenge for the reliability of LLM-based evaluations. The research utilizes multiple LLMs and evaluates their performance on the TREC 2021 and 2022 Deep Learning Track datasets. Results reveal that certain personality traits, notably High Openness and Low Neuroticism, consistently reduce priming susceptibility, suggesting that these traits can serve as mitigating factors against bias. However, the study also finds variability in which personality profile is most effective, depending on the specific LLM and the nature of the task. By linking psychological theories about personality and cognitive biases with LLM behavior, the authors propose "personality prompting" as a novel method to control and reduce threshold priming effects. This approach represents a promising connection between human psychological insights and the operational tuning of LLMs for improved evaluation accuracy and robustness in relevance labeling scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2512.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has explored LLMs as scalable tools for relevance labeling, but studies indicate they are susceptible to priming effects, where prior relevance judgments influence later ones. Although psychological theories link personality traits to such biases, it is unclear whether simulated personalities in LLMs exhibit similar effects. We investigate how Big Five personality profiles in LLMs influence priming in relevance labeling, using multiple LLMs on TREC 2021 and 2022 Deep Learning Track datasets. Our results show that certain profiles, such as High Openness and Low Neuroticism, consistently reduce priming susceptibility. Additionally, the most effective personality in mitigating priming may vary across models and task types. Based on these findings, we propose personality prompting as a method to mitigate threshold priming, connecting psychological evidence with LLM-based evaluation practices.

<div> Keywords: AI-assisted error analysis, Large Language Models, linguistic taxonomy, English writing errors, EFL instruction<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study presents the development of an AI-assisted error analysis system aimed at identifying, categorizing, and correcting English writing errors. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet and DeepSeek R1 to analyze errors based on a detailed taxonomy inspired by linguistic theories from Corder (1967), Richards (1971), and James (1998). Errors are classified at both the word and sentence levels, addressing spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues. The implementation uses Python-coded API calls, enabling the system to provide nuanced feedback beyond traditional rubric-based assessments. Initial testing focused on isolated errors facilitated refining the taxonomy and resolving challenges related to overlapping error categories. Final evaluation utilized the 1855 text "English as she is spoke" by Jose da Fonseca, which contains authentic and complex linguistic errors, to test the system’s multi-layered analytical capabilities. The AI demonstrated success in identifying various error types but showed limitations in contextual understanding and occasionally introduced new error categories when encountering unclassified errors. The research highlights AI’s potential to revolutionize EFL instruction through automated and detailed error feedback, while noting the necessity for further improvements in contextual accuracy and expansion into stylistic and discourse-level error analysis. <div>

Initial testing on isolated errors refined the taxonomy, addressing challenges like overlapping categories. Final testing used "English as she is spoke" by Jose da Fonseca (1855), a text rich with authentic linguistic errors, to evaluate the system's capacity for handling complex, multi-layered analysis. The AI successfully identified diverse error types but showed limitations in contextual understanding and occasionally generated new error categories when encountering uncoded errors. This research demonstrates AI's potential to transform EFL instruction by automating detailed error analysis and feedback. While promising, further development is needed to improve contextual accuracy and expand the taxonomy to stylistic and discourse-level errors.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: CryptoBench, Large Language Models, cryptocurrency, benchmark, predictive analysis<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces CryptoBench, the first expert-curated and dynamic benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) agents in the cryptocurrency domain, a field characterized by extreme time sensitivity, adversarial information environments, and the need for data synthesis from diverse specialized sources like on-chain intelligence and DeFi dashboards. Unlike general-purpose benchmarks, CryptoBench consists of 50 real-world questions monthly, designed by crypto-native professionals to reflect authentic analyst workflows. Tasks are categorized into four quadrants—Simple Retrieval, Complex Retrieval, Simple Prediction, and Complex Prediction—allowing detailed assessment of both foundational data gathering and advanced analytical and forecasting skills of LLM agents. The authors evaluated ten LLMs in direct and agentic frameworks, revealing a clear performance hierarchy. A significant finding is the "retrieval-prediction imbalance," where many top models excel at factual data retrieval but show weaknesses in predictive analysis, indicating agents may appear factually grounded yet lack deeper analytical synthesis capabilities. This benchmark offers a challenging and valuable scenario that better measures real-world LLM competence in professional crypto analysis than existing benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces CryptoBench, the first expert-curated, dynamic benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the real-world capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in the uniquely demanding and fast-paced cryptocurrency domain. Unlike general-purpose agent benchmarks for search and prediction, professional crypto analysis presents specific challenges: \emph{extreme time-sensitivity}, \emph{a highly adversarial information environment}, and the critical need to synthesize data from \emph{diverse, specialized sources}, such as on-chain intelligence platforms and real-time Decentralized Finance (DeFi) dashboards. CryptoBench thus serves as a much more challenging and valuable scenario for LLM agent assessment. To address these challenges, we constructed a live, dynamic benchmark featuring 50 questions per month, expertly designed by crypto-native professionals to mirror actual analyst workflows. These tasks are rigorously categorized within a four-quadrant system: Simple Retrieval, Complex Retrieval, Simple Prediction, and Complex Prediction. This granular categorization enables a precise assessment of an LLM agent's foundational data-gathering capabilities alongside its advanced analytical and forecasting skills.
  Our evaluation of ten LLMs, both directly and within an agentic framework, reveals a performance hierarchy and uncovers a failure mode. We observe a \textit{retrieval-prediction imbalance}, where many leading models, despite being proficient at data retrieval, demonstrate a pronounced weakness in tasks requiring predictive analysis. This highlights a problematic tendency for agents to appear factually grounded while lacking the deeper analytical capabilities to synthesize information.

<title>SCALE: Selective Resource Allocation for Overcoming Performance Bottlenecks in Mathematical Test-time Scaling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00466</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00466</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: test-time compute scaling, large language models, selective resource allocation, problem difficulty assessment, dual-process theory<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses limitations in current test-time compute scaling methods used to enhance mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), where uniform allocation of resources across all sub-problems leads to inefficiencies and performance bottlenecks.<br /><br />2. The authors introduce SCALE (Selective Resource Allocation), a novel framework inspired by dual-process theory that dynamically allocates computational resources depending on the difficulty of each reasoning sub-problem.<br /><br />3. SCALE comprises four stages: decomposition of the original problem into sequential sub-problems, assessment of each sub-problem’s difficulty to classify it as routine or challenging, selective assignment of processing mode—System 1 for simple tasks and System 2 for complex ones—and sequential execution with context propagation.<br /><br />4. By focusing heavier computational effort on challenging sub-problems while efficiently handling routine operations, SCALE improves both resource utilization and reasoning accuracy.<br /><br />5. Experimental results demonstrate that SCALE significantly outperforms uniform scaling methods, achieving up to a 13.75 percentage point increase in accuracy on the AIME25 benchmark (from 57.50% to 71.25%), while simultaneously reducing computational cost by 33%-53%, marking a substantial advance in test-time compute scaling for LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2512.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computational resources during inference. However, current methods employ uniform resource distribution across all reasoning sub-problems, creating fundamental bottlenecks where challenging sub-problems receive insufficient attention while routine operations consume disproportionate resources. This uniform allocation creates performance bottlenecks where additional computational resources yield diminishing returns. Inspired by dual-process theory, we propose \textbf{SCALE} (Selective Resource Allocation), a framework that selectively allocates computational resources based on sub-problem difficulty. SCALE operates through four stages: (1) problem decomposition into sequential reasoning sub-problems, (2) difficulty assessment of each sub-problem to distinguish between routine operations and computationally challenging sub-problems, (3) selective processing mode assignment between System 1 for simple sub-problems and System 2 for complex ones, and (4) sequential execution with context propagation. By concentrating resources on challenging sub-problems while processing routine operations efficiently, SCALE achieves substantial performance improvements with superior resource utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCALE significantly outperforms uniform scaling baselines, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 13.75 percentage points (57.50% to 71.25% on AIME25) while reducing computational costs by 33%-53%, representing a major advance in test-time scaling that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.

<title>CACARA: Cross-Modal Alignment Leveraging a Text-Centric Approach for Cost-Effective Multimodal and Multilingual Learning</title>

<div> Multimodal learning, Multilingual models, Emergent alignment, Efficient training, Audio-text retrieval<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces CACARA, a novel multimodal and multilingual architecture that leverages emergent alignment learning to integrate new data modalities into existing multimodal models efficiently, eliminating the need for resource-heavy full retraining. Unlike traditional methods that require extensive training across all modalities and languages, CACARA supports the seamless addition of new modalities by fine-tuning only on data aligned with the English language. Remarkably, this approach enables the model to acquire multilingual capabilities, supporting over 100 languages, despite training on monolingual text data only and without modifying the text encoder. The emergent alignment paradigm preserves previously learned knowledge while achieving a training cost comparable to monolingual models. Experimentally, CACARA demonstrates significant performance gains, achieving up to 14.24 percentage points improvement in R@1 audio-to-text retrieval, surpassing state-of-the-art multimodal models. This work highlights a scalable, cost-effective pathway for expanding multimodal models across languages and modalities, advancing the integration of complex, diverse data types in deep learning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2512.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As deep learning models evolve, new applications and challenges are rapidly emerging. Tasks that once relied on a single modality, such as text, images, or audio, are now enriched by seamless interactions between multimodal data. These connections bridge information gaps: an image can visually materialize a text, while audio can add context to an image. Researchers have developed numerous multimodal models, but most rely on resource-intensive training across multiple modalities. Similarly, extending these models to new languages often follows the same resource-heavy training strategy. In this work, we propose a multimodal and multilingual architecture, CACARA, trained through emergent alignment learning, enabling the seamless integration of new modalities into an existing bimodal/multimodal model without requiring full retraining. This work breaks new ground by demonstrating that this emergent alignment paradigm can unlock multilingual capabilities from monolingual training. By fine-tuning the newly incorporated modality only on data aligned with the English language, our model develops support for over 100 languages without explicit multilingual pretraining or tuning of the text encoder. Such emergent multimodal and multilingual properties are gained efficiently, preserving previously learned knowledge at a training cost comparable to that of a monolingual model. Our strategy achieves up to a 14.24 percentage points improvement in R@1 audio-to-text retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal models -- all without the heavy computational cost of retraining across every modality and language.

<div> KV cache compression, global scoring, reinforcement learning, knowledge distillation, large language models<br /><br />Summary: Recent large language models (LLMs) capable of complex reasoning face substantial computational and memory challenges due to the processing of long input sequences. To improve efficiency, KV cache compression has been adopted, which reduces memory usage during attention computation by compressing stored key-value pairs. Existing approaches primarily focus on prompt compression or token eviction strategies based on local attention scores, which do not adequately capture the long-term importance of tokens. This paper proposes G-KV, a novel KV cache eviction method that integrates a global scoring mechanism by combining both local and historical attention scores, allowing a more accurate evaluation of token relevance over time. Furthermore, to enhance model performance with compressed KV caches, the authors introduce post-training optimization techniques including reinforcement learning and knowledge distillation. These methods help adapt the models to operate effectively in compressed settings without sacrificing accuracy. The combined approach of G-KV and the training techniques significantly improve efficiency and maintain reasoning capabilities of LLMs in handling long sequence inputs. The code for implementing G-KV is publicly available, facilitating further research and application in the area of efficient reasoning with LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks but encounter significant computational and memory challenges due to long sequence lengths. KV cache compression has emerged as an effective approach to greatly enhance the efficiency of reasoning. However, existing methods often focus on prompt compression or token eviction with local attention score, overlooking the long-term importance of tokens. We propose G-KV, a KV cache eviction method that employs a global scoring mechanism, combining local and historical attention scores to more accurately assess token importance. Additionally, we introduce post-training techniques, including reinforcement learning and distillation, to optimize models for compressed KV cache settings.

<div> Keywords: sentiment analysis, Turkish, polarity lexicon, neural network, word embeddings<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />In this thesis, a comprehensive sentiment analysis framework was developed primarily for Turkish, with additional approaches specific to English. Five major and three minor contributions were made. First, a novel and effective feature set combining unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised metrics was generated, which, when used with classical machine learning methods, outperformed neural network models across multiple Turkish and English datasets. Second, a semi-supervised, domain-specific polarity lexicon was created for Turkish corpora, marking the first such method applied in this language. Third, fine morphological analysis was performed for Turkish sentiment classification by determining morpheme polarities, offering a method adaptable to other morphologically-rich or agglutinative languages. Fourth, a novel neural network architecture combining recurrent and recursive models was built for English sentiment analysis. Fifth, new word embeddings incorporating sentiment, syntactic, semantic, and lexical features were developed for both Turkish and English, including a redefinition of context windows as subclauses in English, applicable to other NLP tasks. Minor contributions included aspect-based sentiment methods for Turkish, parameter redefinition in semi-supervised approaches, and aspect term extraction techniques for English. This work represents the most detailed, comprehensive study on Turkish sentiment analysis as of July 2020 and advances opinion classification in English. <div>

Abstract: In this thesis, we developed a comprehensive framework for sentiment analysis that takes its many aspects into account mainly for Turkish. We have also proposed several approaches specific to sentiment analysis in English only. We have accordingly made five major and three minor contributions. We generated a novel and effective feature set by combining unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised metrics. We then fed them as input into classical machine learning methods, and outperformed neural network models for datasets of different genres in both Turkish and English. We created a polarity lexicon with a semi-supervised domain-specific method, which has been the first approach applied for corpora in Turkish. We performed a fine morphological analysis for the sentiment classification task in Turkish by determining the polarities of morphemes. This can be adapted to other morphologically-rich or agglutinative languages as well. We have built a novel neural network architecture, which combines recurrent and recursive neural network models for English. We built novel word embeddings that exploit sentiment, syntactic, semantic, and lexical characteristics for both Turkish and English. We also redefined context windows as subclauses in modelling word representations in English. This can also be applied to other linguistic fields and natural language processing tasks. We have achieved state-of-the-art and significant results for all these original approaches. Our minor contributions include methods related to aspect-based sentiment in Turkish, parameter redefinition in the semi-supervised approach, and aspect term extraction techniques for English. This thesis can be considered the most detailed and comprehensive study made on sentiment analysis in Turkish as of July, 2020. Our work has also contributed to the opinion classification problem in English.

<div> Mathematical reasoning, diagnostic framework, language models, reasoning fidelity, pattern matching  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper critiques the prevalent use of answer accuracy as the primary metric for evaluating mathematical reasoning in language models, highlighting how it can mask core logical computation failures. The authors introduce a novel diagnostic framework designed to differentiate genuine mathematical reasoning from superficial pattern matching using four axes: forward-backward consistency, transitivity coverage, counterfactual sensitivity, and perturbation robustness. Applying this framework to the Qwen3-0.6B model on the MenatQA dataset reveals significant discrepancies between conventional accuracy (over 70%) and deeper reasoning metrics like backward consistency (15%) and transitivity coverage (32.2%), exposing brittle sensitivity to input perturbations. These findings suggest the model’s reliance on pattern recognition rather than authentic logical processing. While the empirical study focuses on a single small-scale 600M-parameter model, the introduced diagnostic framework is model-agnostic and can be applied broadly across model types and sizes. The authors also provide their evaluation protocols publicly, encouraging the research community to adopt more rigorous assessments of reasoning fidelity. This work pushes beyond surface-level answer correctness to establish methods for verifiable and trustworthy mathematical reasoning evaluation in language models. <div>
arXiv:2512.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluation of mathematical reasoning in language models relies primarily on answer accuracy, potentially masking fundamental failures in logical computation. We introduce a diagnostic framework that distinguishes genuine mathematical reasoning from superficial pattern matching through four complementary axes: forward-backward consistency, transitivity coverage, counterfactual sensitivity, and perturbation robustness. Through a case study applying this framework to Qwen3-0.6B on the MenatQA dataset, we reveal a striking disconnect between surface performance and reasoning fidelity. While the model achieves reasonable answer accuracy (70%+), it demonstrates poor backward consistency (15%), limited transitivity coverage (32.2%), and brittle sensitivity to perturbations. Our diagnostics expose reasoning failures invisible to traditional accuracy metrics, suggesting that this small model relies heavily on pattern matching rather than genuine logical computation. While our empirical findings are based on a single 600M-parameter model, the diagnostic framework itself is model-agnostic and generalizable. We release our evaluation protocols to enable the research community to assess reasoning fidelity across different model scales and architectures, moving beyond surface-level accuracy toward verifiable mathematical reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Slovak language, dictionary tools, natural language processing, low-resourced languages, linguistic resources<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This article addresses the challenge of limited dictionary data availability in many languages, focusing on the Slovak language, which is considered low-resourced in terms of linguistic data.<br /><br />2. The authors introduce a new conceptual dictionary specifically designed for the Slovak language, marking the first linguistic tool of this kind for Slovak.<br /><br />3. This resource aims to support various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as those requiring lexicons, word form dictionaries, or knowledge bases, which are currently lacking in Slovak.<br /><br />4. The scarcity of machine-readable linguistic data for Slovak hinders automated processing tasks, resulting in weaker performance on these tasks compared to higher-resourced languages.<br /><br />5. By providing this new conceptual dictionary, the article contributes a foundational resource that is expected to improve NLP outcomes and enable easier automated processing of Slovak text in future research and applications. <div>
arXiv:2512.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When solving tasks in the field of natural language processing, we sometimes need dictionary tools, such as lexicons, word form dictionaries or knowledge bases. However, the availability of dictionary data is insufficient in many languages, especially in the case of low resourced languages. In this article, we introduce a new conceptual dictionary for the Slovak language as the first linguistic tool of this kind. Since Slovak language is a language with limited linguistic resources and there are currently not available any machine-readable linguistic data sources with a sufficiently large volume of data, many tasks which require automated processing of Slovak text achieve weaker results compared to other languages and are almost impossible to solve.

<div> Keywords: Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models, Wikontic, Knowledge Extraction, Benchmark Performance<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces Wikontic, a novel multi-stage pipeline designed to construct knowledge graphs (KGs) from open-domain text efficiently and accurately. The pipeline extracts candidate triplets with qualifiers, applies Wikidata-based constraints on types and relations, and performs entity normalization to reduce duplication, resulting in compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected KGs. Wikontic demonstrates excellent performance on multiple benchmarks: on MuSiQue, 96% of generated triplets contain the correct answer entity; on HotpotQA, its triplets-only approach achieves a 76.0 F1 score, and on MuSiQue, 59.8 F1, matching or exceeding retrieval-augmented generation baselines that rely on textual context. Additionally, Wikontic attains state-of-the-art information retention with an 86% score on the MINE-1 benchmark, surpassing previous KG construction methods. The system is highly efficient, requiring fewer than 1,000 output tokens for KG construction, which is about three times less than AriGraph and less than one-twentieth of GraphRAG. Overall, Wikontic improves the intrinsic quality of generated KGs and offers a scalable, effective solution for integrating structured knowledge into large language models. <div>
arXiv:2512.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured, verifiable grounding for large language models (LLMs), but current LLM-based systems commonly use KGs as auxiliary structures for text retrieval, leaving their intrinsic quality underexplored. In this work, we propose Wikontic, a multi-stage pipeline that constructs KGs from open-domain text by extracting candidate triplets with qualifiers, enforcing Wikidata-based type and relation constraints, and normalizing entities to reduce duplication. The resulting KGs are compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected; on MuSiQue, the correct answer entity appears in 96% of generated triplets. On HotpotQA, our triplets-only setup achieves 76.0 F1, and on MuSiQue 59.8 F1, matching or surpassing several retrieval-augmented generation baselines that still require textual context. In addition, Wikontic attains state-of-the-art information-retention performance on the MINE-1 benchmark (86%), outperforming prior KG construction methods. Wikontic is also efficient at build time: KG construction uses less than 1,000 output tokens, about 3$\times$ fewer than AriGraph and $<$1/20 of GraphRAG. The proposed pipeline enhances the quality of the generated KG and offers a scalable solution for leveraging structured knowledge in LLMs.

<div> Keywords: Prism, metalanguage, software agents, compositional grammar, tool-using agents  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Prism is a concise, compositional metalanguage designed for specifying the behavior of tool-using software agents. It avoids introducing arbitrary control constructs by centering around a fixed core context called Core1, which includes a minimal grammar with categories such as numbers, strings, user prompts, and tools, alongside abstract combinators for booleans, predicates, pairs, and lists. Agent policies are expressed as ordinary functional-style expressions using a single abstraction operator, where conditionals operate as selections between alternatives rather than imperative if-else statements. The language supports extensibility through domain-specific context mini-grammars that add new categories, predicates, and external tools while preserving the core's compositional framework. Demonstrated examples span various domains, including thermostat control, home security, e-commerce recommendation, and medical monitoring, illustrating how natural language decision rules can be translated into executable, inspectable policies. Linguistically, Prism enforces a clear separation of concerns by maintaining a reusable core grammar and domain-specific lexicons, treating external tools as interfaces connecting policies to the real world. From an engineering standpoint, Prism provides a compact, explicit interface language that facilitates analysis, verification, and enforcement of safety constraints on agent control actions. <div>

Abstract: Prism is a small, compositional metalanguage for specifying the behaviour of tool-using software agents. Rather than introducing ad hoc control constructs, Prism is built around a fixed core context, Core1, which provides a minimal background grammar of categories numbers, strings, user prompts, tools together with abstract combinators for booleans, predicates, pairs, and lists. Agent policies are written as ordinary expressions using a single abstraction operator so that conditionals appear as selections between alternatives instead of imperative if-else blocks. Domains extend the core by defining their own context-mini-grammars that introduce new categories, predicates, and external tools while reusing the same compositional machinery. We illustrate this with worked examples from thermostat control, home security, e-commerce recommendation, and medical monitoring, showing how natural language decision rules can be mapped to inspectable, executable policies. From a linguistic perspective, Prism enforces a clear separation between a reusable grammar-like core and domain specific lexicons and treats tools as bridges between internal policy representations and the external world. From an engineering perspective, it offers a compact interface language for agent control, making the space of possible actions explicit and amenable to analysis, verification, and safety constraints.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, ELO ranking, multi-agent reasoning, consensus responses, response accuracy  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces ART (Adaptive Response Tuning), a novel framework designed to improve the output quality of Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional single-model responses often show inconsistency, hallucination, and variable quality across different query domains. ART addresses these limitations by leveraging a tournament-style ELO ranking system combined with multi-agent reasoning. Multiple LLM agents compete, critique, and collaborate through structured tournament workflows to generate consensus responses that surpass individual model outputs. The framework includes configurable tournament parameters, dynamic agent selection, and several consensus fusion strategies, enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Experimental evaluations reveal significant improvements in response accuracy, coherence, and reliability when compared to baseline single-model approaches. ART achieves an 8.4% enhancement in overall quality metrics and demonstrates high reliability with R22 values exceeding 0.96 in ELO rating convergence. The framework is scalable and production-ready, making it suitable for real-world applications that demand high-quality and vetted LLM responses. Overall, ART provides a systematic and effective approach to optimizing LLM outputs by fostering competition and collaboration among multiple agents. <div>

<div> Keywords: sycophantic responses, Large Language Models, methodological challenges, human perception, AI alignment<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article addresses the phenomenon of sycophantic response patterns in Large Language Models (LLMs), which refers to the tendency of these models to provide overly agreeable or flattering answers. It reviews the existing methodological challenges involved in accurately measuring sycophancy in LLMs, emphasizing that there are five main operationalizations researchers currently use to define and evaluate this behavior. Although sycophancy is fundamentally a human-centered concept, the study points out that contemporary research often neglects to assess how humans perceive these sycophantic responses, thus missing a crucial part of understanding their impact. Additionally, the article discusses difficulties in clearly differentiating sycophantic responses from other related behaviors relevant to AI alignment, such as strategic responses or reward-seeking tendencies. To advance research in this area, the authors provide actionable recommendations aimed at refining measurement approaches, integrating human subjective evaluations, and clarifying conceptual boundaries. Overall, the paper contributes a critical examination of sycophancy in LLMs and highlights important directions for future investigations to better grasp and mitigate such response biases. <div>

Abstract: Sycophantic response patterns in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly claimed in the literature. We review methodological challenges in measuring LLM sycophancy and identify five core operationalizations. Despite sycophancy being inherently human-centric, current research does not evaluate human perception. Our analysis highlights the difficulties in distinguishing sycophantic responses from related concepts in AI alignment and offers actionable recommendations for future research.

<title>Graphing the Truth: Structured Visualizations for Automated Hallucination Detection in LLMs</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, hallucinations, visual knowledge graphs, human-in-the-loop, enterprise AI<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) when applied in enterprise contexts, where models are integrated with proprietary, closed-source domain knowledge. These hallucinations stem from operational constraints such as limited context windows and discrepancies between the model’s pre-training data and the injected knowledge, resulting in confident but erroneous outputs that often evade human detection. Existing mitigation methods rely on expensive gold-standard question-answer curation or secondary model verification, which lack deterministic guarantees of correctness. To overcome these issues, the authors propose a novel framework that represents proprietary knowledge and generated content as interactive visual knowledge graphs. This approach enables users to visually trace model assertions back to their verified sources, highlighting confidence levels and potential hallucination zones transparently. The visual interface supports diagnosis of inconsistencies and identification of weak reasoning chains. Crucially, it facilitates a human-in-the-loop workflow, allowing end users to provide corrective feedback that feeds back into the system. This structured feedback loop aims to improve overall model reliability and continuously enhance response quality, making the interaction with LLMs more trustworthy and controllable in enterprise applications. <div>
arXiv:2512.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models have rapidly advanced in their ability to interpret and generate natural language. In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\&amp;A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.

<div> Keywords: ChatGPT, GPT-4, nuanced language, classification, performance evaluation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper evaluates the performance of GPT-4, along with ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4o, in the complex task of classifying and annotating datasets containing nuanced language. The authors design four distinct prompt styles to test how different inputs affect model output. They measure performance quantitatively using precision, recall, and F1 scores, and complement this with qualitative analysis. Results show that including label definitions in prompts can improve performance to an extent; however, GPT-4 still struggles with the subtlety required for accurate classification of nuanced language. The study identifies four qualitative findings that highlight specific areas where GPT-4 faces challenges. The comparison with human annotators reveals that although AI shows promise, caution is necessary when applying ChatGPT models to tasks involving complex linguistic subtleties. Overall, the paper emphasizes prudence in relying on generative AI tools like ChatGPT for nuanced language classification, suggesting further refinement and understanding are needed before deployment in sensitive annotation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence tools, like ChatGPT, are an increasingly utilized resource among computational social scientists. Nevertheless, there remains space for improved understanding of the performance of ChatGPT in complex tasks such as classifying and annotating datasets containing nuanced language. Method. In this paper, we measure the performance of GPT-4 on one such task and compare results to human annotators. We investigate ChatGPT versions 3.5, 4, and 4o to examine performance given rapid changes in technological advancement of large language models. We craft four prompt styles as input and evaluate precision, recall, and F1 scores. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of results demonstrate that while including label definitions in prompts may help performance, overall GPT-4 has difficulty classifying nuanced language. Qualitative analysis reveals four specific findings. Our results suggest the use of ChatGPT in classification tasks involving nuanced language should be conducted with prudence.

<div> Keywords: transformer, POS tagging, low-resource languages, Bangla, Hindi

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study introduces a language-agnostic transformer-based framework for part-of-speech (POS) tagging specifically targeting low-resource languages, demonstrated through Bangla and Hindi. The framework’s adaptability is highlighted by the ability to switch from Bangla to Hindi with just three lines of framework-specific code, showcasing its portability and ease of modification. It achieves high token-level accuracy, recording 96.85% for Bangla and 97% for Hindi, and maintains strong F1 scores despite challenges such as dataset imbalance and linguistic overlap. However, performance discrepancies in specific POS categories indicate persistent issues related to dataset curation, emphasizing the importance of data quality. The success of the framework derives from the underlying transformer architecture, which is modular and allows for replacement with minimal coding changes, making it highly flexible. Its open-source nature fosters rapid cross-lingual adaptation, lowering barriers in model design and tuning. Consequently, this enables researchers to concentrate on crucial aspects such as linguistic preprocessing and refining datasets, which are vital steps toward advancing natural language processing capabilities for underrepresented languages. This approach addresses key limitations in current NLP efforts for low-resource settings by combining effectiveness, modularity, and accessibility. <div>
arXiv:2512.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a language-agnostic transformer-based POS tagging framework designed for low-resource languages, using Bangla and Hindi as case studies. With only three lines of framework-specific code, the model was adapted from Bangla to Hindi, demonstrating effective portability with minimal modification. The framework achieves 96.85 percent and 97 percent token-level accuracy across POS categories in Bangla and Hindi while sustaining strong F1 scores despite dataset imbalance and linguistic overlap. A performance discrepancy in a specific POS category underscores ongoing challenges in dataset curation. The strong results stem from the underlying transformer architecture, which can be replaced with limited code adjustments. Its modular and open-source design enables rapid cross-lingual adaptation while reducing model design and tuning overhead, allowing researchers to focus on linguistic preprocessing and dataset refinement, which are essential for advancing NLP in underrepresented languages.

<div> Token Sampling, Entropy Equilibrium Sampling, Large Language Models, Hyperparameter-free, Text Generation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces Entropy Equilibrium Sampling (EES), a novel token sampling method for text generation in large language models (LLMs). EES is designed to dynamically adjust the candidate token sets by balancing normalized entropy with probability mass, based on principles from information theory. Unlike existing sampling strategies, EES does not require additional hyperparameters, eliminating the need for extensive tuning and simplifying deployment. The study evaluates EES on various reasoning and generation tasks across different model architectures, demonstrating consistent strong performance across a wide range of temperature settings. The results indicate that EES achieves a good balance between accuracy, coherence, and diversity in generated text. By removing hyperparameter dependence, EES not only simplifies the use of LLMs but also enhances overall generation quality. Furthermore, the authors provide their code publicly, facilitating adoption and further research. This approach potentially advances practical applications of LLMs by addressing the complexity associated with sampling hyperparameters while maintaining or improving generation effectiveness. <div>

<div> Keywords: Automatic Mixed Precision, Bangla NLP, Transformer Models, Training Efficiency, Computational Resources  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study addresses the challenge of limited computational resources in developing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for Bangla by exploring Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) training. AMP utilizes a combination of 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point arithmetic dynamically during training to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate the process without compromising model accuracy. The authors evaluate AMP's effectiveness on four Bangla NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, error classification, and question answering. Four transformer-based models—BanglaBERT, BanglishBERT, XLM-R, and mBERT—are benchmarked to assess performance impacts. The results reveal that AMP speeds up training by 44.5% and cuts down memory usage by 17.6%. Despite these efficiency gains, the F-1 scores for AMP-trained models remain very close to those of full-precision baselines, retaining 99.7% of their effectiveness. This empirical evidence suggests AMP as a viable method to reduce computational demands, enabling broader access to advanced NLP technologies, especially in regions with constrained hardware resources, like Bangladesh. The findings potentially democratize state-of-the-art NLP development by making it more accessible through lower cost and faster training cycles. <div>

Abstract: Training models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) requires substantial computational resources and time, posing significant challenges, especially for NLP development in Bangla, where access to high-end hardware is often limited. In this work, we explore automatic mixed precision (AMP) training as a means to improve computational efficiency without sacrificing model performance. By leveraging a dynamic mix of 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point computations, AMP lowers GPU memory requirements and speeds up training without degrading model performance. We evaluate AMP across four standard Bangla NLP tasks, namely sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, error classification, and question answering, using four transformer-based models: BanglaBERT, BanglishBERT, XLM-R, and mBERT. Our results demonstrate that AMP accelerates training by 44.5% and reduces memory consumption by 17.6%, while maintaining F-1 score within 99.7% of the full-precision baselines. This empirical study highlights AMP's potential to democratize access to state-of-the-art NLP capabilities in hardware-constrained settings by lowering computational barriers.

<div> Watermarking, Large Language Models, Text Generation, Signal Embedding, Anti-attack Robustness  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of watermarking text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable reliable attribution and secure machine-generated content. Traditional watermarking methods manipulate token generation probabilities but face a trade-off between watermark detectability and text quality. To overcome this, the authors propose a novel embedding scheme that controls seed pools, allowing diverse parallel generation of watermarked text. Based on this, they introduce WaterSearch, a sentence-level, search-based watermarking framework that can adapt to various existing methods. WaterSearch improves text quality by jointly optimizing two key factors: distribution fidelity and watermark signal characteristics. Additionally, a sentence-level detection method is developed, demonstrating strong robustness against attacks. The approach is evaluated across three popular LLMs and ten diverse tasks, showing an average improvement of 51.01% over current state-of-the-art baselines at 95% watermark detectability. In difficult scenarios, such as short-text and low-entropy outputs, WaterSearch yields gains of 47.78% and 36.47%, respectively. Moreover, the method maintains high watermark detectability despite attack scenarios including insertion, synonym substitution, and paraphrase attacks, confirming its robust anti-attack capabilities. The authors have also made their code publicly available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Watermarking acts as a critical safeguard in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). By embedding identifiable signals into model outputs, watermarking enables reliable attribution and enhances the security of machine-generated content. Existing approaches typically embed signals by manipulating token generation probabilities. Despite their effectiveness, these methods inherently face a trade-off between detectability and text quality: the signal strength and randomness required for robust watermarking tend to degrade the performance of downstream tasks.
  In this paper, we design a novel embedding scheme that controls seed pools to facilitate diverse parallel generation of watermarked text. Based on that scheme, we propose WaterSearch, a sentence-level, search-based watermarking framework adaptable to a wide range of existing methods. WaterSearch enhances text quality by jointly optimizing two key aspects: 1) distribution fidelity and 2) watermark signal characteristics. Furthermore, WaterSearch is complemented by a sentence-level detection method with strong attack robustness. We evaluate our method on three popular LLMs across ten diverse tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average performance improvement of 51.01\% over state-of-the-art baselines at a watermark detectability strength of 95\%. In challenging scenarios such as short text generation and low-entropy output generation, our method yields performance gains of 47.78\% and 36.47\%, respectively. Moreover, under different attack senarios including insertion, synonym substitution and paraphrase attasks, WaterSearch maintains high detectability, further validating its robust anti-attack capabilities.

<div> Low-Rank Adaptation, EffiLoRA, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, transformer layers, multimodal models<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the limitations of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models, which still incurs significant overhead and suffers from parameter interference in complex datasets. The authors identify inter-matrix and intra-layer parameter redundancy as key issues and propose EffiLoRA, a Resource-Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation method that is lightweight and generalizable across language, multimodal, and diffusion models. EffiLoRA innovatively employs a unified A matrix shared across all transformer layers to reduce redundancy while introducing runtime selective updates of the B matrices, allowing dynamic trade-offs between system resource consumption and model performance. This adaptive mechanism significantly improves training efficiency compared to traditional LoRA and recent decoupling approaches. The method was tested across diverse tasks, including commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and image generation, where it consistently outperformed LoRA. EffiLoRA demonstrates enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities, making it a practical solution for efficient and scalable fine-tuning across different model modalities and architectures. <div>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), but it still incurs notable overhead and suffers from parameter interference in complex datasets. While re- cent works decouple LoRA update matrices to exploit matrix-wise asymmetry, training costs remain high. We revisit LoRA from the perspective of inter-matrix and intra-layer parameter redundancy and propose Resource-Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation, EffiLoRA, a lightweight and generalizable approach for language, multimodal, and diffusion models. EffiLoRA employs a unified A matrix across all transformer layers and introduces a runtime selective B matrices up- date to dynamically trade-off the system resource budget and model performance. EffiLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA across diverse modalities, including commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and image generation, demon- strating improved efficiency and robustness.

<title>Reward Auditor: Inference on Reward Modeling Suitability in Real-World Perturbed Scenarios</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Reward Models, Large Language Models, Suitability, Reward Auditor, Real-world Perturbations  

<br /><br />Summary: Reliable reward models (RMs) are essential for safely aligning large language models (LLMs). Current evaluation methods mainly measure preference perception accuracy in controlled scenarios, failing to reveal vulnerabilities that arise in realistic settings. The authors highlight the importance of assessing a new dimension called "suitability," which refers to the conditional reliability of RMs under real-world perturbations. To address this, they propose Reward Auditor, a novel hypothesis-testing framework designed to infer RM suitability. Instead of simply evaluating accuracy on given samples, Reward Auditor scientifically audits RMs to detect systematic weaknesses in specific real-world scenarios. It achieves this by analyzing distributional changes in RM preference confidence under perturbations, quantifying both statistical significance and effect size. This approach allows for a clear understanding of the certainty and severity of RM vulnerabilities across diverse conditions. Collectively, this framework establishes a more rigorous foundation for developing next-generation LLM alignment systems that prioritize verifiable safety, robustness, and trustworthiness in practical applications. <div>
arXiv:2512.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable reward models (RMs) are critical for ensuring the safe alignment of large language models (LLMs). However, current evaluation methods focus solely on preference perception accuracies in given specific scenarios, obscuring the critical vulnerabilities of RMs in real-world scenarios. We identify the true challenge lies in assessing a novel dimension: Suitability, defined as conditional reliability under specific real-world perturbations. To this end, we introduce Reward Auditor, a hypothesis-testing framework specifically designed for RM suitability inference. Rather than answering "How accurate is the RM's preference perception for given samples?", it employs scientific auditing to answer: "Can we infer RMs exhibit systematic vulnerabilities in specific real-world scenarios?". Under real-world perturbed scenarios, Reward Auditor quantifies statistical significance and effect size by auditing distribution degradation of RM preference perception confidence. This enables inference of both the certainty and severity of RM vulnerabilities across diverse real-world scenarios. This lays a solid foundation for building next-generation LLM alignment systems that are verifiably safe, more robust, and trustworthy.

This research investigates how prompt engineering (PE) methods affect context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot large language model (LLM) summarisation of scientific abstracts in yeast biotechnology.<br /><br />2. Six instruction-tuned LLMs were tested on eight research paper abstracts using seven different prompt methods: a baseline, two levels of increased instruction complexity (PE-1 and PE-2), two levels of context repetition (CR-K1 and CR-K2), and two levels of random addition (RA-K1 and RA-K2).<br /><br />3. Context repetition methods involved repeating one or two key sentences from the abstract, while random addition involved repeating one or two randomly selected sentences.<br /><br />4. A total of 336 summaries were generated and evaluated on six metrics measuring lexical and semantic alignment: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, METEOR, and cosine similarity.<br /><br />5. Statistical analysis, including BCa bootstrap confidence intervals and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction, was performed on 3744 data points to test four hypotheses about prompt effects.<br /><br />6.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce context inconsistency hallucinations, which are LLM generated outputs that are misaligned with the user prompt. This research project investigates whether prompt engineering (PE) methods can mitigate context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot LLM summarisation of scientific texts, where zero-shot indicates that the LLM relies purely on its pre-training data. Across eight yeast biotechnology research paper abstracts, six instruction-tuned LLMs were prompted with seven methods: a base- line prompt, two levels of increasing instruction complexity (PE-1 and PE-2), two levels of context repetition (CR-K1 and CR-K2), and two levels of random addition (RA-K1 and RA-K2). Context repetition involved the identification and repetition of K key sentences from the abstract, whereas random addition involved the repetition of K randomly selected sentences from the abstract, where K is 1 or 2. A total of 336 LLM-generated summaries were evaluated using six metrics: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, METEOR, and cosine similarity, which were used to compute the lexical and semantic alignment be- tween the summaries and the abstracts. Four hypotheses on the effects of prompt methods on summary alignment with the reference text were tested. Statistical analysis on 3744 collected datapoints was performed using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction. The results demonstrated that CR and RA significantly improve the lexical alignment of LLM-generated summaries with the abstracts. These findings indicate that prompt engineering has the potential to impact hallucinations in zero-shot scientific summarisation tasks.

2. The performance gap between English and Arabic NER systems is caused by several intertwined factors, including tokenization issues, dataset quality, and annotation inconsistencies, which are often studied in isolation.  
3. The paper introduces DeformAr, a novel debugging and evaluation framework specifically designed for transformer-based Arabic NER systems to analyze and explain the observed performance discrepancies.  
4. DeformAr consists of a data extraction library and an interactive dashboard, featuring two evaluation modes: cross-component analysis and behavioural analysis, which jointly evaluate dataset and model components in both languages.  
5. The framework's two-stage analysis first offers systematic diagnostics to uncover the "what," "how," and "why" behind performance differences, followed by behavioural analysis incorporating interpretability techniques, token-level metrics, interactive visualizations, and representation space analysis.  
6. DeformAr enables component-aware diagnostics that link model behaviors to underlying data and representational factors, making it the first Arabic-specific interpretability tool addressing multi-faceted challenges in under-resourced language NER evaluation. <div>

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), demonstrating strong performance in English. However, their effectiveness in Arabic, particularly for Named Entity Recognition (NER), remains limited, even with larger pre-trained models. This performance gap stems from multiple factors, including tokenisation, dataset quality, and annotation inconsistencies. Existing studies often analyze these issues in isolation, failing to capture their joint effect on system behaviour and performance.
  We introduce DeformAr (Debugging and Evaluation Framework for Transformer-based NER Systems), a novel framework designed to investigate and explain the performance discrepancy between Arabic and English NER systems. DeformAr integrates a data extraction library and an interactive dashboard, supporting two modes of evaluation: cross-component analysis and behavioural analysis. The framework divides each language into dataset and model components to examine their interactions.
  The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, cross-component analysis provides systematic diagnostic measures across data and model subcomponents, addressing the "what," "how," and "why" behind observed discrepancies. The second stage applies behavioural analysis by combining interpretability techniques with token-level metrics, interactive visualisations, and representation space analysis. These stages enable a component-aware diagnostic process that detects model behaviours and explains them by linking them to underlying representational patterns and data factors. DeformAr is the first Arabic-specific, component-based interpretability tool, offering a crucial resource for advancing model analysis in under-resourced languages.

<div> Keywords: lightweight LLMs, financial sentiment analysis, open-source models, few-shot learning, multilingual datasets<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper explores the utility of lightweight, open-source large language models (LLMs) in financial markets analysis, focusing on their ability to handle complex and varied textual data such as tweets, news, reports, and microblogs.<br />2. It addresses the challenge that many powerful LLMs require substantial computational resources and proprietary datasets, limiting access for many researchers and practitioners.<br />3. The study compares the benchmark financial NLP model FinBERT with three open-source lightweight LLMs: DeepSeek-LLM 7B, Llama3 8B Instruct, and Qwen3 8B across five public datasets that include FinancialPhraseBank, Financial Question Answering, Gold News Sentiment, Twitter Sentiment, and Chinese Finance Sentiment.<br />4. Results show that models Qwen3 8B and Llama3 8B achieve the best performance in most scenarios, even with only 5% of the available training data, highlighting their effectiveness in zero-shot and few-shot learning settings.<br />5. The findings suggest that lightweight, open-source LLMs represent a cost-effective solution for financial sentiment analysis and can generalize well across heterogeneous textual data, reducing dependence on large annotated datasets and computational resources. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) play an increasingly important role in finan- cial markets analysis by capturing signals from complex and heterogeneous textual data sources, such as tweets, news articles, reports, and microblogs. However, their performance is dependent on large computational resources and proprietary datasets, which are costly, restricted, and therefore inacces- sible to many researchers and practitioners. To reflect realistic situations we investigate the ability of lightweight open-source LLMs - smaller and publicly available models designed to operate with limited computational resources - to generalize sentiment understanding from financial datasets of varying sizes, sources, formats, and languages. We compare the benchmark finance natural language processing (NLP) model, FinBERT, and three open-source lightweight LLMs, DeepSeek-LLM 7B, Llama3 8B Instruct, and Qwen3 8B on five publicly available datasets: FinancialPhraseBank, Financial Question Answering, Gold News Sentiment, Twitter Sentiment and Chinese Finance Sentiment. We find that LLMs, specially Qwen3 8B and Llama3 8B, perform best in most scenarios, even from using only 5% of the available training data. These results hold in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Our findings indicate that lightweight, open-source large language models (LLMs) consti- tute a cost-effective option, as they can achieve competitive performance on heterogeneous textual data even when trained on only a limited subset of the extensive annotated corpora that are typically deemed necessary.
